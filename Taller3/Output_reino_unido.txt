Video report by ITV News Political Correspondent Romilly Weeks Regulated rail fares in England will be cut by a third from next month if Labour wins the General Election. Jeremy Corbyn intends to re-nationalise the railways when contracts expire if he wins the December 12 vote and has announced plans to cut regulated rail fares by 33% from January 2020. The party estimates the policy would save the average commuter more than 1,000 a year, and says it would represent the biggest ever reduction in rail fares. Rail fares to go up by 2.7%: Why do prices rise every year? Labour pledges to make England more cycling-friendly Labour promise 'investment blitz' as party gears up to launch manifesto for every English region It also comes on the day that South Western Railway's 27-day train strike gets underway, making this a timely announcement. The strike is the longest stretch of action against a major rail operator in living memory. Services will be cancelled, replaced by buses or finish earlier than normal, and trains that do run are expected to be busier than normal. Labour's pledge also follows Britains train companies announcement over the weekend that they will hike prices by an average of 2.7% next year. Children aged 16 and under would receive free rail travel under the partys plans, while part time workers would be guaranteed fair fares. Labour has also pledged to deliver a simple, London-style ticketing system across the nation  with islands within which zonal rail fares will apply across all modes of public transport. There would be a daily price cap so travellers can pay as they go using bank cards or mobile phones. Labour estimates that the policy will cost 1.5 billion per year and would come from existing Department for Transport budgets, drawn from Vehicle Excise Duty. Mr Corbyn said: Travelling by train is my favourite way of getting around the country but for too long a fragmented and privatised rail system has ripped-off passengers. Taking back control of our railways is the only way to bring down fares and create a railway network that is fit for the future. Labour will bring about real change on the railways because we are on the side of passengers. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald added: Privatisation has created one of the most complex, exploitative and expensive ticketing systems in the world. Labour will scrap the bewildering and outdated fares and ticketing system that discriminates against part-time workers, discourages rail travel and excludes the young and low paid. Labour is on the side of passengers which is why we will introduce a simpler, fairer and more affordable system for all, integrated with other forms of public transport. Rail passengers who want to save hundreds or thousands of pounds next year need to vote Labour on December 12. Labour will deliver a railway in public ownership for the many, not the few. Responding to the announcement, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: This is another desperate attempt from Labour to distract from their inability and unwillingness to be straight with people on where they stand on Brexit, and the fact they would raise taxes on low and middle income workers across the country. The Conservatives will improve punctuality by integrating parts of the rail network, make ticketing and pricing more transparent and will invest 500 million in reopening branch lines closed under Labour. You simply cannot trust Corbyn to deliver what he claims. His ideological plans would wreck our economy, cost people their livelihoods and with the help of Nicola Sturgeon would waste the whole of next year on two more chaotic referendums. A spokesperson for the Rail Delivery Group, commenting on behalf of train operators, said: Rail companies have been calling for some time for changes in regulation to enable an easier to use, better value range of fares but its a red herring to suggest that reforming fares needs a change of ownership. Overall fare levels will always be a matter for elected politicians in deciding the balance of farepayer and taxpayer funding. Train companies would obviously support a reduction for passengers as long as it is funded on an ongoing basis so that investment to improve the railway can continue. Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union said:A third off fares in the new year and making travel free for under 16s will not only save passengers thousands of pounds, it will transform travel for the future, increasing rail passenger numbers and rail jobs to help fight the climate crisis. This is rail public ownership that delivers real change to benefit everyone.Parties are set to resume their General Election campaigns in earnest as they seek to move on from the political row over the London Bridge terrorist attack. With just 10 days to go until the polls open, Jeremy Corbyn will announce plans to slash regulated rail fares in England by a third from next month if his party enters government. The Tories, meanwhile, are setting out a range of measures to strengthen border security after Brexit including automated entrance and exit checks to identify individuals who have overstayed their visa. Boris Johnson and Mr Corbyn cancelled some planned campaign events over the weekend after former University of Cambridge students Saskia Jones, 23, and Jack Merritt, 25, were fatally stabbed on Friday. The prime minister has cancelled campaigning on Monday morning to attend to matters related to the London Bridge attack instead. Clashes over Brexit and London Bridge attack as seven main parties go head to head in ITV debate 'Men say dreadful things sometimes': Nigel Farage seeks to defend Donald Trump in ITV Election Debate Mr Johnson sought to blame Labour for Khans early release, while Mr Corbyn said convicted terrorists should not necessarily serve their full prison sentence. The Liberal Democrats criticised both parties for seeking to use the incident as a political football. Moving on from the row, Mr Corbyn will use a visit to a railway station on Monday morning to announce plans to cut regulated rail fares by 33% from January 2020 if he wins the election. Labour estimates the policy would save the average commuter more than 1,000 a year, and says it would represent the biggest ever reduction in rail fares. It comes after Britains train companies confirmed over the weekend that they will hike prices by an average of 2.7% next year. Children aged 16 and under would receive free rail travel under the partys plans, while part time workers would be guaranteed fair fares. Labour has also pledged to deliver a simple, London-style ticketing system across the nation  with islands within which zonal rail fares will apply across all modes of public transport. They estimate that the policy will cost 1.5 billion per year and would come from existing Department for Transport budgets, drawn from vehicle excise duty. Mr Johnson had planned visit a port on Monday as his party unveils a five-point plan to strengthen border security after Brexit. People will be counted in and out of the country as part of the proposals that would also make biometric passports a requirement and see the introduction of an American-style visa waiver scheme. The party hopes the Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) would provide an enhanced ability to screen arrivals against watchlists and block those deemed to be a threat from entering the UK. Elsewhere on the campaign trail, the Liberal Democrats have pledged to invest an additional 11 billion over five years into transforming mental health services. The party said it would make prescriptions for people with chronic mental health conditions available for free on the NHS among a raft of measures to improve services.Nigel Farage came under fire when trying to defend Donald Trump's attitude to women. During a particularly heated exchange on the ITV Leaders' Debate Mr Farage was challenged on whether the US president's language was acceptable. "It was crass, it was crude and it was wrong - and men say dreadful things sometimes," said Brexit Party leader Mr Farage. "But you know something, if all of us were caught out on what we said on a night out after a drink... none of us would be here," before he was drowned out by the panel. Mr Farage took aim at Jo Swinson, Liberal Democrat leader, saying "I'm sure you've lived the purest life of anybody" when she tackled him again on the issue. The panel was discussing the so-called special relationship between Boris Johnson and whether Mr Trump was someone the UK should be working closely with. Rishi Sunak, for the Conservatives, said Mr Trump was incredibly important ally for the UK. But Adam Price, Plaid Cymru leader, said words matter. "It can never be acceptable for a man to talk about grabbing a woman's p***y," he said. "If you think it is, you should be ashamed of yourself." He went on: "The sad reality is, is that we have a gay man, like myself as b** boys in tank tops, referred to Muslim women looking like letterboxes. "This is creating the climate where abuse become acceptable, whether it be women or minorities and that's why neither Trump nor Johnson are fit to be in public office." He went on: "The sad reality is, is that we have a gay man, like myself as b** boys in tank tops, referred to Muslim women looking like letterboxes. "This is creating the climate where abuse become acceptable, whether it be women or minorities and that's why neither Trump nor Johnson are fit to be in public office."Video report by ITV News Political Correspondent Daniel Hewitt The seven main parties went head-to-head for the second ITV televised debate, with clashes on the London Bridge attack, Brexit and the nuclear deterrent taking centre stage. Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson skipped the debate, instead sending Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak to appear in their place. While Brexit leader Nigel Farage was speaking at his first televised debate of the 2019 campaign. Joining Mr Farage was Jo Swinson of the Liberal Democrats, the SNPs Nicola Sturgeon, Sian Berry, co-leader of the Green Party and Plaid Cymrus Adam Price. Here is a rundown of the key moments from the debate: London Bridge terror attack The first question was on the London Bridge terror attack and why convicted terrorist Usman Khan was freed halfway through a 16-year jail sentence. Conservative Rishi Sunak said it was because of a law change brought in under the Labour government in 2008, but Mr Burgon says it is because of public service cuts. Mr Sunak blamed the last Labour government for "weakening" sentencing to allow violent criminals out of prison early. Representing the Tories in the ITV election debate, Treasury Chief Secretary Rishi Sunak said Usman Khan had been released as result of changes brought in by the Last Labour government. "He was released due to a law passed in 2008 under the last Labour government where people were released automatically halfway through their sentence." he said. "We changed that law in 2012 and if he had been sentenced under out rules he would still be in jail." For Labour, shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said it was "not true" that the only option at the time was automatic release of Khan halfway of through his sentence. "People don't want history lessons after this terrorist atrocity. What people want is to put victims first and put keeping communities safe first." While Nigel Farage says anyone with the "virus of jihadism" should never be let out of prison, unless authorities can be sure they no longer have extremist views. He accused both the Tories and Labour of being too lenient on sentencing. Mr Farage said: "I don't care if these people were in jail for six years or 12 years. If you have committed mass murder or planned to commit mass murder, you're not just a normal criminal, you've got the virus of jihadism. "I think these people should never, ever be let out of prison unless we can be absolutely convinced they do not have the jihadi virus, but of course, political correctness stops us from doing this." While Jo Swinson said lessons have to be learnt from the attack, a point backed by Nicola Sturgeon and attacked Boris Johnson for the "crass" way he has "politicised" the attack. Brexit The second question was about Brexit and whether any of the parties' policies will bring the country back together. Ms Swinson said the best way to bring the country forward is to remain in the EU, in order to "end the chaos of Brexit." However Labour's Mr Burgon argues the only way to bring the country forward is another Brexit referendum - a move supported by SNP's Nicola Sturgeon. But Mr Sunak attacked the proposal as "ridiculous". Special relationship On the UK-US special relationship, Jo Swinson says President Donald Trump "is not represent someone who shares our value" and the Conservatives should not have rolled out a red carpet for him. She has said there are three people in the special relationship - Donald Trump, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage. Ms Swinson says the relationship developed between Mr Trump and the Conservatives is "shocking." The Lib Dem leader said: "This is someone who has boasted about sexually assaulting women, whose policies are discriminatory people with different backgrounds, and is seperating parents from their children at the border. "We should be very careful with that relationship. The last thing we should have done is roll out the red carpet for him." While Labour's Richard Burgon said the president wants access to the NHS and the UK's drugs market. "He wants to conspire with Boris Johnson and the leader of the Brexit Party, in order to get his fat cat friends to have access to our NHS," Mr Burgon added. But Rishi Sunak says the US is a "great ally" for the UK, and "it is important the prime minister builds alliances" around the world "that further our British interest." The biggest clash of the night so far came when Mr Farage sought to defend Mr Trump's comments about sexually assaulting women, which drew the biggest reaction from the audience. The Brexit Party leader said: "It was crass and it was crude and it was wrong and men say dreadful things sometimes." But Plaid Cymru's Adam Price responded by saying: It can never be acceptable for a man to talk about grabbing a womans p***y Spending pledges The third question was on spending pledges and who would lose out, to which Labour's Richard Burgon responded by saying their manifesto is fully-costed. Rishi Sunak said when they came into power they inherited a Government on "the brink of bankruptcy" and labelled Labour's spending plans as "reckless". "We know who will pay for this...hard working Brits up and down the country, and that's the risk that must be avoided," Mr Sunak said. While the Green Party and the Lib Dems clashed over their environment policies, with the Green's Sian Berry accusing the Lib Dems "there's no capital investment in your plans." Ms Berry said their policies will pay for themselves and will help reduce carbon emissions. While Nigel Farage accused Labour and the Conservatives of "lying to everybody" about their plans for the economy. To which Nicola Sturgeon responded by saying she was "taken away" by hearing Mr Farage of accusing other people of lying, drawing on the fact he had the 350m false NHS claim plastered on his Brexit campaign bus. Can political parties work together? The next question is whether the political parties can come together to tackle social care and climate change. But Labour's Richard Burgon says: "I don't believe that we can work with the Conservative Party on virtually anything." Let's get the Tories out and get a Labour government in, he added. Lib Dems leader Jo Swinson admits this election campaign has been "polarised" but said her party, the Green Party and Plaid Cymru are working together to stop Brexit. While Sian Berry and Nigel Farage clashed on the matter of renewable energy, with the Brexit Party leader claiming the poor will be the ones paying and the wealthy given large subsidies. Opening statements The debate opened with Sian Berry saying we are going through "dark and dangerous times" and said "Brexit will change things for the worse." She focused her opening speech on climate change and urged voters to "shine a light in the darkness with your vote." While Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said "Boris Johnson can't be bothered to turn out" to debate the other parties and spoke of her "love of our country" and claims Nigel Farage is happy to help the Conservatives win the General Election. Tory representative Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak repeated the Conservative mantra in his opening speech to "Get Brexit Done." He said his party will bring the Brexit deal back to Parliament before Christmas, to focus on other priorities and says it is the "only way to move on." While Brexit leader Nigel Farage claims most of the parties do not want to honour the result of the Brexit referendum. He said his party are the "new radicals" and he wanted to "get back to being a functioning democracy." Nicola Sturgeon, SNP leader, said she wants to lock Boris Johnson out of Downing Street and that trade talks have not yet started. "To build a better future we need to stop Boris Johnson and the Tories and in Scotland that means voting SNP," Ms Sturgeon said. Plaid Cymrus Adam Price said Wales is invisible to Westminster and said his party would "put our people first." And Labour's Richard Burgon started his speech by giving condolences to the victims of the London Bridge terror attack. But said the justice system "has been hollowed out" and said public services were stretched, but says Labour "will be on your side." Closing statements The closing statement bring the debate to an end, with Nigel Farage closing first, saying the competition was one about who "can be the most politically correct". He said the Brexit Party "would get Brexit done and reform political institutions", while Rishi Sunak said the Tories would deliver Brexit by the end of January. Mr Sunak argues the alternative is Jeremy Corbyn who he says is "ridiculously stuck in neutral" and the Tories are the only party who "can set Britain free." Labour's Richard Burgon ended by saying they were the party who created the NHS and wants to bring in the 10 national wage, reminding the voters they were the party "for the many, not the few." Adam Price highlighted the issue of child poverty in Wales: "We could give all our children the best Christmas present ever - the hope of a better future." While Sian Berry said the Green Party are "the future" and would end climate chaos. Jo Swinson repeated her pledge of ending the Brexit chaos and says her party is the only one to stop Boris Johnson. An assurance, Nicola Sturgeon repeated, saying: "A vote for the SNP is a vote to lock Boris Johnson out of Downing Street."
