longer jail terms for serious offenders community punishments including 20-hour a day curfews and the use of satellite monitoring for convicted burglars are among measures set out in a shake up of sentencing powers the sentencing white paper also contains measures aimed at helping rehabilitate offenders with more flexible community orders allowing them to carry on working in the week and reducing the time before a conviction is classed as spent justice secretary robert buckland who will set out further details on wednesday said the measures would result in a system that was fairer smarter and ultimately better protects the public prime minister boris johnson has already said the reforms will make it easier for judges to put dangerous offenders behind bars for longer but the package covering in england and wales will also include measures at the lower end of the sentencing spectrum justice secretary i will resign if ministers break law in unacceptable way teenage killers could face longer jail terms after campaign by mother of murdered wiltshire teenager ellie gould community sentences given to offenders instead of prison will be made tougher by doubling the length of time offenders can be subject to curfew restrictions to two years the orders can be made more flexible to help offenders keep their jobs for example by having fewer restrictions from monday to friday but then stricter curfews of up to 20 hours at weekends in an effort to tackle reoffending for the first time gps electronic location monitoring will be routinely used to track burglars robbers and thieves when they are released from prison the technology will allow probation to monitor an offenders whereabouts and if appropriate share this data with the police for criminals who stay out of trouble the requirement to routinely disclose offences to employers for non - sensitive roles will be reduced custodial sentences of up to a year will become spent after a further 12 months without reoffending instead of four years while terms of one to four years will no longer be disclosed after four crime free years down from seven sentences of more than four years will not automatically be disclosed to employers once a seven year period of rehabilitation has been served instead of for the rest of an offenders life other measures in the white paper include whole life orders for child killers including the ability for judges to hand out this maximum punishment to 18 - 20 year olds in exceptional cases new powers to halt the automatic release of offenders who pose a terrorism risk or are a danger to the public ending the release of offenders sentenced to four seven years at the halfway point instead requiring them to serve two thirds of their term longer minimum sentences for 15 - 17 year old murderers prisoners sentenced to life will serve longer before being eligible for parole mr buckland said for too long our justice system has been beset by complex and confusing laws which the public often feel fail in their most essential aims to keep them safe and properly punish offenders that ends today this white paper is the first step in a fundamental shift in our approach to sentencing towards one that is fairer smarter and ultimately better protects the public early release scheme paused after six prisoners mistakenly freed our measures will ensure the most serious violent and sexual offenders get the prison time they deserve while new community interventions and changes to rules around criminal records will help boost rehabilitation and cut reoffending which means creating fewer victims the government has set a target of 20,000 extra police officers but mr johnson told the cabinet on tuesday that there s no point in catching the criminals if they are simply going to be let out early he said we have seen far too many cases recently of criminals being let out early and then offending again and the judges being unable to impose the stiff sentences that they want and that society wants because of the restrictive guidelines that they face video report by itv news political correspondent paul brand the health secretary has said it could take weeks to resolve issues around coronavirus testing after he admitted there are operational challenges related to a surge in demand there have been widespread complaints that the uk 's testing regime is inadequate with some people being forced to drive for hours to get a test and others having to wait days for appointments or returned results nhs providers the body representing hospital trusts in england earlier issued a plea to the government for the testing regime to improve saying staff are being kept out of work unnecessarily because test shortages in a scathing review of the government 's testing regime the body said it is clear there are capacity problems in a statement it said nhs staff are having to self isolate in the absence of a test for either them or their loved ones taking valuable nhs staff away from the frontline where they are needed health secretary matt hancock speaking in the commons said a new prioritisation list would be published setting out who will be at the front of the queue for tests but he admitted it could be a matter of weeks before the problems are resolved we have seen a sharp rise in people coming forward for a test including those who are not eligible mr hancock said throughout this pandemic we have prioritised testing according to need over the summer when demand was low we were able to meet all requirements for testing whether priorities or not but as demand has risen so we are having to prioritise once again and i do not shirk from decisions about prioritisation they are not always comfortable but they are important acute clinical care is the top priority mr hancock added with social care next on the list meanwhile one care home manager told itv news about the problems they are facing with testing including long waits for results if they get them at all those working in the care sector now get weekly tests but the delays in obtaining results complicates matters some tests do nt even come back care home manager debbie adams told itv news i ve had one member of staff where it has nt come back twice we ve done it and were about to do it again its over five days until we get the test back according to ms adams the testing system has got worse since it was put in place other care homes have told itv news it has take more than seven days to get results meaning it is time for them to get another test by the time the last one is completed meanwhile shadow health secretary jonathan ashworth accused mr hancock of losing control of this virus nhs providers chief executive chris hopson said there was a lack of detailed operational information on the shortages such as how long they will last which means hospitals are having to work in the dark coronavirus ministers ' failed to act on early advice to protect care homes sage member reveals coronavirus case numbers rise by 2,621 as testing issues plague uk its clear that there are current capacity problems with the testing regime he said adding how trust leaders across the country had all raised concerns about the lack of testing leading to greater levels of staff absence its not just access for tests for staff members themselves its also access for their family members as nhs workers have to self isolate if their family members are unable to confirm if they have covid-19 or not the problem is that nhs trusts are working in the dark they do nt know why these shortages are occurring how long they are likely to last how geographically widespread they are likely to be and what priority will be given to healthcare workers and their families in accessing scarce tests he said bosses need to this information so they can plan accordingly for example by establishing their own testing facilities meanwhile labour has called on the government to set out a clear winter plan to protect care homes amid signs they are experiencing a new rise in covid-19 cases home secretary priti patel defended the testing regime saying the government has always prioritised people on the front line and in the nhs she insisted the priority has been constantly to bolster and increase testing capacity in the areas where they need it most but she admitted much more work needs to be undertaken withpublic health england and public health bodies in those particular local areas leader of the house of commons jacob rees mogg on his way out of a cabinet meeting claimed testing is actually a government success i think it 's going as well as can possibly be expected considering the demand nhs providers say the capacity issues are causing a huge ripple effect throughout the health service with a lack of tests not only forcing staff out of work but also keeping patients away from treatment were aware of a small number of examples of patients being unable to get such tests which cuts across trusts ability to restore services in the way they have been asked to do mr hopson said we are concerned for example that patients waiting for hospital treatment can no longer highlight this fact when applying online to access a test we need to prioritise tests for healthcare workers and their families and patients coming in for treatment many of whom have already waited longer than normal our recent survey showed how concerned trust leaders were about the impact of inadequate testing on their ability to restore services and its disappointing that no detailed information on the current problems has been shared nhs providers has urged the government to be more honest over problems with coronavirus testing as a senior doctor said a fit for purpose system is needed now mr hopson accused the government of being more concerned about dealing with the political implications of operational problems rather than fixing them what happens when you get a test and trace call the government response has often been to rely on a random impressive sounding overall statistic the number of tests performed or ppe items delivered or to set out a bold future ambition a world class test and trace service by june or a moonshot testing regime at some point next year he said trust leaders are frustrated that throughout the pandemic the government has always seemed more concerned with managing the political implications of operational problems rather than being open and honest about them those approaches ignore the operational problem at hand he said he cited shortages of ppe and testing reagents earlier in the crisis as being good examples of government failings health secretary matt hancock admitted last week that there had been challenges in access to tests but insisted that the vast majority of people get their tests rapidly and close to home residents in bolton where the infection rate is the highest in england have complained of long delays in trying to book a test and in some cases being offered appointments in other areas of the uk council chiefs have urged the government to treat major flaws with the online booking system for tests as a matter of the utmost priority council leaders in sefton merseyside and bury greater manchester urged people to only apply for a test if they had symptoms or had been asked to do so amid reports of a rise in requests from those without symptoms an nhs spokeswoman said hospital labs have been asked to further expand their successful fast turnaround and highly accurate testing capacity to support the test and trace programme the world health organisations director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said on monday that testing was one of the public health basics countries need to do well to be able to reopen their societies economies and borders safely test and trace contact tracing rate at lowest since launch nhs coronavirus test and trace ' shambolic frustrating unfit for purpose says call handler significant further restrictions on our freedom to mix with people in social or work settings could be introduced in a fortnight if the rule of six does not lead to behavioural change and a flattening of the coronavirus infection rate i have spoken to members of the government and to its scientific advisers and am struck by how anxious they are that the virus may be spreading out of control again one member of the scientific advisory group for emergencies sage told me my big worry now is that we might be too late again to avert a major second wave if we wait for deaths to go up again before taking decisive action we will be in trouble again peston how serious is the shortage of coronavirus tests exclusive nhs coronavirus test and trace ' shambolic frustrating unfit for purpose 119 call handler tells itv news a senior member of the government told me he was acutely aware of the scientists concern there is no possibility of us waiting for the death rate to rise before we act he said he added the time frame for assessing whether this weeks new rule of six had done enough to suppress the virus is a fortnight there is a view at the top of government that pretty much every social distancing measure should be contemplated other than school closures a leading scientific advisor told me lockdown is the only thing that we know works to be frank i think that if we want to keep schools open we probably have to give serious consideration to a wide range of other measures to stop a major second wave and we have to think about doing that right now which we are starting to do further restrictions on our way of life will split the governing tory party many conservative mps disapprove even of the new legally enforceable rule in england that we must never meet in groups of more than six and its variants in scotland wales and northern ireland the prime minister has talked of a return to something like national lockdown as a nuclear option a last resort but his and the health secretary matt hancocks preference for targeted local action has been dealt a significant blow by the sudden overwhelming of the covid-19 testing system by a surge in demand which means it is now much more difficult for nhs test and trace to identify precisely where the virus is spreading hancock faces a massive quandary in trying to match capacity more closely with those who need tests it will take weeks to significantly increase processing capacity so he is contemplating asking gps to act as gatekeepers to the testing system which would mean those wanting a test could only get one if their local doctor were to authorise it but introducing gp screening would undermine the timeliness of the data since it would add at least another 24 hours to the process of wanting or needing a test and getting the result i understand hancock is very reluctant to assign this responsibility to gps but he may have no alternative labour leader sir keir starmer will not take part in prime ministers questions on wednesday as he is still awaiting a coronavirus test result for a member of his family a spokesperson said the labour leader will be replaced at the despatch box by his deputy angela rayner while he remains in self isolation sir keir was advised to self isolate on monday after a member of his household showed possible symptoms of coronavirus when should you get a coronavirus test a spokesman said on tuesday keir starmer is still awaiting the test result for a member of his family he is therefore remaining in self isolation and will not participate in prime ministers questions tomorrow angela rayner deputy leader and shadow first secretary of state will be taking his place we have informed number 10 at last weeks pmqs sir keir accused the government of not being able to get the basics right following reports that people were being denied covid-19 tests a new rule of six restriction is being implemented in much of the uk but restrictions are different depending on which country you live in the rules designed to slow the spread of coronavirus are being enforced in england wales and scotland from monday with divergence between each uk nation causing confusion here 's an explanation of how the rules work wherever you are six person limit could be in place for months sparking christmas concerns england from monday gatherings of more than six people will be illegal as boris johnson announced in his recent downing street press conference the rules will apply across england to all ages and in any setting either indoors and outdoors at home or a pub a single household or support bubble that is larger than six will still be able to gather covid secure venues like places of worship gyms restaurants and hospitality settings can still hold more than six in total education and work settings are not affected by the new rules weddings and funerals can still go ahead with a limit of 30 people if conducted in a covid secure way wales people in wales will only be able to meet in groups of six or under indoors and must all belong to the same extended household group up to four households are able to join together to form an extended household but unlike in england children under 11 will be exempt and will not count towards that total face coverings to become compulsory in wales and social gatherings of more than six people banned under stricter rules also unlike in england people will also still be able to meet up in groups of up to 30 outdoors as long as social distancing is maintained the changes will not apply in caerphilly county borough due to its rise in covid-19 cases scotland a maximum of six people from two households will be allowed to meet together in scotland just like in england the new limit applies when people meet in restaurants pubs and beer gardens as well as in homes however children under the age of 12 who are part of the two households meeting will not count towards the limit of six people first minister nicola sturgeon has said there will be some limited exceptions covering organised sports and places of worship up to 20 people will be able to attend weddings civil partnerships and funerals as well as receptions and wakes which is more stringent than both england and wales northern ireland in northern ireland the number of people who can gather indoors in a private home was already reduced from 10 people from four households to six people from two households last month due to a rise in covid-19 cases up to 15 people can meet outdoors coronavirus restrictions have made it illegal to mingle under the new rule of six but priti patel has been struggling to define what it means the home secretary claimed mingling means people coming together and suggested groups who create a gathering of more than six by unintentionally bumping into each other could be fined for breaking the rules asked if two families of four stopping for a chat was banned ms patel said it is mingling i think its absolutely mingling but regulation 5 of the health protection regulations suggests the home secretary 's definition of mingling is wrong mingling banned under new coronavirus rules as priti patel urges public to report neighbours for breaches public should report rule of six breakers to police says minister explained how the new rule of six ' restrictions differ across the uk the ban on mingling has a specific context which relates to events organised by charities businesses or public authorities the legislation says anyone in a qualifying group allowed to attend the event must not otherwise mingle with any person who is participating in the gathering but is not a member of the same qualifying group as them human rights barrister adam wagner said there is no definition of mingling though patel offered one as people coming together that is probably wrong too wide after ms patel gave her definition to bbc radio former tory mp anna soubry tweeted this is complete nonsense she wrote priti patel tells # today if a family of 4 comes across another family of 4 in the street who they know & they stop for a chat they are mingling & have committed a criminal offence this is complete nonsense & we risk a total breakdown on # covid19 rule compliance ms patel also earlier urged people to call the police on their neighbours if they spot a coronavirus rule breach asked whether people should report their neighbours over breaches priti patel said where people are being non - compliant of course they will absolutely do what they consider to be the right thing and look for enforcement illegal gatherings should have enforcement undertaken she added which is why police have the powers to issue fixed penalty fines this is not new police have been enforcing through coronavirus regulations for this very purpose to stop the spread of coronavirus human rights barrister adam wagner tweeted it 's illegal to mingle what does mingle mean is saying hello to someone at a gathering mingling what about holding the door open for them the home secretary has urged members of the public to call the police on their neighbours if they see breaches of coronavirus restrictions the new rules have been criticised for not being clear for unusual clauses such as a ban on mingling and for the long list of exemptions the rule of six which came into force on monday restricts people to gatherings of six people or less and police have powers to break up larger groups asked whether people should report their neighbours over breaches priti patel said where people are being non - compliant of course they will absolutely do what they consider to be the right thing and look for enforcement illegal gatherings should have enforcement undertaken she added which is why police have the powers to issue fixed penalty fines this is not new police have been enforcing through coronavirus regulations for this very purpose to stop the spread of coronavirus people face fines of 100

on the numbers of adults or children guidance for police was only published by the government on sunday hours before the new rules came intro force policing minister kit malthouse said on monday anyone who was concerned about too many people gathering in one place should consider reporting it if they think there is a gathering of concern they should call the non - emergency number and let police know he said he added that covid marshals would be explaining and advising potential rule breakers about the new guidelines mr malthouse said the marshals had been working in leeds and cornwall very well but that if necessary police would be called in to deal with potential illegal gatherings video report by itv news political editor robert peston in a new series coronavirus what happened itv news looks at the decisions the government made during the early stages of the pandemic examining issues such as why vulnerable residents in care homes were put at serious risk why health care workers struggled to obtain vital protective equipment and why the uk did not increase virus testing capacity much earlier than it did ministers failed to act on early advice to protect care home residents from coronavirus a member of the government 's scientific advisory group for emergencies(sage has revealed epidemiologist john edmunds also admitted sage should have been bolder in the guidance it gave to ministers when advising the government on how to combat the spread of covid-19 he told itv news political editor robert peston that the government was warned about care homes being particularly high risk as early as february and ministers were told they should stop infection getting into care homes despite this until april 15 the government 's advice to hospitals was negative tests are not required prior to transfers / admissions into the care home that advice resulted in over a month passing in which thousands of hospital patients were discharged into care homes with coronavirus symptoms over 20,000 care home residents have died from coronavirus related illness since covid-19 hit the uk mr edmunds said the advice to hospitals prior to april 15 makes no sense at all he said advice was given to ministers in february and sage then moved on to other matters as the issue in care homes was so obvious sage just gave scientific advice he said scientific advice being care homes are particularly high risk you should stop infection getting into care homes and do everything you can to stop infection once it 's in care homes he added it 's up to others to action that and do it and that clearly failed the government hit back saying it was guided by the latest scientific advice at every stage of the pandemic john edmunds early on it was discussed that care homes were a risk on 13 march care homes received advice on infection control and isolating residents or staff displaying symptoms and this advice was continually updated as the situation changed a spokesperson said in a statement another widely acknowledged error made by the government was the decision to abandon its community testing and contact tracing strategy on march 12 just as the virus was reaching its peak former health secretary jeremy hunt said the government would have known how unbelievably important mass testing was had it learned the lessons from sars epidemic another coronavirus which began in china in the early 2000s mr hunt who now chairs the health and social care committee believes the error on testing was made because ministers were treating the virus as though it was similar to flu jeremy hunt there was a groupthink that this virus would be like flu there was a kind of group think that this was a flu like virus which would be virtually impossible to stop he said all our preparations for pandemics had been preparations for pandemic flu which are the viruses we had seen in this country not for a pandemic sars like virus mr hunt said there were clues coming from asia as early as january that this was going to be different china south korea then taiwan singapore and hong kong managed to contain to the spread of the virus to less than 1 % of the population which is something that would be very difficult to do with pandemic flu he said he added if we had learnt the lessons of sars we would have see that mess testing is unbelievably important with this type of virus mr edmunds a professor at the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine admitted sage 's advice to the government could have been stronger asked how that could happen he said i think we did become bolder i think at the beginning i do n't think timid is the right word but i think we did become bolder he admitted it took a long time for the advice to become stronger but said the enormous price the uk has paid in the fight against coronavirus was not down to sage being timid edmunds admits sage could have been bolder at start of crisis mr edmunds said widespread testing was abandoned due to issues with capacity which meant vast numbers of people who needed tests could not get one what we were probably doing was just working within constraints rather than saying these restraints are mad we need far more capacity i think that was a mistake i ca nt speak for sage but speaking on my own terms that 's a mistake i should n't have made i 'm sure others would say similarly he said who are the experts advising the government how to ease lockdown exclusive sage scientist tells peston coronavirus cases increasing exponentially peston what was the governments biggest coronavirus mistake another mistake made by ministers mr hunt said was believing the idea of herd immunity mr edmunds said herd immunity the strategy of letting the virus pass through the population in order to achieve levels of immunity was was never a strategy to follow that we discussed he said both scientists and ministers had accepted that there were four stages of the epidemic containment delay research and mitigation the early strategy for dealing with the virus was built around the idea that at some point the virus would be impossible to contain mr hunt said i do nt think the scientists advising the government welcomed the idea of herd immunity i think they were resigned to it hunt says scientists and ministers were resigned to the idea of herd immunity i think they thought once this establishes itself it will be impossible to stop it spreading to less than 60 % of the population he added i think that was obviously the wrong approach because if you have a disease that at the time had about a 1 % mortality rate you have a moral obligation to do everything in your power to stop it spreading and hope that something might come up we 've learned from taiwan and south korea and other asian democracies is that you can get public consent for really quite draconian measures professor edmunds said measure such as lockdown and border closures were unthinkable at the start of the pandemic he said advice back in early february was based on projections and models that scientists were enormously uncertain about to close our borders the economic impact is enormous he said i think it was just unthinkable back then to take those really extreme measures which are now in place same with the lockdown in some sense that 's not very different to putting the whole country under house arrest for indeterminate it 's really an extreme measure it worked i 'm really glad we did it but it was unthinkable really early on responding a government spokesperson said our strategy to delay contain research and mitigate was clear from the start its categorically wrong to say herd immunity was our aim which has always been to save lives and protect the nhs boris johnson 's controversial plan to override key elements of the brexit deal he signed with brussels has cleared its first commons hurdle despite deep misgivings by some senior tories mps voted to give the uk internal market bill a second reading by 340 to 263 a government majority of 77 the prime minister said the legislation was necessary to prevent the eu taking an extreme and unreasonable interpretation of the provisions in the withdrawal agreement relating to northern ireland he said some in brussels were now threatening to block uk agri food exports to the eu and to insist on tariffs on all goods moving to northern ireland from the rest of the uk but what is the bill and why has it made so many people including tory backbenchers angry the internal markets bill prime minister johnson proposed the implementation of the internal markets bill it is a piece of legislation that will override aspects of the withdrawal agreement which was signed by both the eu and uk in october if implemented the bill will end the legal legitimacy of the northern ireland protocol contained within the withdrawal agreement in areas such as customs and state aid and financial assistance david cameron follows all other living ex - pms in criticising boris johnson 's plan to override brexit deal brussels could carve up uk if tories reject controversial brexit bill says pm it will ensure goods from northern ireland continue to have unfettered access to the uk market while making clear eu state aid a subsidy or any other aid provided by a government that distorts competitions rules which will continue to apply in ni will not apply in the rest of the uk when the withdrawal agreement was signed a joint committee of senior politicians from the eu and uk was set up so unsettled aspects of the deal could be resolved during the brexit transition period which ends at the end of this year at present northern ireland is supposed to adhere to some eu regulations after the brexit transition period ends on december 31 in a bid to stop a hard border on the island of ireland the pm says he 'd hoped the joint committee would find a way around this as he does n't want the eu to have any say over the uk after the transition period the uk 's chief negotiator david frost says the eu has refused to guarantee great britain third country status after this year but has said northern ireland is separate and would not require being listed as a third country serious consequences if uk overrides brexit agreement european parliament president warns mr frost says that under the northern ireland protocol if the uk is not granted third country status it would be automatically illegal for ni to import food products from gb the government says the internal markets bill is a safety net aimed at protecting northern ireland and would only be implemented if negotiations fail to reach an agreement why is the bill controversial by overriding the withdrawal agreement the uk would be reneging on an international treaty in doing so the uk would be breaching international law the government accepts this though northern ireland secretary brandon lewis said the law would only be broken in a very specific and limited way every living former prime minister brexit supporting tory mps and the eu have all expressed concerns over the plan david cameron said he has grave concerns about any plan that would see the uk break an international treaty obligation geoffrey cox who was mr johnson 's attorney general when the withdrawal agreement was signed said it would be unconscionable to override the brexit divorce deal the brexit supporting tory mp said there is no doubt the unpalatable implications of the withdrawal agreement were known when the prime minister signed it the eu has threatened to walk away from negotiations on a free trade deal if the eu does not back down on the internal markets bill by the end of the month dozens of mps are angry about the pm 's proposals not only because they would break international law if implemented but they could scupper all hopes of a free trade deal with the eu they also say it would reduce ability to sign trade deals with other countries as it would demonstrate that the uk can not be trusted on international treaties boris johnson tells tory mps brexit law breach necessary to stop a foreign power from breaking up uk can boris johnson be defeated it is also possible though improbable that the prime minister could be defeated on an amendment to the internal markets bill which is expected to be voted on next week senior tory sir bob neill chair of the commons justice committee said his amendment would impose a parliamentary lock on any changes to the withdrawal agreement among its supporters are former prime minister theresa may and damian green who was her deputy prime minister johnson held a conference call with around 250 backbench mps on friday in which he tried to convince them to back his proposal it has also been indicated that tories could have the whip removed if they rebel the debate this evening which the prime minister will open is scheduled to commence at 4.30pm on monday and a vote is expected at around 10 pm mr johnson will make the case to mps that it is critical that the legislation is passed before the end of the year so it can act as a safety net if no trade deal is agreed with brussels before the end of the year video report by itv news political correspondent paul brand boris johnson has defended his controversial plan to allow ministers to tear up the brexit divorce deal by suggesting the european union was being unreasonable and failing to negotiate in good faith in a commons debate ahead of a vote late on monday the prime minister urged mps to support the internal markets bill which would put the uk in breach of international law by breaking the terms of the treaty signed with brussels in order to guarantee the economic and political integrity of the united kingdom saying it was a safety net and an insurance policy the internal market bill sets out the way that trade within the uk will work once outside the eus single market and customs union if implemented the bill will end the legal legitimacy of the northern ireland protocol contained within the withdrawal agreement in areas such as customs and state aid and financial assistance it will ensure goods from northern ireland continue to have unfettered access to the uk market while making clear eu state aid a subsidy or any other aid provided by a government that distorts competitions rules which will continue to apply in ni will not apply in the rest of the uk watch as mps debate the controversial internal markets bill that could override brexit agreements in the commons as he sought to quell a growing tory revolt over the measures mr johnson claimed that passing the legislation would strengthen the hand of negotiators trying to strike a trade deal with the eu in an effort to reassure conservative mps mr johnson said the measures contained in the bill to set aside parts of the brexit deal were an insurance policy that he hoped would never be invoked if an agreement was reached with brussels and he promised that if it was necessary for the powers to be used mps would be given a vote on the regulations mr johnson has faced backlash from all five of the former living prime ministers and a growing number of tory mps have said they will rebel against the government and vote down the bill former chancellor sajid javid said moments before the opening of the second reading of the bill on monday afternoon that he wasregretfully unable to support the uk internal market bill unamended mr johnson taking the unusual step of opening the debate on the legislation in the commons accused the eu of going to extreme and unreasonable lengths over the northern ireland protocol which he said could lead to blockading food and agriculture transports within our own country the measures contained in the deal negotiated and championed by the prime minister last year were designed to prevent a hard border on the island of ireland by keeping northern ireland closely aligned with eu customs rules mr johnson told the commons the intention of this bill is clearly to stop any such use of the stick against this country and that s what it does its a protection its a safety net its an insurance policy and it is a very sensible measure and in a spirit of reasonableness we are conducting those checks in accordance with our obligations we are creating the sanitary and vito sanitary processes required under the protocol and spending hundreds of millions of pounds on helping traders he added now that we 've left the eu and the transition period is about to elapse we need the armature of our law once again to preserve the arrangements on which so many jobs and livelihoods depend that is the fundamental purpose of this bill which should be welcomed by everyone who cares about the sovereignty and integrity of our united kingdom shadow business secretary ed miliband said there are questions around the bill which go to the heart of who we are as a country mr miliband standing in for labour leader sir keir starmer who is self isolating after a family member showed symptoms of coronavirus said there are two questions at the heart of the bill and why why well be opposing it tonight first how do we get an internal market after january 1 within the uk while upholding the devolution settlements which have been a vital part of our constitution now for two decades and are essential for our union and secondly is our country going to abide by the rule of law a rules based international order for which we are famous around the world and have always stood up these are not small questions but go to the heart of who we are as a country and to the character of this government mr miliband said it was not an argument about leave vs remain but right vs wrong he told the commons our global reputation for rule making not rule breaking is one of the reasons we are so respected around the world and when you ask of people to think of britain they think of the rule of law and lets be clear after the prime ministers speech this is not an argument about remain vs leave it is an argument about right vs wrong he accused boris johnson of legislative hooliganism telling mps i do nt understand this he signed the deal its his deal it is the deal that he said would protect the people of northern ireland and i have to say to him this is not just legislative hooliganism on any issue it is on the most sensitive issues of all mr miliband challenged the prime minister to highlight the clause he says he 's worried about about gb to northern ireland exports the prime minister refused to answer after the shadow business secretary gave way to him he did n't read the protocol he has n't read the bill he does n't know his stuff mr miliband said referring to comments made last week by the northern ireland secretary brandon lewis admitted that the legislation would break international law in a very specific and limited way mr miliband said it now turns out that breaking the law in a specific and limited way is a reasonable defence for the government the johnson defence means something very specific there is one rule for the british public and another rule for this government he added for the first time in his life it is time to take responsibility it is time to fess up either he was nt straight with the country about the deal in the first place or he did nt understand it because a competent government would never have entered into a binding agreement with provisions it could not live with and if such a government somehow missed the point but woke up later it would have done what any competent business would do after it realised it ca nt live with the terms of a contract it would negotiate a way out in good faith mr miliband said and that s why this is all so unnecessary because there is a mechanism designed for exactly this purpose in the agreement the joint committee on the northern ireland protocol in the commons labour mp stephen doughty challenged the pm about how a member of his own party described his brexit policy as nixonian madman theory mr doughty said is he not deeply worried that his policies and approach are being compared to those of the disgraced former us president richard nixon rather than someone like winston churchill mr johnson replied that the bill is essential for guaranteeing the economic and political integrity of the united kingdom snp westminster leader ian blackford warned tory mps not to follow the prime minister by breaking the law he told the commons this is a test for the house this evening do not wait for the committee stage legally morally ethically the right thing to do is to vote down this bill tonight and this house must be accountable do not follow the prime minister in acquiescing in breaking the law because if you vote for second reading tonight that s exactly what you re all doing so this is a test and i understand the challenge that conservative members face do nt support the prime minister by breaking the law this evening it is as simple as that conservative sir bob neill added that he wants to be able to support the bill but can not support it as it stands he said i hope that we will take the opportunity to change and improve these clauses and the way in which they might operate so that we do not fall into a means of damaging our reputation that is why i ca nt support the bill tonight i hope that we will see amendments to change what i believe are egregious and needless and potentially damaging elements of part five of the bill unless there are those changes i would have further difficulty supporting the bill but i do having listened to what the prime minister has said want to give the government that chance in a constructive spirit and i know that michael gove is listening carefully to that he added we need to find a constructive means of making sure that we meet our obligations to the union but not undermining our obligations to the rule of law either i do not believe that is impossible with good will conservative charles walker told the commons i m no fan of the eu i was in every single division lobby for brexit i think they re a pain in the neck but surely we have to exhaust all other options before we press the nuclear button i m not going to be voting for this bill at second reading because if you keep whacking a dog do nt be surprised when it bites you back we are all members of parliament and we deserve to be taken seriously former conservative minister stephen hammond said the country does not break international law just because it does nt like the compromise it signed up to as he pressed mr gove about whether an amendment will be brought forward to enable mps to vote before powers in the bill can be used conservative former minister steve brine told the house he and the prime minister fell out last year over the prospect of a no deal brexit as he sought assurances that mr johnson still wants to secure a free trade agreement with the eu mr johnson replied its by passing this bill tonight and in subsequent days that we will make the possibility of that great free trade agreement more real and we will get it done sooner he claimed the bill will expedite such a trade deal with the eu and other countries last week following emergency talks the eu threatened to walk away from negotiations on a free trade deal if the government does not back down on the internal markets bill by the end of the month mps have criticised the pm 's proposals not only because they would break international law if implemented but they could scupper all hopes of a free trade deal with the eu they also say it would reduce ability to sign trade deals with other countries as it would demonstrate that the uk can not be trusted on international treaties the prime minister added the uk would also simultaneously pursue every possible redress under international law as provided for in the protocol with an arbitration panel sought if necessary mr johnson told the commons its not a question of if we meet our obligations but how we fulfil them we must do so in a way that satisfies the fundamental purpose of the protocol the belfast / good friday agreement and the constitutional position of northern ireland we will work with the eu on all of these issues and even if we have to use these powers we will continue to engage with the joint committee so that any dispute is resolved as quickly and as amicably as possible reconciling the integrity of the eus single market with northern irelands place in the uks customs territory but what we can not do now is tolerate a situation where our eu counterparts seriously believe that they have the power to break up our country if that is what mps want them to have on the other side then i m afraid they re grievously mistaken that illusion must be decently dispatched and that s why these reserve powers are enshrined in this bill he added last year we signed the withdrawal agreement in the belief which i still hold that the eu would be reasonable now after everything that has recently happened we must consider the alternative we ask for reasonableness and common sense and balance and we still hope to achieve that through the joint committee process in which we will always persevere no matter what the provocation despite the angry rhetoric from both sides in the post - brexit talks informal discussions on a future trade deal with the eu were due to continue this week with a meeting expected between chief negotiators lord frost and michel barnier and their teams due on tuesday mps are to expected to vote on the bill late on monday david cameron follows all other living ex - pms in

and political support as demonstrations against the extension of his 26-year rule entered a sixth week alexander lukashenkos talks with russian president vladimir putin in the black sea resort of sochi came a day after an estimated 150,000 people flooded the streets of the belarusian capital demanding his resignation the interior ministry said 774 people were arrested in minsk and other cities in belarus for holding unsanctioned rallies on sunday mr putin said russia will provide a 1.15bn loan to belarus and fulfil all its obligations under a union treaty between the neighbours speaking at the start of the talks he emphasised the belarusians themselves must settle the situation without any foreign meddling he commended mr lukashenko for his pledge to conduct a constitutional reform protesters in belarus have dismissed mr lukashenkos re - election for a sixth term in the august 9 vote as rigged belarus activist goes missing after mass anti - government protests tens of thousands protest in belarus as calls for lukashenko to resign continue the united states and the european union have criticised the election as neither free nor fair and urged the belarusian leader to engage in talks with the opposition a demand he rejected the opposition has dismissed mr lukashenkos talk about constitutional reform as an attempt to win time and assuage the protesters anger mr putin hailed it as a timely and reasonable move that would help reach a new level in the development of the political system in a bid to win moscows support the 66-year old former state farm director has tried to cast the protests as an effort by the west to isolate russia which sees the neighbour as a key bulwark against nato and a major conduit for energy exports to europe as he sat across the table from mr putin mr lukashenko pointed at natos drills near belarus borders and said the two countries must strengthen their defence ties mr putin emphasised that russian paratroopers who arrived in belarus for joint drills that began on monday will leave the country after the exercise kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters after the four hour talks that the leaders did not discuss the possibility of basing russian forces in belarus he also reiterated that moscow regards mr lukashenko as belarus legitimate president russia and belarus have a union treaty envisaging close political economic and military ties but they have often engaged in acrimonious disputes before the election mr lukashenko repeatedly accused the kremlin of pressing belarus to abandon its independence but with the us and the eu criticising the election as neither free nor fair and readying a package of sanctions mr lukashenko now has to rely squarely on russias support despite the frictions in the past the kremlin abhors the prospect of public protests forcing the resignation of the nations leader fearing it could embolden mr putins critics at home mr putin quickly congratulated mr lukashenko on his re - election and promised to send russian police to belarus if protests there turn violent noting that there is no need for that yet we see belarus as our closest ally and we will undoubtedly fulfil all our obligations the russian leader told mr lukashenko during mondays talks sviatlana tsikhanouskaya the main opposition challenger who moved to lithuania a day after the vote under pressure from the authorities warned mr putin any agreements he may reach with mr lukashenko will not stand i m very sorry that you have opted to have a dialogue with the dictator and not the belarusian people she said on monday any agreements signed with lukashenko who lacks legitimacy will be retracted by the new government pavel latushko a former culture minister and ambassador to france who was forced to leave belarus after joining the oppositions coordination council warned while the kremlin is standing by mr lukashenko now it may move later to engineer his departure lukashenko discredits himself each day and when he completely loses his authority it would be easier for moscow to replace him mr latushko said from poland the kremlin already has made a decision and is moving to fulfil a careful plan to have lukashenko removed alexander klaskousky an independent minsk based analyst said the kremlin realises a push for deeper integration between the two countries makes no sense now because of mr lukashenkos precarious position mr klaskousky predicted the kremlin might prod mr lukashenko to de - escalate the crackdown on protests while looking behind the scenes for a candidate to replace him massive protests are nt abating and the barbed wire water cannons and hundreds of detainees underline lukashenkos pitiful condition forcing the kremlin to start looking for an alternative mr klaskousky said putin would hardly want to put all eggs in one basket as belarusian authorities continue to target the opposition with pressure and arrests the united nations human rights council agreed to hold an urgent debate on belarus on friday western and latin american countries supported the motion while venezuela and the philippines sided with belarus african nations mostly abstained in a speech on monday un high commissioner for human rights michelle bachelet emphasised that all allegations of torture by the security forces should be documented and investigated german chancellor angela merkels spokesman steffen seibert strongly urged the belarusian authorities to stop using force against demonstrators release all political prisoners and start a dialogue with the opposition

which involves overriding the a key agreement signed last year by himself and the eu the ex - pm said he had grave misgivings about proposals to row back on some aspects of the withdrawal agreement following theresa may gordon brown tony blair and john major in attacking the plan itv news political correspondent paul brand discusses the controversial bill it means every living former leader prime minister has criticised the internal markets bill ahead of its second reading in the commons later today on the bill mr cameron said passing an act of parliament and going on to break an international treaty obligation should be the very last thing you contemplate an absolute last resort boris johnson tells tory mps brexit law breach necessary to stop a foreign power from breaking up uk so i have grave misgivings about what is being proposed he added however that the bill is being introduced as a contingency should negotiations with the eu fail to reach consensus on areas of contention such as the northern ireland protocol prime minister johnson is not only facing backlash from his predecessors but a growing number of tory mps have said they will rebel against the government and vote down the bill tory mp rehman chishti resigned as the pm 's special envoy for freedom of religion or belief over the bill on monday announcing his resignation in a tweet he said respecting rule of law & honouring ones word are dear to me mr johnson 's former attorney general geoffrey cox a brexiteer is the most senior mp to criticise the bill but he follows several other eurosceptics in saying it 's a bad idea mr cox said it would be unconscionable to override the brexit divorce deal adding how there 's no doubt the unpalatable implications of the withdrawal agreement were known when the prime minister signed it a time when mr cox was the chief law officer pm 's ex - attorney general attacks plan to override brexit deal buckland i will resign if ministers break law in unacceptable way former chancellor sajid javid has tweeted he would be regretfully unable to support the uk internal market bill unamended he added in a statement one of the uks greatest strengths and traditions is respect for the rule of law our long standing reputation for keeping our word has made us a more stable peaceful and prosperous nation breaking international law is a step that should never be taken lightly having carefully studied the uk internal market bill it is not clear to me why it is necessary to do so while i fully backed every measure necessary to get the withdrawal agreement negotiated and passed by parliament i can not support the uk pre - emptively reneging on that agreement i will therefore regretfully be unable to support the bill at its second reading and urge the government to amend it in the coming days he added the eu is certainly guilty in its negotiations of not treating the uk like the close partner we are if it does indeed act in bad faith by reneging on the withdrawal agreement then we should not only use the safeguards enshrined within that agreement but also reserve the right to respond in kind to affirm our sovereignty and union i m optimistic that both sides can still agree on a trade deal but even if we do have to walk away the uk will prosper the prime minister continues to have my full confidence and support as we deliver on our ambitious post - brexit agenda on friday mr johnson held a conference call with around 250 backbench mps to convince the likes of sir roger gale and sir bernard jenkin to back him when the bill is voted on in the commons a backlash began to brew among mps after northern ireland secretary brandon lewisadmitted the plan would breach international law in a very specific and limited way mr johnson told the mps the internal markets bill is a necessary way to protect the uk from eu influence after the transition period is over he told them clauses in the internal market bill are necessary to stop a foreign power from breaking up our country and insisted there are still hopes of a canada style trade deal on sunday former pm 's john major and tony blairunited to urge mps to reject the shaming

the proposals with current leader sir keir starmer and former leader ed miliband both labelling the move wrong he is making a mistake reneging on a treaty that will have reputational damage for the uk sir keir told lbc radio here we are on the world stage for the first time in many years on our own and what 's the first thing we do we break a treaty it 's basic stuff if you say to other nations we agree something and a few months later you say no we do n't the chances are they are n't going to trust you going forward mr miliband told itv news disagreement on the bill is not about remain or leave it 's about right or wrong serious consequences if uk overrides brexit agreement european parliament president warns he added why is it wrong because we are known as a country around the world for observing the rule of law how are we going to strike trade deals with other countries in the future if they think they ca n't trust our word it 's the wrong thing to do i never thought i 'd see a government and come along and say we 're going to disobey international law an agreement we signed the government should think again despite the growing disquiet about the bill mr johnson 's large commons majority means he should win an expected vote of the bills principles during the second reading on monday but if he does win the eu will be angry brexit pm insists uk is ready and will prosper mightily regardless of trade deal michael gove tells eu that uk would not and could not withdraw new brexit bill despite threatened legal action it has said it will walk away from free trade negotiations if the uk implements the bill meaning a no deal brexit would be the final outcome in a statement the eu said violating the terms of the withdrawal agreement would break international law undermine trust and put at risk the ongoing future relationship negotiations the eu did not accept the argument that the uk internal market bill was needed to protect the good friday agreement in fact it is of the view that it does the opposite the statement said vice president maros sefcovic called on the uk government to withdraw these measures from the draft bill in the shortest time possible and in any case by the end of the month he stated that by putting forward this bill the uk has seriously damaged trust between the eu and the uk it is now up to the uk government to re - establish that trust sir keir starmer is in self isolation after a member of his family showed signs of coronavirus symptoms a spokesperson has confirmed it means the labour leader will miss a key brexit debate on monday and could be forced to skip prime minister 's questions on wednesday the family member with covid-19 symptoms has been tested and sir keir must remain in isolation at least until the result is confirmed this morning keir starmer was advised to self isolate after a member of his household showed possible symptoms of the coronavirus a statement from his spokesperson said the member of his household has now had a test in line with nhs guidelines keir will self isolate while awaiting the results of the test and further advice from medical professionals sir keir who is n't showing symptoms himself was informed of the isolation advice after a studio interview on lbc in which he criticised boris johnson 's latest brexit proposal which will be debated in the house of commons on monday he urged mr johnson to reconsider the internal markets bill which will override aspects of the brexit withdrawal agreement which was signed by both the eu and uk in october he is making a mistake reneging on a treaty that will have reputational damage for the uk sir keir told lbc radio here we are on the world stage for the first time in many years on our own and what 's the first

david cameron follows all other living ex - pms in criticising boris johnson 's plan to override brexit deal how serious is tory mps ' unhappiness with boris johnson pm 's ex - attorney general attacks plan to override brexit deal buckland i will resign if ministers break law in unacceptable way i am being inundated with messages from people with what they fear may be covid-19 symptoms who can not work because they ca nt get a test so what is going on it is not all about the growing incidence of the virus though that is part of it here is what a source from nhs test and trace tells me demand for testing has gone through the roof its almost like the loo roll phenomenon early on the year we are doing more testing per head of population than other european countries but at current demand even once we have doubled that testing capacity which we will do by end oct we will still have the problem you describe concerns of growing epidemic as coronavirus r number rises above 1 across uk nhs test and trace shambolic whistleblower tells itv news they added hmg has made a fundamental choice to test all care home staff once a week which uses a huge amount of our testing capacity but i think that s right as that s where the biggest risk is we see a lot of people coming forward for testing who do nt have symptoms and just like every other bit of the nhs if we do nt manage that demand there is a problem or to put it another way if you want a test you will have to be patient but as i said last week this shortage of tests may lead schools and other institutions to shut temporarily if too many teachers and other staff are off work not really knowing if they are properly ill or not this testing shortage is a big problem ps i understand that 100,000 tests are being delivered to social care settings every day so that is two fifths of all testing capacity being absorbed to protect the elderly and vulnerable which most people would say makes sense but it means that with infections rising there may well be inadequate capacity for the rest of the population for weeks and months unless boris johnson 's derided moonshot of exponential expansion based on new technologies actually works why the pause in the oxford university coronavirus vaccine trial is actually good news coronavirus why young people hold the key in stopping a second spike in uk cases exclusive sage scientist tells peston coronavirus cases increasing exponentially having won that 80 seat majority for his party in december it is really quite an achievement by boris johnson that so many tory mps want to talk to me about whether he 'll stand down willingly or not next year there is even talk that letters are already sitting in graham brady 's bottom drawer calling for a leadership contest truthfully i do n't take the notion of an organised coup seriously but what should worry the pm and what the chief whip should be telling him is that many of those who were his enthusiastic supporters in last june 's leadership contest say things to me like everything that 's happening is on boris this is all about him he 's got till next year to turn this round david cameron follows all other living ex - pms in criticising boris johnson 's plan to override brexit deal boris johnson tells tory mps brexit law breach necessary to stop a foreign power from breaking up uk whereas there was a time when his mps ' concerns were focused on dominic cummings the point is that johnson 's influential and controversial aide is no longer his useful human shield when tory backbenchers moan today it is about the pm and johnson 's critics are not just the usual suspects or those who 've always mistrusted him or hate brexit or at least not just them like a deflating child 's paddling pool left out all summer confidence in the pm is hissing and spluttering away from him some of the carping will probably die down that said quite a lot has been going wrong in no particular order there is 1 the anxiety acutest in my experience among brexiters remainers gave up hope and therefore the capacity to feel anxiety some time ago that he is preparing to breach international law to fix a brexit withdrawal agreement that he lauded as great only a few months ago with the addition of cameron today every living pm has said he is doing wrong 2 a shortage of testing capacity that is threatening to see schools and other vital services closed as teachers and other workers are forced off work longer than necessary 3 fury that the rule of six means families ca n't have children on play dates and ca n't see all grandparents at once 4 deep concern that the handling of the covid-19 crisis has caused a deeper than necessary recession and acute hardship for many 5 worry that this recession will be compounded by a no deal end to the uk 's brexit transition none of which is to mention all the other cock ups of recent months what johnson would probably have dubbed in his journalistic days a fandango of fiasco encompassing the mutant exams algorithm the failure to protect care homes the ppe debacle and so on the important point is that for months tory mps gave johnson the benefit of the doubt on the basis that he has been dealt the hardest hand of any prime minister since probably neville chamberlain and we know how that turned out no longer even johnson 's fans are beginning to question whether his undoubted political skills are the prime ministerial ones required for this most challenging of ages boris johnsons former attorney general geoffrey cox has said it would be

impression they plan to permanently and unilaterally rewrite an international agreement the qc who was attorney general during the unlawful suspension of parliament said tariffs and customs procedures

then it would amount to the unilateral abrogation of the treaty obligations signed in october it is unconscionable that this country justly famous for its regard for the rule of law around the world should act in such a way he said mr cox urged ministers to use the clear and lawful options under the agreement to remedy their concerns that food imports may be blocked from britain to northern ireland or in extremis he said they could take temporary and proportionate measures during an independent arbitration process what ministers should not do however provoked or frustrated they may feel about an impasse in negotiations is to take or use powers permanently and unilaterally to rewrite portions of an international agreement into which this country freely entered just a few months ago he

to ensure everyone is rewarded fairly itv news correspondent paul brand discusses the problems with the bill boris johnson has said it is necessary to row back on aspects of a brexit agreement and in the process breach international law in order to stop a foreign power from breaking up our country the prime minister was briefing around 250 backbench tory mps after several expressed concern over his plan to implement the internal markets bill a piece of domestic legislation that would override parts of the withdrawal agreement relating to northern ireland northern ireland secretary brandon lewis admitted the plan would breach international law in a very specific and limited way sparking fury among dozens of mps in a bid to stop his own mps voting the bill down mr johnson urged them to understand his point of view he told them clauses in the internal market bill are necessary to stop a foreign power from breaking up our country and insisted there are still hopes of a canada style trade deal brexit pm insists uk is ready and will prosper mightily regardless of trade deal michael gove tells eu that uk would not and could not withdraw new brexit bill despite threatened legal action an amendment has been tabled to the bill for when it is introduced to the commons on monday and rebels believe around 20 - 30 mps will vote against the government in an early bid to avoid defeat mr johnson in a conference call told mps we must not go back to the miserable squabbling days of last autumn senior conservative backbencher sir bob neill who has tabled the amendment said he is surprised and very disappointed by the prime minister 's plan he told political correspondent paul brand there 's a lot of unease about the plan and a number of colleagues have expressed support for his amendment meps have said they will block any trade deal unless the uk backs down on the internal markets bill after the european union accused the uk of an extremely serious violation of international law a statement from the leaders in the european parliament and its uk co - ordination group said the european parliament will under no circumstances ratify any agreement between the eu and the uk if there is any law breach relating to the withdrawal agreement the uk has so far refused to do so with cabinet office minister michael gove telling a meeting with the eu that the uk government could not and would not change the legislation if the uk does not change its mind by the end of the month the eu says it will walk away from the negotiating table and abandon all hopes of a free trade deal it has also threatened the uk with legal action if it follows through with its plan will there be a trade deal with the eu britain 's chief negotiator david frost has said he will continue to fight for a deal but has warned a number of challenging areas remain before a consensus is reached adding how some divergence was significant the eus chief negotiator michel barnier said significant differences remain the uk is refusing to include indispensable guarantees of fair competition in our future agreement while requesting free access to our market he said talks will resume next week in brussels but after eight rounds of negotiations little progress has been made in a statement on friday a senior uk negotiating official said ultimately progress will be determined by whether we get more realism from them on the key areas of divergence both sides say a deal must be reached by mid - october in order for it to be put in place before the brexit transition period ends at the end of the year big points of contention include state aid fisheries and a level playing field a uk official said on fisheries their position is still a long a way from the huge change we need to get an agreement with around five weeks to go before the deadline it is hard to see how both sides will agree a deal on so many unresolved aspects why is the eu angry with the uk the uk is planning to implement the internal markets bill under which ministers would take powers relating to the customs arrangements in northern ireland after the current brexit transition period ends on december 31 the bill would override elements of the northern ireland protocol which is contained within the withdrawal agreement the protocol agreed after much difficult negotiation was intended to prevent the need for the return of a hard border with the republic while ensuring the integrity of the eu single market the government has said the measures in the bill are simply a legal safety net to enable it to protect the good friday agreement and the northern ireland peace process this drew a dismissive response from the eu which said that it does the opposite irelands europe minister thomas byrne said

the treasury select committee said on friday that chancellor rishi sunak may spark mass unemployment if the job retention scheme which covers the salaries of furloughed workers ends in october as planned the resolution foundations chief executive torsten bell said that the chancellor needed to reconsider plans to phase out support and called the committees report essential reading for treasury officials he added extending support for the hardest hit sectors of the economy will be essential to limit the rise in unemployment britain faces in the months ahead the government will also need to shelve plans to cut back universal credit payments to prevent millions of families from suffering a fresh income shock next spring mike cherry the chairman of the federation of small businesses said that policymakers should look closely at a potential successor to the job retention scheme the priority should be protecting viable small businesses and all the jobs they provide that have been disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus crisis including those caught by local lockdowns subject to continued national restrictions or with staff that have directly suffered because of covid he

staffs association general secretary manuel cortes said the mps ideas were practical steps to help retain jobs and protect the most vulnerable he added the prime minister said on wednesday that the

are to successfully beat this virus another union boss steve turner at unite said hundreds of thousands of workers could face a desperate future unless the prime minister and chancellor move swiftly to modify the job retention scheme surely it is far better to invest in jobs now than allowing unemployment to reach levels not seen since the 1930s and inevitably felt hardest in the least wealthy

condemnation on twitter which culminated in his resignation well i 've had better weekends and confirmed a police investigation is ongoing to discover who leaked the memo to the papers sir kim also

added i would never bet my own money on it he said too many factors the debates a potential vaccine economic recovery or any number of known unknowns could tip the race in trumps favour but he was most candid in addressing the remarkable admission by northern ireland secretary brandon lewis in the house of commons that britain could seek to break international law and rewrite part of the brexit agreement at one point the 40-year diplomat was so withering he got to the point of laughing at my astonishment to have the government minister saying yes we are going to break the law albeit in a very limited and specific specialist way is extraordinary he said i question by the way whether you can be a little bit illegal either you re on one side of the law or you re not saying its sort of ok because its very limited i mean really he went on to explain why it would prove so damaging for britain on the international stage if you do this which is effectively you do a deal you sign up to it its a formal international agreement and then you say six months later well there s a couple of bits about it i do nt like so i m going to unilaterally rewrite that why would anyone ever do a deal

play down coronavirus new book claims i just do nt see how you can say that and retain your credibility as a known negotiating partner with those you re going to negotiate with in future it is very

blame for the long distances some people are being asked to travel the government has been under pressure to improve its testing system after reports some people were being asked to travel 100 miles

what are the new rules on social gatherings in england the government 's testing system in england has been heavily criticised with labour calling it a fiasco on tuesday this week the health secretary pledged that no one would be instructed to drive more than 75 miles for a test labour 's shadow health secretary jonathan ashworth said it beggars belief that after weeks of encouraging people to have a test if feeling unwell ministers are seeking to blame people for simply doing what they were advised with children returning to school and thousands returning to the office it 's obvious extra testing capacity would be needed the fact ministers failed to plan is yet more staggering incompetence england 's deputy chief medical officer has told itv news political editor robert peston it is really important we take action now in order to combat a second wave of coronavirus her comments come just hours after boris johnson announced social gatherings will be restricted to six people from monday in the country speaking on itv 's peston show dr jenny harries compared the rates of coronavirus transmission in the uk to countries in europe she said our concerns are if you look abroad for example to france and spain about four weeks ago you can see the same patterns of transmission there and these are now starting to change through into hospital admissions and cases in other age groups than the elderly and the more vulnerable so it 's really important that we take action now dr harries added rule of six might be with us for months sparking christmas concerns what are the new rules on social gatherings in england when asked about how soon we would be able to gauge whether the government 's new restrictions on meeting people were working dr harries said the incubation period of the disease is up to about two weeks so a two week look at something an intervention and seeing how it 's working is always a good starting place she added but the data around testing and tracing is reviewed on a daily basis to see where cases are rising and you will have seen that in bolton for example quite rightly where there has been a very sudden increase in cases particular action has been taken with support of the local director of public health there itv news political editor robert peston has more dr jenny harries continued so i think we 'll be watching i think it will need a few weeks for us to see what is happening on a country basis and also for people to get used to these new rules as well and to really fit them into their daily lives as there has been an increase in people booking coronavirus tests the government has been under increasing pressure to improve its testing system after reports some people were being asked to travel 100 miles for a test earlier on

people struggling to being able to get tested she do recognise there are some people who have been offered tests in distant places and clearly that 's very disappointing what we want to do is ensure that colleagues in nhs test and trace continue to provide a service and we do want people to get tested dr harries continued the important thing is that those who have symptoms so whether it be a fever a new continuous cough or a loss of sense of taste or smell do apply online or by the testing number to have a test and that people who do n't have those symptoms only have tests when they are advised to do so by a clinician or by nhs test and trace exclusive sage scientist tells peston coronavirus cases increasing exponentially what was the governments biggest coronavirus mistake rise in

brexit agreement european parliament president warns the bill which will be tabled on wednesday afternoon is intended to ensure northern ireland can continue to enjoy unfettered access to markets in

tightly defined circumstances his admission led to conservative former prime minister theresa may warning the government was in danger of losing the trust of other countries that it would honour its international agreements while labour described the admission as absolutely astonishing sir keir starmer urged mr johnson not to reopen old wounds and to instead get a deal move on and concentrate on defeating coronavirus the row erupted as the pound plummeted against the us dollar amid fears that mr johnsons chances of securing a post - brexit free trade deal with the eu were diminishing it

england 's chief medical officer chris whitty said the new restrictions will last for a block of time but putting an exact time on it is very difficult he said people should not expect it to be a few weeks it will certainly be longer though restrictions will be reviewed constantly despite boris johnson recently saying he hopes for normality by christmas the time frame of restrictions means large festive family gatherings planned for december 25 could be cancelled he said it 's too early to say whether families will be allowed large gatherings at christmas but added he is hopeful that some

six people and covid secure places of worship which can house several groups so long as they are kept apart the new rules which take effect from monday only apply in england and include everyone in the country including young children i m sorry about that and i wish we did not have to take this step he added what you can and ca n't do under current coronavirus rules sir keir starmer attacks boris johnson at pmqs on coronavirus testing failures mr johnson insisted these new measures do not amount to a national lockdown rather the whole point of them is to avoid a second national lockdown the changes have been made to combat rising coronavirus rates in england with prevalence recently rising from 12.5 per 100,000 to around 19.7 per 100,000 the rise is mainly taking place among younger adults while school age children and the elderly are less affected the pm also said rules have been tightened for businesses such as pubs and restaurants which will now be required by law to collect test and trace data from everyone in a group and retain the details for 21 days there will be 1,000 fine for any premises that does not comply with the rules local authorities are to be supported by the government to enforce the rules at premises and will be able to rehire recently retired environmental health officers to help sports pilots which have been arranged for this weekend will be allowed to go ahead but will be limited to crowds of 1,000 and they will not take place in areas where cases are high stadium pilots planned for october such as a return for fans to premier league football will be reviewed in light of the rise of infection rates mr johnson also said late night restrictions forcing businesses to close from 10 pm to 5 am could become widespread if infection rates rise significantly in local areas this rule is already in place in bolton it will also become mandatory for anyone flying out of the country to fill in a covid form to provide journey and contact details at the airport and border force will be checking upon people required to quarantine upon their return police will also be able to shut down house parties containing more than six people breaching new rules on gatherings can be fined 100 however it will double for repeated offences up to 3,200 the prime minister said without a vaccine a mass testing programme is the only way people will be able to lead more normal lives mr johnson said in future in the near future we want to start using testing to identify people who are negative who do nt have coronavirus and who are not infectious so we can allow them to behave in a more normal way in the knowledge they can not infect anyone else with the virus mass testing with quickly returned results could allow theatres and sports venues could test all audience members on the day and let in those with a negative result all those who are not infectious workplaces could be opened up to all those who test negative that morning and allow them to behave in a way that was normal before covid those isolating because they are a contact or quarantining after travelling abroad could after a period be tested and released

says she frequently receives on social media the senior labour politician who was the first ever black female to be elected an mp also revealed she very regularly has to report violent threats to the police speaking on the itv news podcast acting prime minister ms abbott admitted she 's made mistakes during her 33 years in parliament but she said she feels she is punished for them much more than other mps the media and a lot of the people you see online are a little less forgiving of me mistakes from other mps would be shrugged off it becomes a big deal if it is me she told podcast presenter paul brand diane abbott apologises after drinking mojito on tfl train ms abbott shared what it was like to receive a barrage of online abuse after an interview in which she slipped up while speaking about police numbers it was very frightening to be at the eye of the storm she said ms abbott did a series of broadcast interviews about police numbers and did all of them without a slip however in one discussion she had trouble recalling some figures at first i thought oh well it was just a mistake but it just became this huge storm and wherever i went that day i was surrounded by cameras it was the most alarming and demoralising thing not least because it was one slip up in a whole series of interviews on the same subject she added what was frightening was the abuse and this theme that i was stupid that i was unfit to become a member of parliament it was just naked abuse scrutiny is one thing mps ought to expect that naked abuse is another ms abbott said the most upsetting abuse she finds is when it is aimed at her son it 's incredibly hurtful it 's much more hurtful than anything is written about me she said the hackney north and stoke newington mp who in recent years has become a target for internet trolls said she now chooses not to read most of the insults aimed at her because it would be so demoralising but her staff who keep an eye on her social media profile have been really shocked at what they 've seen we very regularly have to send stuff to the police because of threats of violence and other threats she said it was not for her to say she gets abused because she is black but said it is noticeable she receives more abuse than others in the podcast ms abbott also talks about the current labour leader keir starmer why she thinks labour lost the 2019 election

appeared to blame the recent rise in coronavirus cases on people who had not been following the government 's guidance mr johnson also faced several questions about his plans to amend the brexit withdrawal agreement yesterday the secretary of state for northern ireland brandon lewis admitted their plans to amend the agreement would be in breach of international law mr johnson said he expected everybody in this country to obey the law in a stormy set of questions from the snp leader in the house of commons ian blackford attacked the prime minister 's brexit plans and accused him of attempting to take power away from scotland mr blackford accused mr johnson of creating a rogue state and asked why does the prime minister think he and his friends are above the law after the prime minister said the new bill would protect the united kingdom mr blackford accused him of lying speaker lindsey hoyle intervened and the remark was eventually withdrawn labour mp siobhain mcdonagh asked the prime minister to condemn the treatment of the uighur muslims by the chinese government earlier ms mcdonagh sent a letter to the chinese ambassador which was co - signed by more than 130 mps and peers accusing china of a programme of ethnic cleansing against the uighurs the prime minister said she was right to address the issue and he would raise it at every available opportunity social gatherings of more than six people to be banned in england for forseeable future what are the new rules on social gatherings in england the question for boris johnson is why he signed a withdrawal agreement that gives the eu the power to decide whether agricultural products from great britain are fit for export to northern ireland there was no secret that this is in the withdrawal agreement it is there in black and white critics of the deal cited it from the start it is why more sanitary and phytosanitary concerning the health of plants checks will be required on livestock and agrifoods going from great britain to northern ireland so why would boris johnson sign a deal knowing from the outset that its terms were such that in plausible circumstances they might lead him to breach international law or was he unusual in simply not knowing as for the eus take an official says we still need to list the uk as country that can export agriculture stuff it would help if the uk could explain its future regime on food production standards hygiene etc somehow the uk says it will be equivalent to eu but we need details quite ps this from a former uk official i have been presuming that their inability to detail the proposed food standards regime is down to intense us pressure and the split in hmg as to whether to diverge radically from eu standards or not you can only avoid the

parliament has warned boris johnson there will be serious consequences if he follows through with his plan to override aspects of a key brexit agreement david sassoli said the european union fully expects the uk to honour the commitments which were signed up to last year when the uk and eu negotiated the withdrawal agreement especially with regard to citizens ' rights and northern ireland any attempts by the uk to undermine the agreement would have serious consequences he said mr sassoli said if the uk reneges on the agreement that it signed up to last year then trust and credibility will be lost he added in 114 days eu law will no longer apply in the uk time is not on our side and frankly i am deeply worried considering the lack of progress in the negotiations at this late stage the comments come amid proposals by the government to implement a domestic law the internal market bill which aims to ensure goods from northern ireland continue to have unfettered access to the uk market while making clear eu state aid rules which will continue to apply in northern ireland will not apply in the rest of the uk europe editor james mates gives the reaction in germany earlier northern ireland secretary brandon lewis admitted the uk would break international law if it follows through with the proposals mr lewis told mps it would be in a very specific and limited way adding there are clear precedents for the uk and other countries which need to consider their international obligations as circumstances change his labour counterpart louise haigh described the admission as absolutely astonishing and warned it would seriously undermine the uks authority on the international stage head of the uk 's legal department has quit overjohnson 's plan to backtrack on agreement mr lewis told mps the government is fully committed to implementing the withdrawal agreement and the northern ireland protocol but he added the uk is taking limited and reasonable steps to create a safety net to allow it to deliver on its commitments to the people of northern ireland and keep in line with the protocol should outstanding issues not be resolved in talks with the eu conservative sir bob neill chairman of the justice select committee later asked the secretary of state has said that he is committed and the government are committed to the rule of law does he recognise that adherence to the rule of law is not negotiable against that background will he assure us that nothing that is proposed in this legislation does or potentially might breach international legal obligations or international legal arrangements that we have entered into mr lewis replied i would say to sir bob that yes this breaks international law in a very specific and limited way we are taking the power to dis apply the eu concept of direct effect required by article 4 in a certain very tightly defined circumstances he added that there are clear precedents for the uk and indeed other countries needing to consider their international obligations as circumstances change tory former party leader iain duncan smith said the government was quite within its rights to revisit the withdrawal agreement earlier it was reported how the head of the uk 's legal department sir jonathan jones had quit over the proposals downing street confirmed that sir jonathan had resigned as permanent secretary of the government legal department but would not comment on the reason for the departure the prime minister 's official spokesman said i can confirm that he is stepping down and we would thank him for his

reassure future international partners that the uk can be trusted to abide by the legal obligations of the agreements it signs video report by itv news health correspondent emily morgan bolton has been placed under a strict localised lockdown after a very significant spike in coronavirus cases the health secretary has announced hospitality venues are being restricted to take away only matt hancock said and late night restrictions have been placed on businesses meaning all must close from 10 pm to 5 am it has also been made illegal for people to socialise with anyone outside their household after the government turned previous advice into law all changes take effect immediately the health secretary said stacey foster explains the latest from bolton mr hancock said the updates were being made to stem the spread of coronavirus following a very significant rise in cases in bolton related to young people attending pubs bolton is up to 120 cases per 100,000 of population the highest case rate in the country and i 'm publishing the data behind the decisions that we 've taken he told mps in the house of commons that just because we 've come through one peak it does not mean we can not see another one coming following a rise in coronavirus cases in the uk a second wave is coming who special envoy warns of uk covid surge sage scientist warns coronavirus cases increasing exponentially deputy chief medical officer rise in covid cases a great concern in a plea to residents of bolton the health secretary urged everyone particularly the young to obey the new rules i know social distancing can be hard and how it can be extra tough for students who will be starting university but please stick with it and play your part in getting this virus under control he added we 're asking you to take a step back at a time when we all just want to get on with our lives and what we love and back to normal but we need to take this crucial step to keep the virus at bay because as we 've seen elsewhere if we act early and control the virus then we can save lives last week bolton almost had its coronavirus restrictions lifted before the government was forced into a u - turn along with trafford the town was due to have restrictions on social gatherings removed but local leaders said cases were rising too quickly for any relaxation to take place at the time data for bolton showed the weekly incidence rate was at 66.6 per 100,000 since then it has almost doubled to 120 cases per 100,000 the number of coronavirus cases in the uk explained bolton is among several greater manchester towns which have been placed under local lockdown since the national lockdown was relaxed on june 23 the region 's mayor andy burnham has been angry with the government over what he says has been a lack of communication between local and national government when considering new restrictions after new rules were announced for bolton a spokesperson for the greater manchester combined authority revealed mr burnham and others were not consulted the spokesperson said this decision was taken by the government in consultation with bolton council neither the mayor nor the council leaders of the nine other boroughs in the city region were involved we recognise the serious situation in bolton and have offered any support they may need mr hancock said the uk must learn the lessons from spain america and france countries which may currently be experiencing a second wave of the virus by acting quickly to stop local outbreaks in a statement he said todays ons figures show that the weekly coronavirus deaths have dropped to their lowest number since mid - march and the latest daily number of recorded deaths is three however we have seen a concerning rise in the number of positive cases particularly among younger people and these figures serve as a salutary reminder that this virus is still very much with us and remains a threat mr hancock warned younger people that the long term effects can be terrible for those who get covid-19 he said the huge rise in cases in bolton is due to socialising by people in their 20s and 30s so it is critical that we maintain our collective commitment to controlling this disease and social distancing is the first line of defence while young people are less likely to die from this disease be in no doubt that they are still at risk mr hancock told the commons the long term effects can be terrible and of course they can infect others six months on many people are still suffering from chronic fatigue muscle pain and breathing difficulties previously fit and healthy people reduced to barely being able to function sir keir starmer has urged boris johnson to get on with negotiating a brexit deal so the uk can get back to fighting the coronavirus pandemic the labour leader said the pm is wrong to propose changing akey brexit agreement with the eu after a cabinet minister admitted a planned move to row back on aspects of the brexit withdrawal agreement would break international law the government will introduce the internal market bill on wednesday which aims to ensure goods from northern ireland continue to have unfettered access to the uk market while making clear eu state aid rules which will continue to apply in northern ireland will not apply in the rest of the uk minister admits uks proposals over eu brexit agreement could break international law peston boris johnson can not have no eu deal and a seamless uk what is the latest disruption to hit the brexit trade negotiations he criticised the plan to introduce new legislation over riding elements of the withdrawal agreement and suggested mr johnson could be using the proposal as a distraction the labour leader urged the government to concentrate on achieving a deal with the eu instead of reopening old arguments and said it would be a failure if a free trade agreement was n't reached get on negotiate get the deal that was promised sir keir told itv news adding if this ends up without a deal that will be a failure on the part of the government why fish could scupper any chance of a brexit deal he insisted negotiators have enough time to iron out any outstanding issues and come to a deal before the pm 's october 15 deadline he said the government needs to focus on winning a deal so it can get back to the more important issue of tackling coronavirus what we need to do is focus on what 's in the national interest and what 's in the national interest is getting a deal the prime minister promised a he would get a deal he needs to deliver on that promise i do n't think the issues that are outstanding ca n't be resolved so let 's get a deal move on and focus on what the public are concerned about which is defeating this pandemic he welcomed the pm 's october deadline and said he would not seek to extend it were he in mr johnson 's position sir keir who was previously a passionate remain supporter told political correspondent paul brand that he is not calling for a new eu referendum i do n't think there 's any need to extend the trade talks there 's no talks of extending them he said adding we 've left the eu there 's no question of a second referendum the leave / remain argument is over the labour leader while criticising the government 's response to the coronavirus pandemic urged the public to follow all the advice the penny seems to have belatedly dropped for boris johnson that he can have a no trade deal relationship with the european union what he calls an australian relationship and he can have northern ireland as a seamless member of the uks internal market but under the eu withdrawal agreement that he signed he can not have both because if we trade with the eu under wto terms there will be highly significant tariffs levied on uk trade with the eu and highly significant fiscal and regulatory differences between the uk and eu and the default position in the northern ireland protocol of the withdrawal agreement is that absent agreement to the contrary between the uk and eu all goods flowing from gb to ni are at risk of flowing across the ni border into the eu and therefore they would all be subject to tariffs at the border between gb and ni and goods flowing from gb to ni would be subject to verification that they are not designated as eu goods intended exclusively for the ni market this would be fracture of the uk in an economic sense so little wonder that the pm wants to prevent it except that his plan to legislate via the internal market and finance bills looks as though it breaches international law that fear is apparently why jonathan jones head of the governments legal department has quit today and if it is illegal presumably the house of lords will not hesitate to try and frustrate the legislation and anyway it is not clear the withdrawal agreement approved by parliament in this session can be amended before a new queens speech and the eu wo nt hesitate to enforce what it sees as the clear stipulations of the withdrawal agreement as a binding international treaty so this is one cake johnson may not be able to have and eat his choice is an australian relationship with the eu or a seamless uk but not both or perhaps there is a better way of looking at this johnsons negotiator lord frost seems persuaded that no trade deal with the eu is an excellent outcome but if he thinks that threat is a loaded slingshot pointed at michel barnier and the eus negotiators he may find they see the catapult as pointing at his boss and the uk minister admits uks proposals over eu brexit agreement could break international law what is the latest disruption to hit the brexit trade negotiations why the uk 's fishing industry could be the issue that scuppers a brexit deal with the eu the head of the uk 's legal department has quit over boris johnson 's plan to backtrack on already agreed parts of the brexit withdrawal agreement according to reports sir jonathan jones has resigned as permanent secretary of the government legal department the attorney general 's office has confirmed his resignation follows news earlier this week that the government was potentially plotting to row back on some northern irish aspects of the treaty the ft reports how two whitehall officials with knowledge of the situation revealed sir

override the northern ireland protocol contained within the withdrawal agreement and replace it with the internal markets bill downing street confirmed that sir jonathan jones has resigned but would not comment on the reason for the departure the prime minister 's official spokesman said i can confirm that he is stepping down and we would thank him for his years of hard service and wish him well for the future asked if sir jonathan signed off on the new brexit legislation the spokesman said it is for ministers to determine the legislation we do n't comment on the specific legal advice which ministers receive critics of the move to override the withdrawal agreement have said it would breach international law if the uk reneged on its agreement ursula von der leyen president of the eu commission said the withdrawal agreement is a prerequisite for any future partnership and suggested there will be no trade deal if the uk does not stick to its side of it ministers have claimed the uk is committed to implementing the withdrawal agreement but the new legislation is being planned to give legal clarity if there remains a few issues at the end of talks if implemented the internal markets bill would end the legal legitimacy of the withdrawal agreement in areas such as ni customs and state aid and financial assistance the pm 's spokesman said we are taking limited and reasonable steps to clarify specific elements of the northern ireland protocol in domestic law to remove any ambiguity and to ensure the government is always able to deliver on its commitments to the people of

on the assumption that subsequent agreements could be reached between us and the eu on the detail that is the entire purpose of the specialised joint committee and we continue to believe that that is possible but as a responsible government we can not allow businesses to not have certainty for january lord falconer labours shadow attorney general said there must be something very rotten about this government if sir jonathan has chosen to resign he added this resignation indicates that senior government lawyers think that the government are about to break the law the government is trashing the best of the uk we are a law abiding country and the government have some serious questions to answer the uk is calling on the eu to recognise the reality of its brexit stance within a very limited time frame or else it will walk away from talks britain 's chief negotiator has said david frost ahead of the eighth round of brexit talks demanded more realism from brussels saying the two sides can no longer afford to go over well trodden ground and with just five weeks before the deadline of october 15 lord frost said"its time for the eu to fully recognise the reality of the uk 's position if they ca nt do that in the very limited time we have left then we will be trading on terms like those the eu has with australia and we are ramping up our preparations for the end of the year he added housing secretary robert jenrick said a deal is still possible but said the eu now needs to stop being intransigent show flexibility and realism get that deal done if not he said then we 'll leave the transition period on the same terms as other developed countries like australia have and that 's still a good situation for the uk ahead of the crunch talks boris johnson told european leaders that

to reach an agreement in time we have now been talking for six months and can no longer afford to go over well trodden ground we need to see more realism from the eu about our status as an independent country he defended the uks position saying it derives from the fundamentals of being a sovereign state and called for the eu to fully recognise this reality if they ca nt do that in the very limited time we have left then we will be trading on terms like those the eu has with australia and we are ramping up our preparations for the end of the year lord frost added senior eu figures reacted angrily after it was reported the government was set to table new legislation which could override key elements of the withdrawal agreement that sealed the uks departure from the bloc in january the prime ministers official spokesman said the government was proposing limited clarifications to the law saying it would only be to ensure ministers can preserve the gains of the good friday agreement in the event of no deal the internal market bill to be tabled on wednesday will ensure goods from northern ireland continue to have unfettered access to the uk market while making clear eu state aid rules which will continue to apply in northern ireland will not apply in the rest of the uk in addition an amendment to the finance bill will give ministers the power to designate which goods going from great britain to northern ireland are considered at risk of entering the eu single market and are therefore liable to eu tariffs the prime ministers spokesman said discussions were continuing with the eu to resolve the outstanding issues relating to the northern ireland protocol intended to ensure there is no return of a hard border with the republic once the transition is over he said the legislative changes were a necessary safety net in the event that they were unable to come to an agreement but european commission president ursula von der leyen warned there could be no backtracking by the uk on its previous commitments if it wanted to reach a free trade agreement i trust the british government to implement the withdrawal agreement an obligation under international law and

minister is planning new legislation that would override state aid and northern ireland customs aspects of the withdrawal agreement the treaty that sealed britains exit from the eu in january in a move that could risk collapsing the trade talks ministers have claimed the uk is committed to implementing the withdrawal agreement but the new legislation is being planned to give legal clarity if there remains a few issues at the end of talks ursula von der leyen president of the eu commission said the withdrawal agreement is a prerequisite for any future partnership and suggested there will be no trade deal if the uk does not stick to its side of it in response to reports that some aspects of the agreement could be ignored ms von der leyen tweeted i trust the british government to implement the withdrawal agreement an obligation under international law & prerequisite for any future partnership peston the reason why boris johnson is jeopardising an eu free trade deal protocol on ireland / northern ireland is essential to protect peace and stability on the island & integrity of the single market it is being reported by the financial times that the new legislation named the internal market bill due to be published on wednesday will eliminate the legal force of the withdrawal agreement in areas including state aid and northern ireland customs the northern ireland protocol aims to avoid the introduction of a hard border on the island of ireland in the event that there is a no deal brexit as part of its terms the region is expected to continue to follow some eu rules after the transition period ends in 2021 to ensure there is no hard border a resolution some brexiteers were angry about when initially revealed a number 10 spokesman said the joint committee a group of eu and uk negotiators debating the remaining areas of contention in the withdrawal will continue to work at resolving outstanding issues with the northern ireland protocol however the spokesman said as a responsible government we can not allow the peace process or the uks internal market to inadvertently be compromised by unintended consequences of the protocol the spokesman added we are taking limited and reasonable steps to clarify specific elements of the northern ireland protocol in domestic law to remove any ambiguity and to ensure the government is always able to deliver on its commitments to the people of northern ireland these limited clarifications deliver on the commitments the government made in the general election manifesto which said we will ensure that northern irelands businesses and producers enjoy unfettered access to the rest of the uk and that in the implementation of our brexit deal we maintain and strengthen the integrity and smooth operation of our internal market the government says it is legislating to allow uk ministers to decide which goods from gb to ni are at risk of entering the eu if the joint committee has not reached agreement on them by january earlier a spokesman said as a responsible government we are considering fall back options in the event this is not achieved to ensure the communities of northern ireland are protected negotiations by the joint committee take place between chancellor of the duchy of lancaster michael gove and eu commission vice president maro efovi negotiations on a trade deal take place between uk chief negotiator david frost and his eu counterpart michel barnier environment secretary george eustice said the government remains committed to the withdrawal agreement and other arrangements contained within it but added how both sides recognised when it was signed that the deal had a few loose ends if there remains a few issues at the end of talks obviously we need to legislate to provide people with the legal certainty and clarity they need he said the minister while admitting that talks had been difficult said a deal was still possible but insisted in the absence of an agreement we will leave without fail the suggestion that ministers could possibly undermine an international treaty and use northern ireland as a bargaining chip has caused uproar among key figures in ireland and mainland europe ireland foreign minister simon coveney an influential player in the formation of the withdrawal agreement tweeted this would be a very unwise way to proceed shadow health secretary jonathan ashworth criticised boris johnson for shenanigans that are posing serious risks for the economy boris johnson promised us he told us he had an oven ready deal he said that s why we had a general election last year and indeed he won that general election he was given a great majority to deliver his oven ready deal shadow health secretary jonathan ashworth slams boris johnson ' shenanigans ' parliament endorsed the withdrawal agreement and endorsed the northern ireland arrangements that he proposed the consequence of these shenanigans is that he s pushing the country to a no deal scenario he said that the priority during a recession should be to protect jobs and livelihoods especially in a time when there are great fears for unemployment i think this is very very dangerous for the economy and puts jobs and livelihoods at risk he added shadow northern ireland secretary louise haigh said it beggars belief that the government is yet again playing a dangerous game in northern ireland and sacrificing our international standing at the altar of the prime ministers incompetence he is now saying apparently that he wants to unpick that having signed a treaty having signed a commitment with europe on that but also having told the british people in a general election he had an oven ready deal brexit leaving eu without a deal would be good outcome for uk says pm how fish could scupper a brexit deal with the eu brexit ' sticking points ' are fisheries and state aid raab says mr johnson also plans to give brussels a five week deadline to agree fresh trade terms or otherwise call for both sides to accept no deal and spend the rest of the year minimising the extent of the disruption from the fallout he is expected to say on monday that collapsing the trade talks should there be no agreement by the october 15 european council would still be a good outcome for the uk allowing the country to prosper mightily political correspondent paul brand believes the pm has set a hard deadline of october 15 and there is not point of negotiating beyond that he will make clear that the uk will not budge telling his counterparts in brussels the government can not and will not compromise on the fundamentals of what it means to be an independent country and will look to turn attention to preparing for no deal the prime minister is expected to say we are now entering the final phase of our negotiations with the eu the eu have been very clear about the timetable i am too there needs to be an agreement with our european friends by the time of the european council on october 15 if its going to be in force by the end of the year if we ca nt agree by then then i do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us and we should both accept that and move on a covid 24-hour pass could allow theatres to open in time for pantomime season the health secretary has said as he suggested affluent young people have helped propel the rise in coronavirus cases matt hancock implored young people to stick to social distancing measures as he said that under-25s particularly those aged 17 - 21 accounted for a large number of positive case describing a recent surge in cases as concerning there were a further 2,988 lab confirmed cases of coronavirus in the uk as of 9 am on sunday the largest daily figure since may. meanwhile the health secretary suggested that mass testing could see people given a 24-hour covid free pass to enable them to get back into theatres and sporting events where they may need to be in close contact coronavirus test and trace service defended amid cuts to contact tracers it completely reframes your life the people who have had coronavirus but are suffering long lasting effects speaking on lbc radio mr hancock set out more detail for mass testing plans mr hancock which could give someone a pass to know they are not infectious for at least 24 hours when asked about people getting back into theatres to go to pantomimes mr hancock added that is the hope that we hold out for the nation that we can get things going even if there is nt a vaccine that we can use mass testing so people can check whether they have the virus today if they do nt then they can go and do things even if it means being in close confinement we need to use the next design of tests which do nt require you to send the swab off to the lab and get the result back there s a new technology that were backing to get a test where you can have the turn around essentially on the spot and so you can imagine being able to go to something like the theatre or a sports event or to work and you have the test you get the result back and then they can go into the theatre that is what were working on that is the hope and i also hope that will allow us to have a merry christmas mr hancock described the rise in cases as concerning and urged young people to abide by social distancing rules as they could still have serious illness and could pass on disease to more vulnerable people including their grandparents the rise in the number of cases we have seen in the last few days is concerning he said it is concerning because we have seen a rise in cases in france in spain in some other countries across europe nobody wants to see a second wave here it just reinforces the point that people must follow the social distancing rules they are so important the rise in the number of cases we have seen over the last few days is largely among younger people under 25s especially between 17 and 21 and the message to all your younger listeners is that even though you are at lower risk of dying from covid if you re under 25 you can still have really serious symptoms and consequences long covid where people six months on are still ill is prevalent among younger people also that you can infect other people this argument that we have seen that some people come out with saying you do nt need to worry about a rise in cases because it is younger people and they do nt die firstly they can get very very ill and secondly it inevitably leads to older people catching it from them do nt infect your grandparents he added we will take action if people go to big social events that are completely inappropriate sadly in a time of coronavirus meanwhile mr hancock said the rise in coronavirus cases was not restricted to poorer areas he added over the summer we had particular problems in some of the areas that are most deprived actually the recent increase we have seen in the last few days is more broadly spread its actually among more affluent younger people where we have seen the rise environment secretary george eustice echoes matt hancock 's plea for young people to abide by social distancing rules you may wonder why on earth a tory government led by boris johnson the heirs to thatcher for goodness sake are sacrificing the prospect of a trade deal with the eu because they want the right to subsidise british industry if the tories and thatcher stood for anything it was rolling back the role of the state in the private sector well all that is stuff for the gcse history syllabus and turns out to be irrelevant to today 's politics because if the government of boris johnson has an ideology it is that of dominic cummings and his vote leave crew and cummings 's passionate conviction is that johnson 's government must have the discretion to invest without fetter in hi tech digital artificial intelligence and the full gamut of the so called fourth industrial revolution how so well here is the cummings / vote leave fundamental article of faith for this era:"countries that were late to industrialisation were owned / coerced by those early to it the same will happen to countries without trillion dollar tech companies over the next 20 years whole point of being in government for cummings and he would say for his vote leave team who work with him in downing street is to try to change what happens on these questions i am told this is a remarkable and important statement it wo n't escape you if you did an o level or gcse in history that the uk was one of those few nations early to the first industrial revolution which then did indeed own and coerce those that were late but more importantly it says that cummings and we have to assume his boss johnson too are obsessed about not being bossed around by the two superpowers that already have trillion dollar tech companies namely the us and china and james forsyth in the times elaborated on all this in his column on be honest it is moot whether there is any chance for the uk to catch up in this latest industrial revolution with china and america even if every penny of taxpayers ' money was devoted to backing tech innovation but it certainly matters that this government feels it is an imperative not to be fatalistic and to have a go all of which is the preamble to explaining why johnson and his eu negotiator lord frost are happy to blow up talks on a free trade deal with the eu on the altar of rejecting the eu 's insistence that any trade deal must be accompanied by the uk adopting the eu 's rules and constraints on subsidising industry by the uk adopting the eu 's state aid regime or in a worst case following rules that are similar to theirs now to be clear for all johnson 's rhetoric about how the uk could make a tremendous success of trading with the eu without any preferential terms or access the pm would rather have a deal and if johnson stands for anything it is for opportunistic pragmatism so maybe he will find a fudge to reassure the eu that his insistence that the uk must have discretion over state aid is not driving a coach and horses through the eu 's article of faith that any trade deal must include provisions such as those on state aid to prevent unfair competition maybe there is a bill he can construct which in the words of one former eu negotiator would represent a serious reputable legislated transparent state aid regime with predictable arms length governance where competitor firms can challenge decisions in the way they can challenge eu commission one" is there such legislation in planning in sight?provocatively almost the opposite is coming down the track the legislation due to be published by the government in the middle of this week the internal market bill is designed to enhance the uk 's state aid autonomy rather than constrain it the background is that downing street officials are convinced the eu withdrawal agreement the divorce terms between the uk and eu contains ambiguous provisions that in and of themselves would shackle cummings and johnson and their ambitions to use the resources of the state to invest in the private sector so the internal market bill has been drafted to clear up those ambiguities in british law in a unilateral way but here is why this is so inflammatory the act of contemplating such unilateral action to amend an international treaty the eu withdrawal agreement is seen in brussels and eu capitals as disrespectful illegal and a wilful attempt to sabotage the free trade negotiations none of which is to say that there will definitely be no free trade deal though no deal looks likely and one final point is very important to be clear there would be costs to an economy weakened by covid-19 of the uk going from its seamless frictionless trading relationship with the eu 's single market to a relationship in january without any kind of mitigating free trade deal and involving all manner of tax and regulatory friction that 's the view for example of the bank of england though its senior people have resisted making any public statements to that politically charged effect there would be a blow to our prosperity the view of cummings and johnson is that such a reduction in the actual and underlying growth of national income represents an investment in a more prosperous future if that is they acquire what they see as the precious freedom to direct state resources to the sectors and businesses on which our future success will hinge who knew that the logic of brexit would not only be a thatcherite economic nationalism but a kind of state activism that used to be thought of as socialism brexit leaving eu without a deal would be good outcome for uk says pm how fish could scupper a brexit deal with the eu brexit ' sticking points ' are fisheries and state aid raab says a conservative mp has been urged to apologise and is facing criticism from her own party after claiming scottish labour leader richard leonards accent is the reason why the labour party is nt doing well in scotland dehenna davison who represents bishop auckland tweeted watching @sophyridgesky and she is discussing why the labour party is nt doing well in scotland i think i ve got to the bottom of it the scottish labour leader has a broad lancashire accent facepalm emoji richard leonard responded to point out he is from yorkshire and stressed that scotland is his home he tweeted i came to study at stirling uni four decades ago scotland has been my home ever since and its a broad yorkshire accent as it happens marcus rashford criticises conservative mp for comments on child hunger snp mp hannah bardell said tory mp dehenna davison should apologise for this ill judged tweet which says far more about backwards tory attitudes than it does about scotland which is a welcoming country place of birth appears to be an obsession for the tories with their hostile migration policies but scotland has been built on people of all backgrounds making our country their home and it is all the better for it labours ailing fortunes have precisely nothing to do with richard leonards accent and absolutely everything to do with their decision to side with the tories on imposing brexit against scotlands will and denying the people of scotland a choice over our future brexit trade negotiations ' sticking point are fisheries and state aid foreign secretary dominic raab says conservative msps also took aim at ms davisons remark with dean lockhart saying mr leonards accent is irrelevant mr lockhart tweeted in fairness richard leonards accent is irrelevant what is relevant is that he leads a party in a poor third position in scottish politics and has continued to fail to stand up to the snp in their relentless push for separation a spokesperson for the scottish conservatives said this criticism is unacceptable it plays into the kind of divisive politics that the snp promote footballer marcus rashford has criticised a conservative mp for his comments on child hunger kevin hollinrake mp for thirsk and malton was praising the governments eat out to help out scheme when he replied to a comment saying where they can its a parents job to feed their children mr rashford explained that the comment could prevent families from asking for help i spoke to a mum living off three slices of bread a day says marcus rashford as he creates child food poverty taskforce i would urge you to talk to families before tweeting to this day i have nt met one parent who has nt wanted or felt the responsibility to feed their children mr rashford said put to the side that this comment came from an mp its comments like this that prevent people from speaking their truth and asking for help we need to start uplifting each other government u turns on children 's free summer meals after previously rejecting plea from marcus rashford mr hollinrake has not yet publicly replied to mr rashfords comment the manchester united and england striker was successful in campaigning for free school meal vouchers to be provided to pupils over the summer period he has now teamed up with aldi asda co - op deliveroo fareshare food foundation iceland kelloggs lidl sainsburys tesco and waitrose to form the child food poverty task force which is endorsing three national policy recommendations foreign secretary dominic raab said that brexit trade talks have come down to the two issues of state aid and fisheries which he said were not something we can just haggle away the cabinet minister said the uk was happy to sign up to the terms on state aid as ratified in the eus deal with canada but would not go further than that and he accused brussels of double standards in demanding more from britain than it had in past free trade deals he said we ve actually got the issues boiled down to two outstanding bones of contention there is a good deal there for the eu we d love to do that free trade agreement and if not well fall back on australian style rules i think this week is an important moment for the eu to really effectively recognise that those two point of principles are not something we can just haggle away they are the very reasons we are leaving the eu but we want a positive relationship and the arm of friendship and goodwill is extended it is up to the eu to decide whether they want to reciprocate mr raab said the uk was being asked to be treated fairly in the final stages of trade negotiations with the eu he told sky news sophy ridge on sunday programme i think it is there for the taking this week the negotiations are really important and all the uk is asking for is to be treated like any other country in free trade negotiations no other country would accept being bound by or controlled by the eus rules or indeed in their relations with any other country and indeed the eu would nt accept it in relation to us i think that s just a straightforward point of principle why the uk 's fishing industry could be the issue that scuppers a brexit deal with the eu how will brexit affect your travel plans to europe next year it follows an interview with the uks negotiator lord frost in which he said the government was preparing to leave without a deal leader of the liberal democrats sir ed davey accused the government of being reckless and risky in its approach to trade negotiations with the european union sir ed told sky news sophy ridge on sunday programme i do feel the government is being very reckless and risky we are in a recession now it was nt foreseen when brexit was first talked of and during the referendum and during the last election this recession due to covid some people say may be the worst and the deepest recession for 300 years and in that context the idea of a no deal brexit on top of the covid recession i think would be a disaster for peoples jobs for livelihoods for businesses up and down the country i thought it was very noticeable last week when businesses were saying the government has nt prepared the border properly whether it is a deal or no deal they are not ready what has this government being doing video report by itv political correspondent paul brand prompts for civil service bosses to get the vast majority of staff back into the office have been labelled virtue signalling by a union chief outgoing cabinet secretary sir mark sedwill in a letter seen by the pa news agency has written to the permanent secretaries of government departments calling on them to bring as much as 80 % of public sector staff back into the workplace sir mark in the note dated september 3 said the prime minister had asked to be personally involved in the back to work drive and wanted to see departmental figures on a weekly basis following cabinet agreement that increasing office numbers would be hugely beneficial for our workforce he wrote we are now strongly encouraging an increased workplace attendance through staff rota systems with our aim by the end of september to enable 80 % of staff to attend their usual workplace each week for example 20 % for five days 30 % for three days and 30 % for two days with the balance attending only occasionally for now but dave penman general secretary of the fda a union representing civil servants said such targets would be difficult to achieve he said office use in whitehall was already oversubscribed even before covid restrictions were introduced mr penman told itv news most offices for civil service staff are designed for more staff than they 've got desks for anyway so you 're trying to bring huge numbers of staff back to an environment which do n't have enough desks for them anyway in any event this is completely impractical he argued the civil service had worked effectively since the pandemic started dealing with the increased demand for universal credit and starting the furlough programme from the ground up all with staff being 95 % home based mr penman added it is quite clear from the letter that has been sent out this is really about virtue signalling to the private sector that has already moved on you re not telling me that the big

world war dead at an american military cemetery in france losers and suckers in 2018 the reported comments many of which were confirmed independently by the associated press shine a fresh light on mr

biden told reporters on friday that you know in your gut mr trumps comments if true are deplorable mr biden added i ve just never been as disappointed in my whole career with a leader that i ve worked with president or otherwise if the article is true and it appears to be based on other things he s said it is absolutely damning it is a disgrace he added that the president should humbly apologise to every gold star mother and father to every blue star family that he s denigrated who the heck does he think he is mr trump in the oval office said no apology was necessary because it was a fake story the us leader is alleged to have made the comments in november 2018 as he was set to visit the aisne marne american cemetery during a trip to france the white house said the visit was scrubbed because foggy weather made the helicopter trip from paris too risky and a 90-minute drive was deemed infeasible speaking on friday in the oval office mr trump denied ever uttering such comments it was a terrible thing that somebody could say the kind of things and especially to me cause i ve done more for the military than almost anybody else later in a press briefing mr trump suggested the source of the story was his former chief of staff retired marine general john kelly it could have been a guy like john kelly mr trump told reporters saying his former top aide was unable to handle the pressure

appointment has sparked a heated reaction in some quarters with critics saying he is well known for holding misogynistic and homophobic views as well as drawing attention to his scepticism on climate change speaking to times radio mrs thornberry said mr abbott should be disqualified from the role due to his history of offensive comments towards women lgbt+ people minority groups its been going back for such a long time that frankly i think it goes to the character of the man and i do nt think we should have this sort of character representing britain around the world ms thornberry said she continued he s just not the right person to advise the uk on trade policy he s never been involved in detailed trade negotiations he thinks that issues like climate change and workers rights are just not important and during the two years that he was prime minister of australia he was personally responsible for killing off australias car industry when he arrived there were 200,000 cars that were being made in australia and by the time he left the three companies had left ms thornberry added what we need to have surely on the board of trade is people who can negotiate carefully and in detail and diplomatically and tony abbott does not have that character mr abbott says he is looking forward to contributing his expertise in global commerce to help britain in his new role as adviser to the uk board of trade after prime minister boris johnson came out in support of the 62-year old mr abbott who led australia from 2013 - 15 said he was only too keen to help the uk and looked forward to helping facilitate trade deals between britain and other countries including australia a uk australia trade deal maximising the movement of goods services and people is clearly in the best interests of both our countries mr abbott said in a statement on twitter its important for the wider world that britain make the most of its post - brexit opportunities and i am proud to be playing a part my government finalised trade deals between australia and china japan and korea i m looking forward to bringing that expertise to bear as britain works towards mutually beneficial improvements with its major trading partners the appointment of mr abbott who has also said coronavirus restrictions should be lifted seems to have caused divisions even among his fellow board of trade appointees anne boden founder of the online only bank starling tweeted to say she was pleased to be advising the board of trade and said it was important that we have challenging voices speaking to ministers but the financial technology expert added that she supported diversity and so did this woman linking to a 2012 speech by another former australian prime minister julia gillard in which she accused mr abbott of being a misogynist in the countrys equivalent of the house of commons wales born ms gillard quoted the then leader of the opposition as having asked during a discussion what if men are by physiology or temperament more adapted to exercise authority or to issue command london born mr abbott who moved to australia with his family aged two also campaigned as an mp against australias

important role in helping britain make the case for free and fair trade across the uk and around the world shadow trade secretary emily thornberry however said mr abbott had no credentials for this role the senior labour figure said mr abbott had a history of offensive statements and argued the oxford university graduate had no experience of detailed trade negotiations and blamed him for killing off australias car industry tony abbott is therefore the wrong appointment on every level which begs the more important question of why on earth boris johnson and liz truss have given him the job said

gaps in preparations eight logistics organisations including the road haulage association rha have written to cabinet office minister michael gove to highlight fears the uk eu supply chain will be severely disrupted next year if issues are not resolved before brexit haulage bosses have called for an urgent meeting with cabinet ministers to discuss the issues but the prime minister sought to reassure them by insisting the uk is ready for any eventuality mr johnson said if the uk is given an australia style deal another way to say no deal then that is what we will achieve and we will prosper mightily one way or the other he added the eu could be sensible and give us a canada style solution which after all they 've given canada and i very much hope they will but we 're ready for

parents felt too anxious to send their child to school 20 % of school leaders said they had a pupil in their school who did not attend on the first day because they are self isolating following exposure to coronavirus the top three reasons reported by school leaders for the small percentage of pupils not attending school on the first day were pupils are quarantining following a trip abroad 57 per cent pupils are still away on holiday 50 per cent pupils are unwell non - coronavirus related 41 per cent just 83 % of schools surveyed received covid-19 home testing kits and 14 % did not despite a government pledge that they would be provided to all schools a survey by the naht on behalf of itv news revealed of the 849 respondents a majority were primary schools school leaders had said testing kits would be essential if schools were to identify outbreaks and implement mitigating measures such as requiring a 14 day isolation period for those with a positive test and their close contacts testing kits were only sent to schools in england on wednesday august 26 last week just days before they were due to reopen the government website says from 26 august all schools and fe providers will receive an initial supply of 10 home test kits paul whiteman nahts general secretary said despite the governments u turns and last minute changes schools have stuck to their task and their efforts have clearly given confidence to parents and families it has also been revealed in a government study that there were very few coronavirus infections at preschools and primary schools from june 1 to mid - july when some but not all young pupils were in school the study carried out by public health england found that where there was a positive case there were no additional infections within the household class bubble or wider education setting when tested the covid-19 surveillance in school kids skids study included two arms weekly nasal swabs for at least four weeks and blood sampling with nasal and throat swabs at the beginning early june and end of half term mid - july a total of 12,026 participants in 131 schools had 43,039 swabs taken the study concluded that coronavirus infection and transmission rates were low in preschool and primary schools under surveillance on the naht survey mr whiteman said it is a remarkable achievement that schools have been able to welcome back such a high majority of pupils obviously for some the anxiety of coronavirus means that they do not feel able to send their children to school schools will work compassionately with these families and they should not be shamed or fined which is why we are re - stating our appeal to the government to take the threat of fines off the table these figures show that its an unnecessary sanction prime minister boris johnson has defended former australian pm tony abbott amid significant pressure to block his appointment as a uk trade envoy mr abbott is being considered for the role of joint president of the relaunched board of trade but his potential appointment is being heavily criticised due to allegations of homophobia and misogyny campaign groups politicians and celebrities are urging the government to reconsider whether his appointment is appropriate asked during a visit to solihull about allegations the australian former prime minister is a sexist homophobic misogynist climate change denier mr johnson said he does n't agree with everything mr abbott may have said but added how he was elected by a liberal country i do n't obviously do n't agree with those sentiments at all but then i do n't agree with everyone who serves the government in an unpaid capacity on hundreds of boards across the country he added what i would say about tony abbott is this is a guy who was elected by the people of the great liberal democratic nation of australia it 's an amazing country it 's a freedom loving country it 's a liberal country there you go i think that speaks for itself the prime minister said the appointment had not yet been confirmed and an announcment would be made in due course earlier transport secretary grant shapps when asked about allegations against

was accused of misogyny by fellow former australian prime minister julia gillard labour has written to the government urging it not to appoint mr abbott to the role saying to do so would be completely unacceptable because of his offensive and outdated views in a letter to international trade secretary liz truss shadow women and equalities secretary marsha de cordova said tony abbotts offensive and outdated views on women are well known including characterising women as housewives who did the ironing and suggesting that uppermost in two female politicians qualities for office were their sex appeal his views on homosexuality including his admission that he feels threatened by the lgbt community and that most people do are both dangerous and divisive ms de cordova added this is yet another example of incompetence from this government and a failure to respect the diversity of our communities the labour party urges the government not to make this appointment and look instead for an expert with views on women and equalities that better reflect our british values health secretary matt hancock wearing an nhs badge with the lgbtq rainbow flag was questioned on sky news on thursday over the suitability of mr abbott who led his nation from 2013 until he was ousted by his own party in 2015 he said he does not believe that mr abbott is homophobic or misogynistic and when pressed added he s also an expert in trade ms de cordova said mr hancocks comments were deeply disturbing labour leader sir keir starmer has said he has real concerns about mr abbott adding if i was prime minister i would nt appoint him scotlands first minister nicola sturgeon said mr abbotts coronavirus views are deeply offensive and wrong and he is not fit to be a trade envoy critics have raised concerns at his

biden blames trump for fomenting division and violence gavin williamson proved himself to be an a individual and an a * secretary of state during the a level exams fiasco his cabinet colleague jacob rees mogg has claimed the leader of the house of commons defended the education secretary after labour took aim at him saying he had done an absolutely first class job under difficult circumstances mr williamson has repeatedly apologised to students after an algorithm unfairly downgraded hundreds of thousands of results before a u - turn was performed allowing pupils to use the scores their teachers had predicted for them but he has also repeatedly refused to resign over the debacle which saw him stand by the results for several days before he was forced to back down amid pressure from students headteachers and mps ofqual suggests williamson should accept blame for exams fiasco mr rees mogg claimed mr williamson 's decision to shift policy showed he is able to react to a situation quickly and put it right despite it taking him four days to change his mind the real success of governments is when there is a problem being able to put it right and that is what mr williamson did and for which he deserves the most enormous credit shadow commons leader valerie vaz said on tuesday mr williamson did n't apologise for the debacle all he said was he was deeply sorry that those who have borne the brunt have been students nothing about the mistake no mention that students had to demonstrate to be heard exams regulator ofqual has suggested mr williamson should accept his share of the blame for the exams fiasco gavin get gone angry students demand education secretary 's resignation the chair of ofqual roger taylor told the education committee on wednesday that the regulator accepts responsibility for creating the doomed algorithm but said the decision to use a standardisation formula was taken by the secretary of state he said ofqual knew about concerns that some students would have their scores downgraded but insisted mr williamson was fully informed he rejected any suggestion that the education secretary was not aware of issues with the standardisation formula but said ofqual accepted responsibility we kept the department for education fully informed about the work we were doing and the approach we intended to take to qualifications the risks and impact on results as they emerged however we are ultimately responsible for the decisions that fall to us as the regulator test and trace has worst week since launch with 30 % of close contacts missed scotland 's r number could be as high as 1.4 sturgeon says jacob rees mogg has played a snippet of rule britannia in the house of commons to celebrate the bbc reversing its decision about the last night of the proms the leader of the house of commons held his mobile phone close to the microphone near the despatch box and pressed play ensuring mps heard the words when britain first at heavens command speaker sir lindsay hoyle intervened to joke mr rees mogg had broken the values of the house and teased how dare he mr rees mogg replied i of course apologise for any offence i may have given the house but when britain first at heavens command arose from out the azure main this was the anthem of the land and guardian angels sang this strain rule britannia britannia rule the waves and britons never never never shall be slaves and let us hope the bbc will recognise the virtues of britannia in this land of hope and glory later in business questions labour mp kevin brennan quipped i was very disappointed with mr rees mogg 's little musical stunt with his mobile phone earlier on a clear case i thought of britannia waives the rules rule britannia and land of hope and glory will now be sung at the concert at the royal albert hall following weeks of debate the broadcaster previously announced the songs would feature only as instrumentals with reports over controversy due to their perceived historical links with colonialism and slavery prime minister boris johnson waded into the row describing concerns about the lyrics as"self recrimination and wetness the bbc has now confirmed that the songs will be sung at the proms by a select group of vocalists citing covid-19 restrictions as the initial reason for scrapping the lyrics a spokesperson for the bbc proms said the pandemic means a different proms this year and one of the consequences under covid-19 restrictions is we are not able to bring together massed voices for that reason we took the artistic decision not to sing rule britannia and land of hope and glory in the hall we have been looking hard at what else might be possible and we have a solution rule britannia and land of hope and glory to be sung at bbc proms both pieces will now include a select group of bbc singers this means the words will be sung in the hall and as we have always made clear audiences will be free to sing along at home while it ca nt be a full choir and we are unable to have audiences in the hall we are doing everything possible to make it special and want a last night truly to remember we hope everyone will welcome this solution we think the night itself will be a very special moment for the country and one that is much needed after a difficult period for everyone it will not be a usual last night but it will be a night not just to look forward to but to remember statues buildings and streets across the uk that commemorate the slave trade a tory mp has been subject to a shocking level of abuse online after posting a photograph of his evening meal on twitter west aberdeenshire and kincardine mp andrew bowie had hundreds of insults thrown at him after he shared an image of his fish and chips most of the comments criticised the size of the meal and the poor chip to fish ratio but harsher attacks came from twitter trolls who took aim at the mp 's political affiliation mr bowie suggested the comments show that social media could put people off getting into politics however few people expressed sympathy in responses to the tweet one social media user said the comments were utterly depressing but the majority took the opportunity to further attack the fish and chips criticising the meal another user said it really does nt matter what s your political persuasion this just is nt on the original tweet containing the photo was captioned spent the evening talking fish only one option for dinner replies were restricted on the post however many chose to retweet the mp with their comments mr bowie 33

from boltons covid-19 spike matt hancock has defended a plan to hand a senior trade role to former australian prime minister tony abbott despite concerns about his comments on women and homosexuality when questioned on sky news the health secretary said he does not think it 's true that mr abbott is homophobic or misogynistic and added he 's also an expert in trade mr abbott is in talks to become joint president of the relaunched board of trade but critics have raised numerous concerns over opinions he has voiced including his belief that coronavirus restrictions should be lifted mr abbott has

marriage equality asked if mr abbott is a fit and proper person to represent us on trade mr hancock avoided the question citing his role as health secretary but added i do know that mr abbott is very good and very experienced at trade he added it is clearly a very important decision that the prime minister and the trade secretary are across equalities minister liz truss when quizzed by itv news on the matter offered similar answers to mr hancock she said what i d say about tony abbott is he s a former pm of australia ms truss refused to answer whether she was comfortable working with mr abbott opposition mps were highly critical of mr hancock 's defence labour leader sir keir starmer told itv news he has real concerns about the potential appointment of mr abbott to the role sir keir added i do n't think he 's the right person for the job and if i was prime minister i would n't appoint him shadow minister peter kyle saying ministers do nt even pretend not to embrace bigots anymore labour mp marie rimmer added surely there s trade experts who are nt homophobic and misogynists britain deserves better than tony abbott representing us on the world stage australian finance minister praises donald trump 's prophets of doom ' speech australia pm scott morrison forced to apologise for taking holiday as bush fires rage israel folau contract ended after anti - gay social media post the cause of the latest spike of coronavirus cases in bolton points to why we need continued vigilance against covid-19 and why it would be highly surprising if we were not now set on an upward national trend because the locus of the bolton surge was some pubs and possibly one in particular and it may be connected to young people socialising after returning from higher risk holiday destinations this is an important phenomenon it means the outbreak is correlated with life in general returning to semi - normal rather than to specific cultural or localised factors the point is that the data shows that earlier summer surges in parts of the midlands and north west have been disproportionately manifested in asian communities or in specific factories but with children returning to schools some students returning to universities and some workers going back to workplaces there are now national changes rather than just local structural factors that will increase the rate of infection so the big covid-19 question is whether the uk is just two or three weeks behind the surge in cases we are seeing in france or spain or just possibly and unlike last time on a lower growth trajectory very recent history would obviously suggest that when it comes to coronavirus where france and spain lead the uk follows but there are a couple of reasons to be cautiously optimistic that in the so called second wave the uk trend may be nearer germanys lower rate rather than breaking records as pretty much the worst in europe the first reason stems from the structure of the economy the uks disproportionately large financial and business service industries in which home working is much easier and therefore still prevalent boris johnson may lament that more employees are returning to work places on the continent than here but perhaps our stay at home preference is depressing the viral surge in a utilitarian way second we may like to kvetch about bungled local lockdowns a system for tracing contacts of those tested that has struggled to hit optimal performance and repeated testing bottlenecks but france and spain have not been best in class when it comes to prophylactic action the row between marseilles and paris over appropriate action to combat a serious increase in cases in frances second city makes this weeks spat between manchester and westminster look tame increased protective measures were put in place in marseilles at rates of infection six times greater than what triggers local lockdown here so do nt assume that the the uks history of covid-19 bungling is baked in this government has spent an untold fortune on increasing testing capacity and establishing a system for locating those at risk of infection more is promised it wo nt have all been for nothing backlash over local lockdown lifting in greater manchester greater manchester leaders call for exit strategy to lift covid-19 restrictions payments for low paid self isolating in areas with high rates of covid-19 watch the full episode of the acting prime minister podcast with jeremy hunt it is inevitable that the government will increase taxes in order to pay for the huge cost of the coronavirus crisis jeremy hunt has told the itv news podcast acting prime minister the former health secretary said he 'd be surprised if they were raised in the near future but said he believes the autumn spending review may see a few signals from the chancellor that tax rises are going to have to come i think they are inevitable he told podcast host paul brand i think we will try very hard to make sure that wealthier people bear the brunt of those tax rises but i think we have to be honest we may not be able to just put the pain on the very highest earning because the revenue pace may just not be big enough the former cabinet minister who now chairs the health and social care committee also criticised the government 's response to the covid-19 pandemic jeremy hunt on inevitable tax rises he said boris johnson who mr hunt lost out to in the race to become conservative leader in july 2019 has made too many u turns during the coronavirus crisis but accepted scientific advice often changes during a pandemic on the number of u turns he said its obviously too high and its something that they need to sort out but i think we have a combination of two things that have led to this one of them is a new government and a new prime minster and a largely new cabinet and that means that many cabinet minsters are just reading themselves into their briefs the second thing is a pandemic which means that scientific advice changes there is a degree of risk judgments change much more quickly than in normal times he said a way to reduce the impact of the pandemic before a vaccine becomes available would be to introduce population testing which he said would involve testing the majority of the uk once a week he admitted it would be a very big ask to increase testing capacity to several million a week but said if it could be achieved it would alleviate the need for such stringent social distancing rules he suggested an intermediate step in which the government could test all teachers and nhs staff every week so people can be absolutely confident when they re using hospitals when they re sending their kids to school that they are coronavirus free zones jeremy hunt 's solution to social distancing he added ultimately that is the way that we can completely crack this virus in that period before we have a vaccine if you had population testing there s no reason why you theoretically would need to have social distancing you could pretty much carry on life as normal because you d just know that everyone you d mix with have been tested very very recently mr hunt also said the implementation of local lockdowns needs to be better managed after greater manchester councils publicly expressed concern about the lifting of restrictions in some areas there another u - turn was forced on wednesday when the government tried to lift restrictions in trafford and bolton despite coronavirus cases rising there the government eventually opted to keep the areas under lockdown but there was a public disagreement between local and national leaders mr hunt said it 's really important if there are differences of opinion that those debates happen behind closed doors and then the decision is announced and everyone sticks to it i think the trouble with one person in that position of responsibility saying we should do x and someone else saying we should do y is that it undermines public trust and so just in these very very exceptional times i think it 's really important that all those who are making these decisions work together and try and hold a common line

select committee has heard the chair of ofqual roger taylor told the education committee that the regulator accepts responsibility for creating the doomed algorithm that downgraded exam results but said the decision to use a standardisation formula was taken by the secretary of state he said he understands there is now a desire to attribute blame and accepted the implementation of that approach was entirely down to ofqual but added how the regulator worked in a much more collaborative way with the department for education than it usually would have due to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic itv news political correspondent romilly weeks has more mr taylor revealed to the committee that ofqual wanted the 2020 exams to go ahead in a socially distanced manner but was overruled by education secretary williamson who wanted grades to be awarded through a standardisation formula using teacher assessments he told mps that it was a fundamental mistake to believe ofqual 's algorithm for awarding grades would ever be acceptable to the public he admits ofqual knew some students would have their scores unfairly downgraded but said there was an agreement that standardisation was a good idea it was accepted that teacher 's assessments would vary across the country so the principle of moderating them was a sound one he said we knew however that there would be specific issues associated with this approach in particular statistical standardisation of this kind will inevitably result in a very small proportion of quite anomalous results that would need to be corrected by applying human judgement through an appeals process for example we were concerned about bright students in historically low attaining schools we identified that approximately 0.2 % of young peoples grades were affected by this but that it was not possible to determine in advance which cases warranted a change to grades a level u - turn what happens now for students and what about university places a mega mess btec students do n't know when they will receive exam results he rejected any suggestion that the education secretary was not aware of issues with the standardisation formula but said ofqual accepted responsibility kept the department for education fully informed about the work we were doing and the approach we intended to take to qualifications the risks and impact on results as they emerged however we are ultimately responsible for the decisions that fall to us as the regulator ofqual 's controversial algorithm for awarding calculated grades had appeared to boost private schools ' performance and led to many other a level students having their results downgraded following moderation but addressing the education select committee mr taylor insisted that the standardisation process reduced the advantage enjoyed by private schools he said that is why we felt it was fairer to use the standardisation process as a mechanism to ensure the greatest possible fairness in the circumstances we do acknowledge that the level of fairness achieved was not felt to be acceptable but it did improve the level of fairness tory mp robert halfon chairman of the committee summarised ofqual 's defence of the exam chaos as not me guv he questioned why ofqual did not use the time between receiving schools ' grades in june and results day in august to test the algorithm rather than wait until the eleventh hour to realise the algorithm produced discrepancies mr halfon said perhaps some of the wild anomalies that sixth form colleges saw surely would have become apparent much sooner disadvantaged pupils will find it impossible to catch up unless 2021 exams change neu warns coronavirus students return to classrooms as unions call for pause on school absence fines in essence what i am asking is should you have done your own mock exam in terms of the algorithm responding to the concerns dr michelle meadows executive director for strategy risk and research at ofqual told mps we tested the model thoroughly we were confident that the model that we chose was the most accurate overall and the most accurate for those different groups of students mr taylor added that the risks with the model were raised with the department for education dfe throughout the process sally collier resigned from her role as head of ofqual last week while the dfe announced that permanent secretary jonathan slater would be standing down a day later schools minister nick gibb said on tuesday that there would be a decision very soon on whether the next exams would start late to allow for more teaching time during the disruption mr williamson on tuesday apologised once again to students who suffered a great deal of stress and uncertainty due to inconsistent and unfair a level outcomes from ofquals algorithm the education secretary told mps the government is determined that exams will go ahead in 2021 adding they were working with the sector to ensure this is done as smoothly as possible gavin get gone angry students demand education secretary 's resignation boris johnson has taken a bruising at pmqs with sir keir starmer attacking the prime minister for a crisis littered coronavirus pandemic which he said has seen the government perform 12 u turns in the first pmqs since mps returned to parliament after over a month away sir keir said it had been a wasted summer which the government should spent preparing for the autumn and winter instead they 've lurched from crisis to crisis u - turn to u - turn to correct one error even two might make sense but when the government 's notched up 12 u turns and rising the only conclusion is serial incompetence that serial incompetence is holding britain back sir keir said as he asked mr johnson to accept responsibility for the government 's errors itv news political correspondent romilly weeks has a round up from a fiery pmqs pointing to the most embarrassing u - turn sir keir asked the pm when he first knew about problems with the algorithm that resulted in the a levels exams fiasco mr johnson appeared to avoid answering the question and instead highlighted the stress pupils and parents have undergone before noting exams could not take place due to the covid-19 pandemic he went on as a result of what we learned about the tests the results that had come in we did institute a change we did act the students the pupils of this country now do have their grades and i really ask sir keir whether he will join me in congratulating those pupils on their hard work and whether he agrees with me that they deserve the grades they 've got when pressed again for an answer mr johnson said ofqual made it absolutely clear time and again that in their view the system that was in place was robust ofqual is an independent organisation and credit had to be given to their views mr johnson was accused by sir keir of being just tin eared and making it up as he goes along he added he 's fooling nobody even his own mps have run out of patience raab tight lipped over greece quarantines in england as wales and scotland act how many u turns before the government heads in the right direction pm warns turbulence is ahead but insists covid plan not blown off course it 's a fundamental issue of competence god knows what 's going on there 's no grip sir keir said the prime minister 's own mps have run out of patience following criticism from tory backbenchers which saw one describe events as a mega - disaster from one day to the next mr johnson dubbed his opposite number captain hindsight following the exam results fiasco saying he was leaping on a bandwagon opposing a policy that he supported two weeks ago but the labour leader responding during prime minister 's questions in the commons said the problem is he 's governing in hindsight that 's why he 's making so many mistakes mr johnson was chastised during the exchanges by the speaker sir lindsay hoyle who urged him to try and answer the questions being put to the prime minister boris johnson will face the wrath of mps when he returns to the commons on wednesday after the pm presided over a series of u turns recent weeks are thought to have soured conservative backbench opinion towards the government 's handling of the coronavirus pandemic he will face critics from both sides of the house on wednesday during his first prime ministers questions since parliaments summer recess began on july 22 coronavirus boris johnson warns turbulence is ahead but insists covid plan not blown off course as mps started returning mr johnson insisted his government has not been blown off course by covid-19 but acknowledged that sometimes it is necessary to change direction in response to the facts as they change his defence came as a series of policy u turns increasingly angered backbench conservative mps with one describing events as a mega - disaster from one day to the next questions remain over whether a level and gcse exams will be delayed next year amid continued disruption and whether portugal and greece will be added to englands quarantine list pressure on uk government over greece quarantine as wales and scotland act on tuesday mr johnson told ministers that in the last few months they have been sailing into the teeth of a gale no question when chairing his first cabinet meeting after the return he said and i am no great nautical expert but sometimes it is necessary to tack here and there in response to the facts as they change in response to the winds change but we have been going steadily in the direction in the course we set out and we have not been blown off that course he said there would still be some turbulence ahead and that things would be difficult on the economic front while the need remained to get this disease absolutely out of our systems many tory backbenchers are frustrated by the governments handling of the crisis with one senior conservative mp telling the pa news agency his colleagues are tired of the u turns he said there is an element of calamity and that there are tories from marginal and so called red wall seats that were won in the last election from labour who are getting jittery we d like to be in a government that has the impression of being competent rather than lurching from one issue to another and then after a short time doing a u - turn he added sir geoffrey clifton brown treasurer of the 1922 committee of tory mps said the panels executives expect to meet mr johnson in the near future to relay the concerns of backbenchers defence secretary ben wallace apologises after breaching social distancing rules to shake hands labour and conservatives tied in latest poll he told pa i think there is a lot of sympathy among conservative mps for the fact it has been unprecedented but then i think we must nt make other own goals we may have a big majority but that still does nt mean to say that we should nt be as competent as possible as a government the inferential committee of backbenchers is due to meet on wednesday but the prime minister was not expected to address them how many u turns before the government heads in the right direction england is facing pressure to reconsider quarantine rules for greece after scotland and wales introduced new measures over concerns about rising coronavirus cases the scottish government announced on tuesday evening that travellers from greece would have to self isolate for 14 days from thursday while wales also began asking arrivals from the island of zante to begin the period of quarantine the department for transport said no change to its rules for england had been made but wales health minister vaughan gething said he would be pressing boris johnson 's government for an urgent meeting to consider the potential risk in greece foreign secretary dominic raab gave nothing away when he was asked whether england would be joining wales and scotland in removing wales from the list of safe countries he said we respect the devolved administrations in what they do of course we here in whitehall look very carefully at all the evidence based on the scientific advice and we review the travel advice and the quarantine measures very carefully and regularly scotland adds greece to quarantine list heres what it means for holidaymakers coronavirus full list of holidays from england exempt from quarantine on return greece added to scotland quarantine list while zante to cardiff flight travellers must self isolate the move came as holidaymakers scrambled to return from portugal amid growing concerns restrictions could be reimposed to arrivals from there restrictions for greece were lifted in england in july when international exemptions were first permitted there were 14.0 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in greece in the seven days to august 31 down from 14.9 a week earlier a seven day rate of 20 is the threshold above which the uk government considers triggering quarantine conditions but greeces tourism minister harry theoharis said the country has a much lower number of infections compared to most other countries in europe he told bbc radio 4s today programme were actually in the right direction were going down in terms of the average numbers he added were taking specific targeted measures where we see specific concentrations of cases measures that have been successful and have been working in the past few days were doing everything in our power to ensure that every person that comes from the uk is kept safe in greece but scottish justice secretary humza yousaf announcing the restriction said the importations of new cases from greece is a significant risk to public health he said regular discussions continue with the other three uk governments over restrictions in wales mr gething said six clusters amounting to more than 30 cases of covid-19 in the last week had come from four flights two of which landed in england there are concerns from our public health teams that the current advice and control measures for returning travellers are insufficient he said he said that all

on their return tour operator tui later said it would no longer be offering holidays to the resort of laganas on zante from thursday the joint biosecurity centre was yet to change the risk rating for

continuing to consult with the exams regulator on whether or not to delay next year 's a level and gcse results the education secretary has confirmed in a statement to the commons gavin williamson said ofqual has been looking into the idea after warnings about a loss of education for millions of pupils caused by the coronavirus crisis his comments come as students throughout england return to school this week many for the first time in more than five months labour has been calling for a delay to exams saying pupils entering year 11 and 13 who have lost up to six months of teaching time face a mountain to climb unless the timetable is changed despite labour taking credit for the idea mr williamson claimed it has been being considered by the government since june this is something that we highlighted that we 'd be doing mr williamson told mps in a statement to the commons but he said labour did not support the idea when ofqual did a public consultation about potentially moving the exam dates back on july 2 students return to classrooms as unions call for pause on school absence fines i 've been to check as to whether the labour party made a submission as to whether they supported this the labour party did not make a submission supporting the idea of moving exams back so i very much welcome the labour party to our position mr williamson appeared to welcome a suggestion from tory mp bob blackman that school days could be extended by 30 minutes to allow extra teaching time for those who have missed out responding to mr blackman the education secretary said as part of the advice that was worked up along with the education endowment foundation one of their key recommendations was looking at how you can extend the school day how you can look at provisional weekends in order to support children who really do need that little bit of extra help in order for them to have a real impact in terms of their educational attainment all of these measures can have an enormously positive effect and that 's why we developed a 1 billion covid catch up fund because schools then have the ability to take such action mr williamson 's appearance in the commons was the first since mps broke for summer recess a period which was littered with government u turns delay next years a levels and gcses says labour struggling parents forced to make sacrifices in order to afford school uniforms among a handful of policy shifts was the a levels results u - turn which saw hundreds of thousands of students have their scores downgraded and then for them to be reverted back to teachers ' predicted grades the education secretary said he is deeply sorry about what happened this situation has i know caused a great deal of stress and uncertainty and i am deeply sorry that those who have borne the brunt of it have been students themselves i can only apologise to them again for this he said nick gibb the schools minister earlier confirmed to itv news that the government has been considering whether to delay the exams period so next year 's pupils have the same chance at success as previous years in mid - june we wrote to ofqual asking them to look into this very issue and how we can free up teaching time from the assessment process next summer he said so they are looking we have been looking over the last few weeks into the prospect into delaying the exam period there are a range of issues to consider the marking time the results dates the effect that has on university admissions and also the term dates of the other nations in the uk that use gcses and a levels his comments follow calls from labour for a delay to next years exams dr mary bousted the joint general secretary of the neu told itv news that disadvantaged children who have not had access to the internet or laptops or tutoring during the coronavirus crisis will find it almost impossible to catch up through no fault of their own she said her union is concerned that the education attainment gap between the more advantaged pupils and less advantaged pupils will be wider unless gcses and a levels are altered to reflect that reality mr gibb said ministers are working with exams regulator ofqual to get a decision on whether to delay next year 's exams as soon as we possibly can but he could not confirm whether a decision would be made before christmas asked if there will be an answer by the festive period mr gibb said i absolutely would have said so we need to make sure we come to a decision as soon as we can but it has to be the right decision and it has to take into account the other nations in the uk that use gcses and a levels it has to take into account marking time and results date and the effect that has on entry to universities there is still turbulence ahead for the uk in its battle with covid-19 the prime minister has warned but he insisted the government has not been blown off course in its plan to tackle the virus boris johnson conceded that u turns have been made during the pandemic but said sometimes it is necessary to change direction in response to the facts as they change mr johnson told ministers at a socially distanced cabinet meeting that in the last few months they have been sailing into the teeth of a gale no question and i am no great nautical expert but sometimes it is necessary to tack here and there in response to the facts as they change in response to the winds change but we have been going steadily in the direction in the course we set out and we have not been blown off that course the prime minister suggested there is now cause for optimism saying he is absolutely confident that the uk can deal with any future outbreaks of the deadly virus next year 's a level and gcse exams could be delayed schools minister says tory mp arrested on suspicion of rape will not attend the house of commons while on bail bit by bit this incredible country is getting back on his feet and recovering from this crisis the pm told his ministers during a socially distanced cabinet meeting on tuesday and we in this government are committed to do absolutely everything in our power to help he added he said there would still be some turbulence ahead and that things would be difficult on the economic front while the need remained to get this disease absolutely out of our systems but i am absolutely confident that if we continue in the way that we have that there will be calmer days brighter days and calmer seas ahead of us so thank you all very much for everything that you have done mr johnson said the uk 's workforce is returning to the office in huge numbers including his cabinet which met for the in person meeting at the foreign office asked later what the prime minister meant by huge numbers his official spokesperson said it was too early to share the data on how many people nationally had gone back to work it was the first time the cabinet has met since parliament broke for summer recess during which the government was forced to perform a series of embarrassing u turns possibly the most damaging u - turn was the a levels exams fiasco which saw hundreds of thousands of students have their results downgraded before a shift in policy allowed them to use the grades their teachers had predicted for them also on tuesday education secretary gavin williamson updated the commons on

concerns about their ability to reopen safely it will be the first time many pupils in england have stepped into a classroom since march when schools were closed except to look after vulnerable children and those of key workers the prime minister had attempted to have primary schools reopen before the summer holidays but was forced into another u - turn after many concerned parents said they would not send their children back until it was safer mr johnson is facing pressure from backbench mps who want him to avoid any further u turns a senior conservative mp said backbenchers were tired of the u turns there s that element of calamity and frankly there are people from the red wall seats who are getting jittery but not only red wall seats but other people who have nt got marginal seats

refused deny or confirm reports that the government is considering increasing taxes by up to 20 billion in order to deal with the cost of the coronavirus crisis ministers are looking at raising

or will not do mr barclay told times radio and particularly on tax measures ahead of that that s for the chancellor the budget and particularly on tax measures ahead of that that s for the chancellor the budget there is always four moving parts to this the key objective within the treasury is to get growth there is then a balance between the other three moving parts of debt of spending spending feeding into that and tax and what s your trade off then between your spending measures and your tax measures the real objective is to reduce the economic scarring from covid the money could be clawed back from pensions businesses the wealthy and foreign aid the sunday times said chancellor rishi sunak is considering hiking corporation tax from 19 % to 24 % in order to boost revenue by 12 billion next year the report indicated capital gains tax might also be paid at the same rate as income tax under the ideas being looked at pension tax relief could be slashed under measures being considered by the treasury to help pay for the covid-19 crisis the sunday telegraph reported the newspaper also said that raising fuel and other duties was also being looked at a revamp of the inheritance tax system and the introduction of an online sales tax was also being considered the international development budget could also be caught up in treasury reappraisals due to the cost of the pandemic it was claimed the aid budget has already been cut by 2.9 billion from 15.8 billion this year due to the contraction in the economy caused by the covid-19 outbreak however the government insists it still meets its obligation to provide 0.7 % of gross national income gni to international development treasury sources told the pa news agency that they do not comment on what may or may not be in the upcoming budget former cabinet minister damian green who served as then prime minister theresa mays de facto deputy said he was wary about any changes to the so called pensions triple lock the lock means the state pension increases each year in line with either wages inflation or 2.5 % depending on which of the three figures is highest mr green told times radio i would be very wary of the government going down that route it was a manifesto commitment to keep it i think this raft of things feels like a standard pre - budget treasury kite flying to see what people will make of this clearly the chancellor faces some unpalatable options because he s rightly spent many many billions of pounds supporting the economy and individual workers over the past few months the other one on that list that i particularly wince at is the thought of breaking the commitment on foreign aid i m proud of the fact that britain is one of the few countries that meets its commitment to have a small part 0.7 % of our gdp spent on foreign aid and i would certainly want to see that continued the government has admitted to paying social media influencers and reality tv stars to promote the nhs test and trace system as it failed to reach its 80 % target for the ninth week in a row a spokesman said the government had a responsibility to use every means possible to keep the public informed during the pandemic he said our use of social media influencers has meant over 7 million people have been reached this is just one part of a wider campaign utilising tv radio social print and other advertisements to ensure the public has the information it needs it comes as the sunday mirror reported love island stars shaughna phillips chris hughes and josh denzel were among those paid by the cabinet office to tell their online followers testing for covid-19 was free quick and vital to stop the spread second attempt for coronavirus contact tracing app underway on the isle of wight and in

expert as saying the stars would usually command between 5,000 and 10,000 for an ad post the governments spokesman said all costs involved in the campaign will be published as part of the regular transparency reports on gov.uk the celebrities could also face an investigation by the advertising standards agency after not initially labelling their posts as advertisements the governments spokesman indicated the cabinet office had been clear about labelling such content correctly and noted all three posts had now been marked as ads it comes after recent data showed three quarters of

when they will receive exam results watch itv news political reporter shehab khan explain the guidance teaching unions have criticised the government for the last minute nature of its latest coronavirus guidance for schools in local lockdown areas released just days before pupils are set to return to classrooms their voices join those of education leaders and politicians with the timing branded as reprehensible by some and others demanding more funding be put in place too the national education union neu said the guidance should have been received months ago describing the nature of the decision making as simply unacceptable coronavirus guidance explained for schools in local lockdown areas schools to receive just 10 coronavirus home testing kits and only small amount of ppe what is the guidance the government has announced a rota system limiting the number of pupils going to secondary schools at any one time as a potential measure for local lockdown zones while teachers and students may need to wear face coverings in communal areas the aim according to the department for education dfe is to reduce how many people students come into contact with helping to break transmission chains by giving enough time for symptoms to become apparent if someone at a school tests positive for coronavirus their close contacts could be sent home to isolate for 14 days the guidance said the document was published on friday evening just before the bank holiday weekend with millions of pupils returning to class next week for autumn term mary bousted joint general secretary of the national education union neu said the new government guidance should have been received months ago describing the immediate change in guidance as simply unacceptable she said the decision is a key issue for schools and they should have been consulted as it stands currently there is still no clarity on what should happen in a school where there is an outbreak she added ms bousted said this does not build confidence in governments competence to keep schools safe when it scores such an own goal in the end this advice is better than none at all but only just she also slammed the plan for a lack of investment saying it leaves schools to go it alone in the event an outbreak might require students to stay at home and switch to remote learning remote learning requires significant extra resources both in it provision for students without laptops and internet access and more teachers as those working in schools can not manage a full teaching timetable and plan for remote learning at the same time paul whiteman general secretary of school leaders union naht branded the timing of the new guidance reprehensible he added we ve been calling for the government to publish a plan b for several weeks finally it is here but another late night publication is fairly typical of what we ve become used to while patrick roach general secretary of the nasuwt the teachers union echoed calls for more funding so extra staff can be recruited if schools are affected by local lockdown measures there must be a recognition that whilst children will be affected by local restrictions so too will teachers and other staff in schools he said the government now needs to confirm that schools will have the additional resources they need to deliver an effective remote learning offer to all pupils as well as funding for additional staff labour welcomed the long overdue guidance but said the last minute timing was unfair to head teachers and school leaders labours shadow education secretary kate green said the timing of the guidance beggars belief she added the governments incompetence is insulting to the school leaders and teachers who have worked so hard over summer to prepare schools for children to return robert halfon tory chairman of the commons education select committee said teachers had been given the incredibly difficult task of having just days to prepare for the return of their pupils while julie mcculloch from the association of school and college leaders told itv news the guidance was very late with the timing not ideal boris johnson suggests scotland influenced u - turn on face coverings in schools coronavirus tiny risk of children being hospitalised largest ever study shows boris johnson sacks education mandarin and blames exam fiasco on mutant algorithm the details of the latest guidance to schools the lengthy guidance said schools should base their plans on a four tier system and the extra measures for secondary schools should kick in at the second tier it said schools should ideally operate a rota system that means pupils spend two weeks on site followed by two weeks at home however schools can choose to operate a one week rota so five days on site followed by nine days at home if this is necessary for the effective delivery of the curriculum education secretary gavin williamson said any changes to school attendance will only ever be an absolute last resort he added however it is important that both government and schools prepare for a worst case scenario so this framework represents the sensible contingency planning any responsible government would put in place the guidance added in all areas of national government intervention at schools where students in year seven and above are educated face coverings should be worn by adults and pupils when moving around the premises outside of classrooms such as in corridors and communal areas where social distancing can not easily be maintained the dfe said any suspected coronavirus cases will need to self isolate and get tested face coverings mandatory in english schools in areas of local lockdown says education secretary it added if a case is confirmed local public health officials will work with the school to take appropriate measures including asking all members of a pupils bubble to isolate for 14 days and access remote education while other pupils continue attending the guidance does not apply to primary school children as scientific evidence indicates they play a limited role in transmission it added all schools remain open at tier one while tiers three and four mean more stringent restrictions such as closures to all but pupils in vulnerable groups or children of key workers earlier on friday englands deputy chief medical officer dr jenny harries commented on the issue of face masks for school pupils saying the evidence on face coverings is not very strong in either direction at the moment the evidence is pretty stable but it can be very reassuring in those enclosed environments for children and for teachers as well to know that people are taking precautions she said the advice could change in the future the dfe also updated its guidance on music performances in schools saying singing wind and brass playing should not take place in choirs or ensembles without significant space plenty of natural air flow for players and audiences and strict social distancing and mitigation coronavirus guidance explained for schools in local lockdown areas face coverings mandatory in english schools in areas of local lockdown the health secretary says he hopes the backlog in cancer care will be cleared within months but can not rule out further treatments and operations being cancelled this winter speaking exclusively to itv news matt hancock said the number of people waiting longer than the 62-day nhs england target to begin treatment for cancer after an urgent gp referral had increased substantially since the coronavirus crisis began in march when asked how big the nhs cancer backlog had become mr hancock did nt say but cancer research uk estimates 2.4 million people were waiting for acancer screening further tests or cancer treatment at the end of may as covid-19 caused the biggestdelays in cancer screening with a backlog of around 2.1 million people left waiting for breast bowel or cervical screening i feel a bit let down coronavirus costs cancer patient survival hope breast cancer what are the symptoms what are the survival odds and what are the causes of breast cancer cancer research uk says duringthis time 3,800 cancers would normally be diagnosed through screening the health secretary insists though that the nhs is capable of dealing with the cancer backlog as winter approaches we've had to take action right across the nhs to make sure that we deal with covid the health secretary told itv news it was very important when there were a lot of new cases of covid that people were n't made more at risk of covid because of treatments especially for cancer but now it 's incredibly important for people to come forward the number of people who have been waiting for longer than the 62 days which is the standard that we want to see has increased substantially but the good news is that since the peak that backlog has more or less halved so we 're working through the backlog asked when the backlog would be cleared mr hancock said he very much hoped it would happen within a matter of months but would not rule out more treatments screenings or operations being cancelled "one of the things that as health secretary is that you do n't use the word guarantee what i can say though is that we are already on the path to recovering the situation in cancer which as i say had to unfortunately stop the health secretary was speaking at addenbrookes hospital in cambridge where he was announcing an extra50 m for diagnostic centres of excellence which will develop artificial intelligence to diagnose diseases including cancer the government says the fundingwill support the long term response to covid-19 and is part of its commitment to detect three quarters of cancers at an early stage by 2028 in the short term mr hancocks priority is on finding a coronavirus vaccine and he says the search is heading in the right direction we do n't rule out a vaccine coming on stream this year but by no means is that a done deal next year is more likely a very difficult science it 's thankfully one that our scientists are up to and each sign at the moment is going well and going in the right direction but we do n't want to raise people 's hopes too much health secretary also raised concerns of a growing number of so called anti - vaccination campaigns opposed to a coronavirus vaccine i have seen an increase in anti - vax messages and anti - test messages and these sorts of conspiracy theories and they are wrong we need to address them very directly there 's a programme of work on the way in government to make that happen it is critical that should a vaccine come through that people then have kind of have the confidence to get vaccinated in order to protect themselves and protect their community "yet until a vaccine is found social distancing and other restrictions are likely to remain in place for the foreseeable future with mr hancock suggesting there would be no special measures put in place for the christmas period there 's a challenge over winter too which is that we know that diseases spread more easily in the cold weather both because the actual biology of the disease that can survive more in the cold but also because we know that outside is safer and people obviously spend more time indoors in winter so we 're doing a huge amount of planning to make sure that the nhs is prepared and can cope to make sure that people can have as much freedom to enjoy christmas to enjoy winter as possible "asked about anyexceptions over the festive period for instance to allow more people to see one another the health secretary said well the danger of a rule like that is that it increases the spread of the disease i mean there are an awful lot of things i 'd love to be able to do but the risk of them is that we see an uptick in the disease hence we 've had to take decisions that you would n't ever want to he also defended the government over its latest u - turn on face coverings in schools dealing with a crisis of that is entirely unprecedented we 're dealing with a disease that did n't even exist as far as we know before december last year so we 're taking decisions guided by the science on it i think what people would get really cross about is if a government refuses to change even if evidence came up that there was a better option the race for a coronavirus vaccine what progress has been made and when will it be ready coronavirus where you live in the uk check the number of cases in your area with our

he was blocked from heading the influential body the ex - transport secretary has written to the man who beat him to the chairmanship of the committee last month julian lewis to tender his resignation from the isc mr lewis was expelled from the parliamentary conservative party after being elected head of the body with the backing of opposition mps julian lewis slams improper bid to impose pms choice as head of security committee in the aftermath of the vote for chairman mr lewis condemned what he called downing streets attempt to impose its preferred candidate to lead the committee the move came after mr grayling was widely seen as prime minister boris johnsons favoured candidate for the prestigious job in a statement at the time mr lewis said that the 2013 justice and security act explicitly removed the right of the prime minister to choose the isc chairman and gave it to the committee members amid the controversy downing street denied that the government was seeking to parachute a preferred candidate into the chairmanship insisting that it was a matter for the senior parliamentarians on the committee to decide the impression that the prime minister wanted mr grayling to head the committee which oversees the work of the intelligence agencies mi5 mi6 and gchq drew raised eyebrows across the political spectrum unlike previous chairmen the former transport secretary had little experience of security matters and was dubbed failing grayling for a series of policy blunders during his time in government the decision to withdraw the government whip from mr lewis left the conservatives without a majority on the nine member committee the spat over the chairmanship came ahead of the release of a much delayed report by the isc on alleged russian

winning his coveted second term the whole speech on thursday night felt more like a trumprally than a formal speech to accept his party 's nomination for the presidency the setting was the most notable feature and one that has outraged his critics who say the president has used federal property as a backdrop for a nakedly political agenda for this was the south lawn of the white house overlooking the national mall and the washington monument two thousand people were in the audience despite the pandemic and few were wearing masks that in itself was a defiant political statement despite his assault on biden and the democrats the most notable aspect of the speech was what trump didnotsay he made no attempt to reach out to the black community despite its anguish no mention was made of the shooting of jacob blake no mention was made of pro - police white vigilante violence only of socialist anarchists and of left wing mobs the president even suggested police officers and governors should be more aggressive and be quicker to ask for federal reinforcements a few hundred metres away we watched a very different scene unfold protesters furious with a president who appears to be ignoring the grievances of black americans these activists reject trump 's very notion of law and order they see the president as an agent of chaos deliberately stoking racial tension after his speech this showman president had a surprise in store a spectacular fireworks display on the national mall with a message in the sky that read trump 2020 at the end of the night as he watched the fireworks with his extended family at his side trump looked grim he was n't punching the air there was no adrenaline flowing the president seemed as he would put it low energy perhaps as he stood

in our care sector the kingston and surbiton mp added sir davey said when boris johnson said protect the nhs no one objected and the nhs have been fantastic but boris johnson betrayed the care sector

government to do more and to champion caring and to champion looking after bereaved families the 54-year old added one thing i 've campaigned on throughout my life is bereaved families not in a very public way you may not have noticed but behind the scenes i 've been working with bereaved charities particularly children who have been bereaved he continued this is something that i feel passionate

played down coronavirus and spoke about race relations during the last night of the republican national convention accepting his partys nomination for president the us president warned voters the country would face economic ruin if the democratic nomination mr biden was elected in november here are some of the top takeaways from mr trumps speech from the outside the white house trump strikes a familiar tone with attacks on biden mr trump warned that the american way life would be under threat if joe biden and the democrats seize control of the white house in the upcoming election he said the second amendment which gives americans the right to bear arms would be taken away and that mr biden would wreak havoc in leafy suburbs if the left gains power they will demolish the suburbs confiscate your guns and appoint justices who will wipe away your second amendment and other constitutional freedoms trump said he has been intent on labelling biden who is considered a moderate democrat as an extreme leftist warning that socialist policies would ruin the country trump said joe biden may claim he is an ally of the light but when it comes to his agenda biden wants to keep you completely in the dark trump defies his own administrations guidelines on coronavirus while covid-19 kills more than 1,000 americans a day that did not stop around 1,500 people piling onto the south lawn of the white house to watch trumps address to the nation trump spoke to supporters for more than an hour to a tightly packed largely maskless crowd the us has been the hardest hit nation in the world by coronavirus with more than 6 million infections and 184,000 deaths the gop and trumps campaign transformed the white house grounds of the south lawn into an outdoor convention hall complete with a grand stage massive trump signs rows of white chairs and a blur of american flags notwithstanding the federal law that prohibits the use of taxpayer resources for partisan politics to top it off masks were not required chairs were placed close together with no room for social distancing and many attendees had not been tested for covid-19 i ve done more for the african american community than any president since abraham lincoln race relations in the us continues to be a hot topic across the political aisle the deaths of george floyd breonna taylor and most recently jacob blake have once again shone a light on an uncomfortable problem within us society with the democrats and the republicans each blaming one another trump and the republicans frequently denounce black lives matter as an organisation designed to sow disharmony amongst american society while biden and the democrats cite trumps rhetoric for increased tensions between different ethnic communities at thursdays republican national convention it was trumps turn yet again to extol the virtues of his record as president i ve done more for the african american community than any president since abraham lincoln our first republican president trump boasted to large cheers from those in attendance outside the white house lawn and i have done more in three years for the black community than joe biden has done in 47 years when i m reelected the best is yet to come trump vows to rebuild us economy and make america great again again coronavirus has had a profound impact on the us not only on human life but also the economy millions have been left unemployed by the crisis but trump offered an optimistic outlook for the future if he wins another four years he mocked his opponents record and famous empathy suggesting that laid off workers in michigan ohio new hampshire pennsylvania do nt want joe bidens hollow words of empathy they wanted their jobs back in 2016 trump famously vowed to make america great again following eight years under barack obama and the democrats and while he s been in office for four years now the coronavirus pandemic has put the us economy in reverse but trumps message remains the same as 2016 donald trump 's big speech a fierce attack on biden that failed to offer any comfort to black americans republican party convention the trump fightback is unleashed on night

return to town they should not be worried about infections as a result of travelling on trains and buses we can all see the devastating consequences for many businesses when a huge proportion of the customers on whom they depend simply are nt coming into our towns and cities meanwhile sir iain duncan smith former tory party leader told the newspaper the government must have a clear and simple message that civil servants should show the way and get back to work they ve got to stop mixing that message the reality is that small businesses that provide the vast majority of jobs in the uk rely on people in city centres being back in their offices if they do not go back many of those businesses will collapse which will lead to higher unemployment and in turn impact on peoples mental and

strong ties with president donald trump even as mr abes ultra - nationalism riled the koreas and china abe taken to hospital for check up schools to close for a month in effort to contain coronavirus while he pulled japan out of recession the economy has been battered by the coronavirus pandemic and he has failed to achieve his cherished goal to formally rewrite the us drafted pacifist

a normal and beautiful nation with a stronger military and more focus on the non - political emperor concerns about his chronic health issues simmering since earlier this summer intensified this month when he visited a tokyo hospital two weeks in a row for unspecified health check ups mr abe whose term ends in september 2021 is expected to stay on until a new party leader is elected and formally approved by parliament he abruptly resigned from his first stint in office in 2007 due to his health which has fuelled concerns about his recent condition on monday he became japans longest serving prime minister by consecutive days in office eclipsing the record of eisaku sato his great uncle who served 2,798 days from 1964 to 1972 but mr abes second hospital visit on monday has accelerated speculation and political manoeuvring towards a post - abe regime he has acknowledged having ulcerative colitis since he was a teenager and has said the condition was controlled with treatment he has not made clear if it is related to his recent health issues or hospital visits after his recent hospital visits were reported senior officials from mr abes cabinet and the ruling party said he was

democrats have elected sir ed davey as their new leader by more than 17,000 votes the former cabinet minister said the lib dems have to wake up and smell the coffee after a series of disappointing general election results the kingston and surbiton mp who has been acting leader since jo swinson lost her seat in the 2019 general election defeated layla moran to win the leadership by 42,756 votes to 24,564 sir ed said his job is to rebuild the liberal democrats to national relevance but acknowledged none of this is going to be easy none of this is going to be straightforward we have to wake up and smell the coffee says sir davey after being elected as leader at an event in london to announce the leadership result sir ed said we have to wake up and smell the coffee nationally our party has lost touch with too many voters yes we are powerful advocates locally our campaigners listen to local people work hard for communities and deliver results but at the national level we have to face the facts of three disappointing general election results the 54-year old added the truth is voters do nt believe the liberal democrats want to help ordinary people get on in life voters do nt believe we share their values and voters do nt believe we are on the side of people like them he added so who is sir ed davey sir ed davey has been a prominent figure in the liberal democrats for decades and now faces a battle to revive the partys fortunes at the height of the lib dems influence under nick clegg sir ed sat at the cabinet table as energy and climate change secretary during the coalition with the conservative party but the decision to join forces with david cameron proved disastrous for the party with sir ed among dozens of lib dem casualties in the 2015 election losing his kingston and surbiton seat to his conservative rival he won the seat back in 2017 but did not stand for the leadership after tim farron quit explaining that he wanted to spend time with his family wife emily and their children john and ellie in the 2019 leadership contest prompted by the resignation of sir vince cable 54-year old sir ed was defeated by jo swinson who subsequently lost her own seat in decembers general election it has been a long road to the leadership for sir ed who was first elected in 1997 and was chief of staff to former leader sir menzies campbell in 1994 before entering parliament sir ed won a bravery award for rescuing a woman who had fallen on to the tracks at clapham junction station in south london his early life was marked by tragedy with his father dying when he was four and his mother when he was 15 sir ed attended the private nottingham high school former labour minister ed balls was in the year below and then studied politics philosophy and economics ppe at oxford how have politicians reacted to sir ed davey as leader of the lib dems former lib dem leader tim farron tweeted congratulations edward davey on becoming our new leader ed is a fantastic campaigner who has the experience and vision to move our party forward leadership elections are long and tough contests so i want to pay tribute to layla moran who has run a really energetic campaign conservative party co - chairman amanda milling said at the election last year the british people decided to move on from years of division and deadlock but the liberal democrats want to keep on playing the same old politics she added they have a new leader in place but he has shown time and again he does not share the values of the british people ms moran who lost by more than 18,000 votes congratulated the new leader and said i look forward to working with him to campaign for a better future for britain on twitter she wrote thank you so much to all my campaign team and volunteers i am so proud of the positive inclusive campaign we ran i hope you ll all join me in supporting edward davey as our new leader green party mp caroline lucas tweeted congratulations to new libdem leader edward davey look forward to working together and with all opposition parties to hold this appalling government to account & to reform our archaic undemocratic electoral system for good mayor of london sadiq khan tweeted congratulations edward davey looking forward to working with you in the best interest of all londoners what next for the lib dems the scale of the task now facing the new leader is clear the lib dems won 62 seats in 2005 and 57 in 2010 but have since struggled in general elections in 2015 they were reduced to a rump of just eight mps in 2017 that rose to 12 but fell back to 11 in 2019 but with labour moving towards the centre following sir keir starmers leadership victory the space for the lib dems in british politics may be further squeezed jo swinsons campaign

lawyers who are representing migrants home secretary priti patel 's department has faced fierce criticism from legal figures over a video posted to its twitter account about its efforts to remove

are simply doing their best under exceptionally difficult circumstances to assist deeply vulnerable clients this is nt an attack on activism it is an assault on the rule of law and peoples constitutional right to access justice the government can keep saying what they are saying but well continue to do what we are doing simon davis president of the law society of england and wales said attacks on the integrity of the legal profession undermine the rule of law to describe lawyers who are upholding the law as activist lawyers is misleading and dangerous we should be proud that we live

brexit and second covid wave coincide why the uk 's fishing industry could be the issue that scuppers a brexit deal with the eu the decision to u - turn on advice around face coverings in schools was influenced by the experience of pupils in scotland who are already back in the classroom the prime minister has suggested boris johnson said he was following world health organization advice in his decision to change policy on the use of face coverings in english schools but he also suggested what they discovered in scotland was a contributing factor there have been several coronavirus outbreaks north of the border since schools reopened there earlier this month with 19 staff and pupils testing positive at one education hub when the outbreak at kingspark school in dundee increased from six on friday to at least 19 on monday scotland 's first minister nicola sturgeon decided to enforce face coverings at secondary schools the who changed its advice over the weekend saying everyone over the age of 12 should wear a face covering where social distancing is more difficult face coverings mandatory in english schools in areas of local lockdown says education secretary scotland adopted the who 's advice on tuesday and went further by also asking children over five to wear them while travelling on dedicated school transport for days mr johnson resisted pressure to adopt the who advice with his deputy chief medical officer jenny harries saying the evidence on whether children over 12 should wear masks in schools was not strong england 's education secretary gavin williamson claimed several of the measures being adopted by schools to limit the spread of coronavirus meant masks were not required but with a week to go before millions of students resume their studies in england a u - turn was made explaining the policy shift the pm said what you ve got is the who saying face coverings should be used by over-12s face coverings advised for school pupils as young as five in certain settings in scotland what were saying is if you re in a school where there is a hot spot then it probably does make sense in confined areas outside the classroom to use a face coverings in the corridor and elsewhere as they discovered in scotland where they ve had the kids in for at least a couple of weeks now what they found was that it was raining outside people were coming in and they were congregating in the corridors and the move to face coverings they thought was sensible he added that face coverings in classrooms was clearly nonsensical you ca nt teach with face coverings you ca nt expect people to learn with face coverings in wales pupils over the age of 11 in will be recommended to wear face coverings in school communal areas where social distancing can not be maintained the welsh government said the new guidance also covers pupils on school transport college students and staff and will require schools and local authorities to carry out risk assessments of their sites to determine if the two metre rule can not be maintained england 's education secretary williamson defended the latest u - turn saying the public would want to see a government that was willing to be able to change and adapt schools to receive just 10 coronavirus home testing kits and only small amount of ppe how many u turns before the government heads in the right direction he explained why so many last minute switches in policy had been made during the coronavirus pandemic saying sometimes we have to adapt to the fact it is unprecedented times and we do have to change our course of action at the suggestion that the uk had been much slower to adapt than other countries mr williamson said no not at all we 've led the way in our fight against coronavirus while visiting castle rock school in coalville leicestershire where pupils have returned mr johnson said students had lost too much time from their learning as a result of the pandemic and encouraged all youngsters to return to their classrooms when schools reopen for the autumn term he added school is safe it is exciting it is the place to learn it is the place where people are going to be absorbing in the next few days and weeks young people are going to be absorbing things they will never forget advice from the who on face coverings says children aged 12 and over should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults in particular when they can not guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area nicola sturgeon has called for reform of the uk 's deeply inhumane asylum system after a woman was found dead in a glasgow flat beside her starving baby the scottish first minister said she is consumed with sadness and anger at the death of 34-year old mercy baguma the ugandan woman 's body was discovered by police in govan on saturday the positive action in housing paih charity said ms baguma 's one year old son was found crying beside his mothers body weakened from several days of starvation the baby has since been released from hospital into the care of his father speaking at first minister 's questions ms sturgeon said i find myself consumed with sadness but also with real anger at the death of mercy baguma ms sturgeon continued we knew this before this tragedy but it is underlined by this tragedy the uk asylum system is not just broken it is deeply inhumane and it must be changed people who come to scotland because they need a place of safety should have our support and that is even more true right now at this time of crisis ms sturgeon said her government has repeatedly raised concerns about the westminster reserved asylum process she added we need wholesale reform of our asylum system and we need to start from the principle of dignity of empathy and of support for our fellow human beings who come to this country seeking support at desperate and dismal times of their lives i would appeal to the uk government to look into their hearts as a result of this case and finally make the changes that are needed to housing ms sturgeon added she would support all efforts to investigate ms bagumas death including backing the paih charitys

off dover coast by fishing day trippers how many u turns can a government make before its heading in the right direction quite a few it turns out the huff post reckons there have been an impressive 11 u turns on various aspects of coronavirus policy some of these have been of the full on screeching variety notably when sticking with moderated a level grades became scrapping moderated a level grades and giving out teacher assessed grades instead others have been less abrupt such as when ending the evictions ban became extending the evictions ban by four weeks less of a u - turn perhaps and more of a start stop start like a learner driver struggling with the clutch and then there s testing again you would nt really call it a u - turn more a start stop start followed by some over enthusiastic revving that fails to deliver the desired acceleration but the driver claims to be racing along anyway now to be fair to ministers they are dealing with a developing crisis of uncertain duration caused by a new virus about which the science is constantly evolving reactive policy making is essential or as keynes put it when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir but too much mind changing does nt convey a sense of grip even when its completely reasonable the backbenchers hate it the media revel in it and the opposition leverage it for all its worth the bigger problem is that so much of this mind changing has come rather late in the day again and again the scottish welsh and northern irish governments seem to be making the big calls first everyone else can see a u turn coming but the government in whitehall insists there wo nt be one until there is and that looks both indecisive and slow face coverings in english secondary schools will not become mandatory says education secretary government u - turn over a level and gcse results education secretary gavin williamson said face coverings are only mandatory in english schools in local lockdown areas as he defended the latest government u - turn which will see some children told to wear them late on tuesday evening just one week before most schools reopen the government made a switch in policy by abandoning advice that pupils should not wear face masks in english secondary schools the department for education dfe now advises in areas under local restrictions such as swathes of greater manchester that face coverings should be worn when moving around corridors and communal areas it is only in those local lockdown areas that it is going to be required in a mandatory way mr williamson insisted to itv news the education secretary tried to defend the government 's frequent u turns saying the public would want to see a government that was willing to be able to change and adapt he explained why so many last minute switches in policy had been made during the coronavirus pandemic saying sometimes we have to adapt to the fact it is unprecedented times and we do have to change our course of action at the suggestion that the uk had been much slower to adapt than other countries mr williamson said no not at all we 've led the way in our fight against coronavirus teaching unions have welcomed the government 's u - turn on face coverings geoff barton general secretary of the association of school & college leaders said the rule change gave teachers flexibility to decide their own rules what do the new recommendations in england say in local lockdown areas face coverings should be worn by staff and students moving around schools in communal areas and corridors from september 1 should new local restrictions be imposed schools will need to communicate quickly and clearly the new arrangements to staff parents and pupils all schools and colleges will have the discretion to require face coverings in communal areas where social distancing can not be safely managed such as when the layout of a school makes it difficult to do so where a student or staff member is struggling to access a mask or if it soiled or unsafe the guidance says that schools should take steps to have a small contingency supply available adding no one should be excluded on the grounds that they are not wearing a face covering exemptions to the new measures include those who can not put on wear or remove a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or impairment or disability or if a person is speaking to or providing assistance to someone who relies on lip reading clear sound or facial expression to communicate he pointed out that schools differ in a range of areas from the size of the corridors to communal spaces and in the safety plans that headteachers and governors have put in place mr barton said i think that ultimately to be able to say in a school yes we will or no we wo nt require you to wear face coverings or if you want to wear one fine but you really do nt need to because other things are more important i actually think that reflects the way the english education system traditionally has worked giving more responsibility to headteachers who know their context and are trusted by their communities face coverings in school will not be mandatory the government said but headteachers have the discretion to make them compulsory in communal areas coverings will not need to be worn in classrooms because other protective measures will already be in place and they might affect learning it added political correspondent daniel hewitt reported on the government 's u - turn shortly after it was made the new guidance came after pressure from teaching unions and followed scotlands announcement that secondary pupils there will be required to wear face coverings in between lessons post - primary pupils in northern ireland will be asked to wear face coverings in corridors and other communal areas stormonts education minister peter weir said on tuesday a decision on face coverings in schools will be made in wales on wednesday just this week education secretary williamson insisted measures being adopted by schools to limit the spread of coronavirus meant masks were not required and a number 10 spokesperson had said there were no plans to review the guidance but speaking on wednesday mr williamson said a cautious and careful approach had been taken by the government in order to get children back to school at every stage what were focused on is making sure all children return back to school in september we do nt want to be seeing children wearing masks in schools up and down the country but in certain areas where its necessary where were in local lockdown he added we ve seen the move welcomed by unions in terms of clarity that it brings because there was some concern in the teaching community quite understandably when they saw the advice come out from the world health organisation it comes after prime minister boris johnson said he would consider changing the guidance but would look at the changing medical evidence as we go on if we need to change the advice then of course we will he added the world health organization who published new guidance on the wearing of face coverings in secondary schools in a statement they said children aged 12 and over should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults in particular when they can not guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area full guidance has not yet been published but is expected shortly the department said and will come into effect from september 1 in a warning that advice could change again the dfe said stricter guidance could be issued for schools nationally if the rate of transmission increases across the country the advice will also apply to further education colleges and will be reflected in guidance to universities the department said it will not apply in primary schools because the risks to children in those settings are lower the dfe said how the rules differ

slave trade video report by itv news political correspondent daniel hewitt the scottish government is considering whether to enforce face coverings for pupils and teachers in some school settings nicola sturgeon has confirmed the world health organisation is advising that children aged 12 and above should wear face coverings but ms sturgeon said her government is considering new rules which would go beyond the who guidance the who advice which was updated over the weekend came amid a handful of coronavirus outbreaks in scottish schools kingspark school in dundee was forced to close last week after six adults tested positive for covid-19 but a further spike was announced on sunday revealing a number of children had also contracted it along with more than a dozen staff members in total two pupils 17 members of staff and three community contacts have now tested positive for covid-19 itv news political correspondent daniel hewitt discusses what is happening with schools in england at least three more education hubs in scotland have experienced outbreaks since schools there were told to reopen from august 11 ms sturgeon said scotland 's education secretary john swinney is working on a recommendation for staff and pupils in secondary schools to wear face coverings when they are moving around in corridors and communal areas she said he was considering whether to make them compulsory in places where mixing is more likely such as corridors and communal areas close contact in these areas is more likely and voices could be raised resulting in greater chances for aerosol transmission and finally there is often less scope for effective ventilation in these areas despite the potential move by scotland the central government in westminster is resisting pressure to adopt the who advice how have schools in northern ireland become covid secure asked about comments by first minister sturgeon 's comments education secretary gavin williamson said we are not in a position where we are suggesting that we believe there is a system of controls there in place in all schools for children to be able to return safely and for staff to be able to operate safely within those schools a number 10 spokesman said there are no plans to review the guidance on face coverings in schools we are conscious of the fact that it would obstruct communication between teachers and pupils kingspark school is just one of a handful of centres scotland which have recorded positive cases since scottish students started returning to schools on august 11 a single positive case has been linked to the primary 2a class at st peter and pauls school in the city and a positive case has been linked to happy times out of school club at downfield primary school risk of children catching covid at school very very small boris johnson says ahead of reopening coronavirus risk at school not zero but small compared to damage done by not attending professor chris whitty says nhs tayside and dundee city council released a statement saying all pupils in the affected school class had been asked to self isolate for 14 days along with all those who attended the out of school club meanwhile a member of staff and two pupils at high blantyre primary school have tested positive for covid-19 nhs lanarkshire said adults and children connected to primary three or primary four had been asked not to attend class the outbreaks will be of concerns to parents in england who are just one week away from sending their children back to school many for the first time in five months the spike appears to contradict messaging from the prime minister who on monday morning posted a video on twitter claiming the risk was very very very small that children would catch the virus while at school boris johnson conceded that parents are genuinely still a bit worried about their children contractingcoronavirus but insisted schools are safe deputy chief medical officer jenny harries reiterated his message that younger children they 're less likely to get it on coronavirus in schools the pm said the risks are very very very small that they ll even get it but then the risk that they ll suffer from it badly are very very very very small indeed ms harries said that covid was generally a mild disease for children we think that maybe for younger children they 're less likely to get it and we know that they are much less likely to be hospitalised and very very unlikely to die from the disease so the balance is very much in favour of going to school scotlands education secretary john swinney said there s been very limited prevalence of covid-19 in the early days of pupils returning to classrooms in the country on the bbcs world at one programme mr swinney was asked about kingspark school in dundee where 17 staff have tested positive for coronavirus mr swinney said i think its important to indicate that this issue is being taken very very seriously by our incident management team on the ground disadvantaged pupils will find it impossible to catch up unless 2021 exams change neu warns there has been extensive testing undertaken and contact tracing as there should be in any example of a positive case emerging so that issue is being taken seriously in that school i think its also important to recognise that this is one of two and a half thousand schools that are open across scotland and over the course of the last couple of weeks in which schools have been opened we ve had some limited examples of the presence of covid within schools and that s to be welcomed the fact that its been a very limited prevalence of covid in our schools in these early days dr ellie hothersall consultant in public health medicine with nhs tayside acknowledged the outbreak may cause anxiety to some parents and children but said advice had been issued to keep everyone safe the smaller outbreaks at other schools in dundee were identified following detailed contact tracing nhs tayside said kingspark school is expected to remain closed until at least next week while a deep clean is carried out the government has not provided any specific guidance to older children and teachers with just days to go before a return to schools despite evidence showing coronavirus poses a much higher risk to them the prime minister has been seeking to reassure parents that schools are safe and everything has been done to ensure risk is minimised but labour has attacked the government for not providing tailored guidance boris johnson in a video released on twitter told parents the risk to their children in sending them back to school is very very very small the education secretary said a very clear system of controls has been set out so that schools are able to return safely with just one week before the pm 's planned reopening of schools in england questions have been raised about why the government has taken a one size fits all approach to guidance evidence shows that coronavirus is a mild disease for most children however there is a much higher chance of negative outcomes in older students and teachers when asked why there had been no specific guidance education secretary gavin williamson did not provide an explanation he claimed the government had been incredibly clear with its guidance which he said had been provided following advice from the uk 's chief medical officers asked about comments by scottish first minister nicola sturgeon that some secondary school teachers and pupils may wear masks in some settings the education secretary said we are not in a position where we are suggesting that we believe there is a system of controls there in place in all schools for children to be able to return safely and for staff to be able to operate safely within those schools labour 's shadow education secretary kate green accused the government of being missing in action over schools policy during the pandemic the guidance that s been given to schools is one size fits all it does nt take account of the fact that a small school perhaps in very constrained premises will have to make different arrangements from a large inner city school she said there has nt been information for school leaders so that they ca nt plan what they might have to do if there was a sudden spike in the local infection rate and the guidance that has come out i think has been its been contradictory its been confusing it came very late shortly before the summer holidays how have schools in northern ireland become covid secure mr williamson said closing schools again in areas of any imposed local lockdowns would be the absolute last resort adding how there is more harm done to them by not being there many parents are concerned about the risk to their children and household if they go back to school where social distancing may be more difficult but experts have been warning that any more time away from education could have a long term impact on the development of more disadvantaged pupils prime minister johnson earlier told parents it is absolutely vital that they send their children back to school in september mr johnson whose fiancee gave birth to his son wilfred earlier this year conceded that parents are genuinely still a bit worried about their children contracting coronavirus at school but suggested the risk to youngsters would be worse if they did n't return disadvantaged pupils will find it impossible to catch up unless 2021 exams change neu warns its vital for their education its vital for their welfare its vital for their physical and indeed their mental wellbeing he said so lets make sure that all kids all pupils get back to school at the beginning of september he insisted the risks are very very very small that they ll even get it but then the risk that they ll suffer from it badly are very very very very small indeed most children have spent five months or more away from school however disadvantaged children without access to learning materials will suffer more from time off than their peers who have access to laptops and tutoring experts have been warning the education attainment gap between children of different backgrounds will widen the longer children are kept out of schools in a tweet following the video mr johnson said nothing will have a greater effect on the life chances of our children than returning to school its vital that parents understand that schools are safe the pm said in his video adding that teachers have gone to great lengths to get schools ready coronavirus risk at school not zero but small compared to damage done by not attending professor chris whitty says he reminded parents that many teachers have had children in their classrooms throughout the pandemic" lots of schools have been open and looking after kids very very successfully he said adding how they will take steps to ensure that groups are nt mixed up that we have washing of hands and all the other disciplines you need to prevent spread of the virus" many pupils in england have not been to class since march when schools were closed except to look after vulnerable children and those of keyworkers schools in scotland reopened earlier this month while those in england wales and northern ireland are expected to welcome all pupils from the beginning of september earlier mr johnson thanked school staff who have spent the summer months making classrooms covid secure in preparation for a full return in september we have always been guided by our scientific and medical experts and we now know far more about coronavirus than we did earlier this year deputy chief medical officer for england jenny harries reiterated the prime minister 's message that the risks of not going to school were far greater than the virus to children she told itv news we ca n't ever say that an environment is 100 % safe but we recognise that concern from parents the uk chief medical officers and deputy chief medical officers from england scotland have looked at all the of the evidence both from the uk and internationally and the clear statement at the end of that was that a child missing out on their education is a much greater risk for them than covid for most children she said that being out of school reduced children 's health in the long term and the effects are worse for children from more deprived backgrounds ms harries said that covid was generally a mild disease for children we think that maybe for younger children they 're less likely to get it and we know that they are much less likely to be hospitalised and very very unlikely to die from the disease so the balance is very much in favour of going to school shadow education secretary ms green accused the government of being asleep at the wheel on reopening of schools the government has to make the conditions suitable and safe for schools for staff for students and its been asleep at the wheel she told itvs good morning britain its been not paying the attention that schools need to the details of how they are going to reopen nor has it been out sending a strong and clear message to parents she added in terms of making preparations for their return while headteachers principals and school staff have been working really hard over the last few weeks of the summer holidays to make the schools safe i think the government has been missing in action to be quite honest how will schools return safely in september the eus trade commissioner has issued a fulsome and profound apology as calls for him to quit after attending a golf dinner during the pandemic intensify irishman phil hogan has been urged to consider his position by the leaders of the republics coalition government micheal martin and leo varadkar after the event at a hotel in the west of ireland with more than 80 people present he is a senior irish politician with significant standing in brussels who would be deeply involved in any deal with britain after brexit in a statement he said i acknowledge my actions have touched a nerve for the people of ireland something for which i am profoundly sorry i realise fully the unnecessary stress risk and offence caused to the people of ireland by my attendance at such an event at such a difficult time for all and i am extremely sorry for this police are investigating whether coronavirus regulations were broken in holding the irish parliaments golf society event two days after the government announced it intended to curb the numbers permitted to gather together a resurgence in covid-19 cases in recent weeks has led ireland to backtrack on some of its plan to reopen society after lockdown the function was held across two rooms in the hotel in clifden other attendees including the then agriculture minister dara calleary have resigned a supreme court judge was among others on the guest list mr hogan said i acknowledge that the issue is far bigger than compliance with rules and regulations and adherence to legalities and procedures all of us must display solidarity as we try to stamp out this common plague i thus offer this fulsome and profound apology at this difficult time for all people as the world as a whole combats covid-19 he paid tribute to the wonderful healthcare workers who continue to put their lives on the line to combat covid-19 and to everyone who has lost a loved one during the pandemic an irish government statement said mr martin and his deputy mr varadkar both believe the event should never have been held that the commissioners apology came late and that he still needs to give a full account and explanation of his actions mr hogan is the eus former agriculture commissioner and oversaw significant reform of the common agricultural policy trade is a central issue in the eus efforts to build agreement with the uk to mitigate any ill effects from brexit the commissioner is a native of kilkenny in the south east of the country and a former irish environment minister for fine gael it is the eu commission president who would have to force his resignation mr varadkar told rte radio 1 the apology had helped but mr hogan should go further and explain his movements around ireland he said he needs to answer any questions people have got about the dinner and also his movements within the country and in and out of kildare kildare where the commissioner has a property has been subjected to local pandemic restrictions due to an elevated number of covid-19 cases mr varadkar expressed confidence in mr hogans ability to do his duty as trade commissioner and said he has done a good job in that post so far it is our view that an apology is welcome but he also needs to account for himself and explain and answer any questions that might arise not just in relation to the dinner but also his movements around the country if he can not do that he needs to consider his position he added sinn fein president mary lou mcdonald who leads the opposition to the coalition government in dublin said the commissioners position was untenable it is very clear that he has lost the confidence of the government the taoiseach and tanaiste have asked him to consider his position that really means game over it would be very very alarming and would deepen the sense of crisis and chaos if the commissioner were to stay on

migrants have crossed to the uk in small boats so far in 2020 analysis by the press association suggests the number of people trying to reach british shores has surged in the summer months prompting the government to deploy raf planes to the english channel in an effort to tackle the problem more than 1,000 others are known to have been intercepted by french authorities as they tried to reach the uk it comes in spite of home secretary priti patel 's vow last year that migrant crossings would be an infrequent phenomenon by now and her recent pledge to make the route completely unviable french prosecutors have launched an investigation following the death of a 16-year old sudanese migrant whose body was found on a beach near calais earlier this week recent attempts by the government to put a stop to migrant crossings have included asking the armed forces for help and the appointment of a new clandestine channel threat commander meanwhile the government has called on councils to take

stupid dangerous and criminal thing to do says prime minister boris johnson ministers have agreed a four week extension to the evictions ban in england and wales after warnings that hundreds of thousands of renters could lose their homes it follows growing unease that tens of thousands of people in rented accommodation who have built up large arrears during the coronavirus lockdown could be out on the streets within months the government confirmed there will be a new six month notice period to be in place until at least 31 march 2021 in order to give tenants greater protection from eviction housing secretary robert jenrick said:"i know this year has been challenging and all of us are still living with the effects of covid-19 that is why today i am announcing a further four week ban on evictions meaning no renters will have been evicted for six months i am also increasing protections for renters six month notice periods must be given to tenants supporting renters over winter thousands of renters could lose their homes by christmas renters given eviction protection during coronavirus lockdown mr jenrick continued however it is right that the most egregious cases for example those involving anti - social behaviour or domestic abuse perpetrators begin to be heard in court again and so when courts reopen landlords will once again be able to progress these priority cases rentershave been protected during the covid-19 crisisby a government ban announced in march extended in june and which was due to end on monday if it was lifted without extra protection charities were warning that tens of thousands of outgoing tenants could be unable to find or access affordable homes prompting a devastating homelessness crisis shelter said by the end of june some 174,000 renters had been warned by their landlord that they are facing eviction and 58,000 moved out after being asked to leave during the lockdown labour leader sir keir starmer welcomed the 11th hour u - turn but warned the evictions ban should be extended until a credible plan is in place to prevent anyone losing their home because of the pandemic this 11th hour u - turn was necessary but such a brief extension means there is a real risk that this will simply give renters a few more weeks to pack their bags sir keir said he added boris johnson has been warned for months about the looming evictions crisis but stuck his head in the sand people living in rented accommodation should not be paying the price for this governments incompetence section 21 evictions must be scrapped and renters must be given proper support the ban should not be lifted until the government has a credible plan to ensure that no one loses their home as a result of coronavirus sir keir continued citizens advice chief executive dame gillian guy welcomed the extension to the evictions ban but called for further measures to aid renters who have got into arrears because of the pandemic during this extended pause on new eviction proceedings we hope the government will work with citizens advice and others to put in place a series of protections which will help those who ve built up rent arrears get back on their feet she said we d like to see funding for a dedicated set of protections including measures such as grants for those in arrears due to coronavirus however landlords were left frustrated national residential landlords association chief executive ben beadle heavily criticised the extension saying landlords can not be expected to foot the bill for government failure he said a blanket extension is unacceptable especially so close to the deadline landlords have been left powerless in exercising their legal right to deal with significant arrears unrelated to covid-19 antisocial behaviour and extremely disruptive tenants who make life miserable for their neighbours and housemates private landlords can not be expected to foot the bill for government failure there must now be a plan to support households to pay their bills and to compensate landlords fully for their lost income oldham and blackburn placed under further coronavirus lockdown restrictions coronavirus reproductive rate of infection r number in uk has risen to between 0.9 - 1.1 the eu has accused the uk of wasting valuable time in brexit negotiations adding how it seems unlikely a deal will be reached before the deadline both sides agreed in their statements following the seventh round of talks that time is short and that little progress had been made michel barnier the eus chief brexit negotiator told a press conference following the latest round of talks that too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards he added i simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time david frost said the european union is making it unnecessarily difficult to make progress in talks with the bloc insisting that the uk accepts its position on state aid and fisheries before allowing talks to progress in any other area he said an agreement is still possible it is still our goal but it is clear that it will not be easy to achieve the eu wants a deal to be reached by october so it can be approved by the european parliament before the transition period ends on december 31 government tells firms to stockpile medicines for end of brexit transition brexit substantial areas of disagreement remain between uk and eu in reaching trade deal mr frost said substantive work continues to be necessary across a range of different areas of potential uk eu future co - operation if we are to deliver it we have had useful discussions this week but there has been little progress mr frost said the eu wants the uk to remain signed up to the common fisheries policy and agree continuity with eu state before a deal can be reached both sides blamed the other for the lack of progress in talks the uk hit back at the accusation of time wasting accusing the blocs position of having frozen progress a senior negotiating official for the uk said the process block now is the eus insistence that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else obviously were not going to do that so its frozen that does nt seem to us to be sensible we should be talking about the many other areas some of which are productive some of which are more difficult but we are ready to talk about anything and its not us that s slowing it down the eu 's mr barnier said no progress whatsoever had been made on fisheries speaking at a press conference following the latest round of talks mr barnier said ladies and gentlemen the need for a level playing field is not going to go away even if the uk continues to exist on a low quality agreement on goods and services only he added that it is a non - negotiable pre - condition to grant access to our market of 450 million citizens we are asking for nothing more but nothing less nothing less than what prime minister boris johnson committed to in our joint political declaration last october together with the 27 eu leaders he said the idea of a level playing field is to ensure fairness between the two sides in areas such as labour environment climate sustainable development and subsidy control apart from the question of a level playing field there are still many other areas where progress is needed and for example obviously fisheries where we have made no progress whatsoever on the issues that matter mr barnier added that other areas where more progress is needed include law enforcement where we still struggle to agree on the necessary guarantees to protect citizens fundamental rights and personal data he continued and also mobility and social security co - ordination where our positions are also driven far apart the uk 's mr frost said both sides will continue to work hard to reach an agreement and remain in close contact ahead of the next round of talks in london beginning september 7 thousands of renters could lose their homes around christmas if the government does not give judges powers to stop automatic evictions of tenants hit by the coronavirus outbreak charities fear renters have been protected during the covid-19 crisis by a government ban announced in march extended in june and due to end on monday if this is lifted without extra protection charities are warning that tens of thousands of outgoing tenants could be unable to find or access affordable homes prompting a devastating homelessness crisis renters given eviction protection during coronavirus lockdown key workers at risk of evictions as protections set to end separately the british medical association has warned of a potential surge in covid-19 cases if the ban is not extended and homelessness increases with homeless people more likely to have health conditions increasing their vulnerability labour 's shadow housing minister thangam debbonaire urged the government to act now to avoid more chaos of its own making when evictions are allowed to resume transport secretary grant shapps told lbc radio i know that getting that balance right between the renters and the landlords is something that my colleagues in the housing ministry are working closely on and i think they will make further announcements about it shortly which i m not privy to right now shelter said by the end of june some 174,000 renters had been warned by their landlord that they are facing eviction and 58,000 moved out after being asked to leave during the lockdown it estimates almost a quarter of a million renters had fallen behind on their rent by the end of june but the national residential landlords association said it is wrong to assume every tenant in arrears due to covid-19 is at automatic risk of eviction and extending the ban is not necessary policy director chris norris said landlords have been powerless to take any action against those who cause misery for fellow tenants and neighbours it is unlikely there will be a rush of possession hearings come monday county courts will need to adapt to social distancing measures which will affect the volume of cases while there is also a backlog of cases from before the pandemic any landlord who has lodged a claim before early august will be required to issue a reactivation notice confirming they still wish to pursue it with 21 days notice before the case can be heard they must also set out the effect of the pandemic on the tenant or risk proceedings being adjourned these delays mean it is unlikely any cases would be heard until mid - september it is understood that the most serious cases will be prioritised such as those where extreme arrears have built up or involving anti - social behaviour and domestic abuse this suggests the bulk of covid-19 cases are not likely to take place before the end of october around the same time the governments job retention scheme is due to stop up to half a million people could be at risk of being evicted in the coming months the district councils network dcn estimates councillor giles archibald the dcns better lives spokesman said as the cliff edge nears little has been done to ensure the welfare system will support those vulnerable families at risk of homelessness and we are now at the precipice without a plan polly neate chief executive of shelter said time is fast running out for the government to act without the ban any renter who has built up eight weeks of arrears can be automatically evicted she said with judges powerless to intervene she told the pa news agency the knock on effect of this will be really severe its not something that were going to see next week but its something that well see in the coming months as winter sets in and around christmas time that s when we could see lots of people being evicted if were entering into a deep recession this is not the time that we want to risk having thousands of people approaching overstretched homelessness services that can not hope to provide them with the safe homes they ll need the charity is calling for judges to be given discretion on handling cases involving coronavirus for the benefits cap to be lifted and for housing allowance to be further increased without action it warns the country will see rising homelessness heaped on top of an economic catastrophe another charity crisis said extending the ban was the obvious choice amid rising unemployment and future uncertainty jon sparkes crisis chief executive said ideally the ban should remain in place until well into next year but that if this does not happen the government must introduce other measures he told the pa news agency if we go back to precisely the same set of affairs set of circumstances and policies and financial support and legislation that we had pre - pandemic were going to get the same outcomes except they re going to be even worse because a lot of people are going to be impacted economically by the pandemic so this is one of the most worrying moments i think there s been a government spokesman said the government has taken unprecedented action to support renters preventing people getting into financial hardship and helping businesses to pay salaries meaning no tenants have been evicted at the height of the coronavirus pandemic we are working on how best to continue supporting renters and landlords during the pandemic and will make an announcement on the next steps shortly video report by itv news political correspondent carl dinnen hundreds of thousands of btec students have been left in the dark about when they will receive their exam results after they were delayed last night with the schools minister unable to guarantee the day they will be published nick gibb the minister for school standards told itv news he expects students will receive their grades next week but said this is a matter for pearson the exam board on wednesday evening hours before students were due to receive their results btec exam board pearson instructed schools to hold the results amid concerns about unfairness in the system pearson said it would work urgently to get the grades out to young people but did not but a timescale on when that might happen itv news political correspondent carl dinnen has more mr gibb says he told pearson the results should go out next week but he was unable to provide a guarantee that they will my expectation is that they will go out next week he added robert halfon the chair of the commons education select committee described the btec results delay as a mega mess and it should n't have happened a level pass rate hits all time high following grading u turn gcse results surge to record high after pupils given predicted grades the btec situation is pretty awful it 's symptomatic of the way we treat vocational qualifications in our country he said everyone has been obsessing about a levels very important but it btecs seem to have been forgotten in all of this it follows a fiasco over a level results which saw around 40 % of students have their grades downgraded before an extraordinary government u - turn which allowed pupils to use the grades teachers had predicted it resulted in this year 's a level students in england having a record high pass rate gcse students were spared the worry and confusion of waiting days for a u - turn after the government agreed it would give students whichever grade was highest teacher predicted or algorithm based following that decision this year a record number of pupils were awarded top grades in their gcses pearson 's senior vice president cindy rampersaud said the decision was taken to delay btec results in order to ensure fair outcomes for btec students in relation to a levels and gcses and that no btec student is disadvantaged students were unable to sit their exams this year due to the coronavirus crisis a spokesperson for pearson said following ofquals announcement that a level and gcse students are to receive centre assessed grades we will be applying the same principles for students receiving btec results this summer we will be regrading btecs to address concerns about unfairness in relation to a levels and gcses and ensure no btec student is disadvantaged on a levels it emerged that private school students were not as severely downgraded by the algorithm owing to an issue with small class sizes it meant students from less advantaged backgrounds were the worst affected in the results debacle mr gibb admitted only a small proportion of private school students will be affected by the btec results delay pearson took the decision that it was better to delay for a short period than not to have the fairest result possible pearson took the decision yesterday to look again at the grades of the btec to make sure that the adjustments that had been made to a levels and gcses did not put btecs at a disadvantage he said barack obama has delivered a stark and dramatic warning to americans our democracy is in immediate peril call this obama 's defcon 1 moment after four years of near silence america 's 44th president opened fire with everything he had and then some the protocol is that former american presidents do not publicly criticise the current occupant of the oval office along with the political norms that trump has shredded that tradition has overnight been ripped up as well obama our democracy is at stake barack obama was speaking on the third night of the democratic party 's virtual online convention significantly he delivered his grave warning not from washington dc where he lives or from delaware the home of joe biden he chose philadelphia the birthplace of american democracy and where the country 's foundational documents were composed obama did more than raise a red flag about what he perceives as trump 's reckless disregard for voting rights he directly warned that his successor would destroy democracy in order to win in november one of joe biden 's biggest tasks ahead of the election will be mobilising those who got behind barack obama when he was elected and also progressives says washington correspondent robert moore he went on in his primetime speech to lacerate president trump 's character and values saying that he has treated the awesome responsibility of his office to help only himself and his friends and as one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves" brutal stuff amid all of that the party 's vice presidential nominee introduced herself to the country senator kamala harris spoke of her immigrant background she lavished praise on joe biden and emphasized the stakes in november it was a polished impressive even emotional moment that will give democrats further hope that they can win the white house by recreating the obama voter coalition of 2008 and 2012 but it is obama 's warning that will dominate the headlines furthermore it is certain to trigger a fierce counter - assault from donald trump this election campaign is now up and running and it is being framed by democrats as the most important since the civil war barack obama returns to the stage with a key mission boost joe biden jill biden 's pitch to america joe can heal the nation the government 's rough sleeping adviser has unexpectedly stepped down as the country teeters on the brink of what charities are calling a potential homelessness crisis dame louise casey who was appointed to lead the rough sleeping taskforce in may told housing groups on wednesday she will be stepping back from the role with the ban on evictions due to end next week potentially putting hundreds of thousands of renters at risk of losing their homes ministers have been urged against a leadership vacuum key worker facing homelessness as government ban on evictions set to end homelessness charity crisis said it was concerned by the news which comes as the economic fall out of the coronavirus pandemic starts to bite chief executive jon sparkes said dame louise had made extraordinary progress adding we urge minsters not to leave a leadership vacuum with the economic impact of the pandemic pushing more people into homelessness we must redouble our efforts otherwise we risk rates of rough sleeping rising with all the human misery this entails thousands of homeless people including rough sleepers were rapidly brought in to safe accommodation at the start of the covid-19 outbreak as part of the government 's everyone in initiative it is understood the taskforce will continue but it is not clear whether a successor will be appointed to lead it discussions about what future advice and support dame louise can offer the government are ongoing communities secretary robert jenrick said i would like to thank dame louise for her contribution at such a challenging time which has led to so many rough sleepers being helped off the streets and kept safe from coronavirus her work leading the rough sleeping taskforce will ensure as many people as possible who have been brought in do not return to sleeping rough our plans for longer term accommodation 3,300 homes this year alone and tailored support backed by half a billion pounds of funding this year and next- will help us to meet our commitment to end rough sleeping once and for all thangam debbonaire labour 's shadow housing secretary said the departure of dame louise raises serious questions about the government 's strategy on rough sleeping she added this chaotic government has no plan to avoid a self made homelessness crisis this winter they need to extend the ban on evictions and come forward with a credible plan to keep their promise that no renter will lose their home because of coronavirus what next for homeless and vulnerable people housed during coronavirus lockdown video report by itv news correspondent damon green oldham is facing the very real threat of a full scale lockdown if its coronavirus cases do n't fall its council leader has confirmed comments from labour councillor sean fielding that the town is resisting a lockdown follow those of health secretary matt hancock who earlier warned oldham is posing the biggest challenge among greater manchester areas the north west town is the uk 's new coronavirus hotspot according to the latest data from the nhs and last week it narrowly avoided following leicester in being placed under strict lockdown speaking to itv news health secretary hancock refused to rule out a full lockdown for the town which would include a closure of some non - essential businesses no we do n't rule anything out of that kind in oldham or anywhere else in the country he said councillor fielding told a virtual press conference that a full lockdown is a very real threat for oldham make no mistake at all but we are resisting it strongly he said local lockdown would not be the right solution for the area potentially making the situation considerably worse in other ways mr fielding added the government has communicated with oldham council that it is genuinely considering a local lockdown mr fielding added its almost a frustration that the plans that we want to get on with delivering on in order to bring the infection rate down in the way that we need to were not running at full capacity with those because so much of our time has been spent having arguments with government and others about how we are opposed to local lockdown and we think that its the wrong thing oldham is among several northern local authorities which are currently under tighter restrictions compared with the rest of the country however most of those regions have managed to reduce their covid-19 infection rate andy burnham the mayor of greater manchester revealed the case rates for each part of the region which showed oldham 's is significantly higher than elsewhere oldham 's seven day infection rate per 100,000 is 83.1 the area with the nearest to that is manchester with 47.6 despite oldham clearly being the worst affected in the area mr burnham has written to the health secretary asking for no new restrictions to be placed on the town he also wants a relaxation of the ban on gatherings in wigan and for an opening of more businesses in all areas except oldham mr burnham recently told the sunday mirror that cases are flattening in most local authorities there with one exception oldham currently in oldham and many other northern regions people are advised not to meet with people they do not live with in any setting except public outdoor places unless a support bubble has been formed australia orders 25 million doses of oxford university coronavirus vaccine leicester lockdown nail bars salons and some outdoor venues to reopen from wednesday mr hancock said the government is working very closely day in day out with oldham which is the area within greater manchester that 's got the biggest challenge the biggest problem he said the government will do whatever is necessary to make sure that we keep this virus under control if you look at leicester where we brought in a local lockdown a few weeks ago yesterday we were able to announce that we 've lifted most of those measures because the virus is now under control in leicester these local lockdowns work he said adding how oldham will now receive extra support and he hopes that will bring down the case rate there two days ago a game of thrones actor lent his hand to oldham council in order to help the town avoid a further lockdown james cosmo who plays jeor mormont in the hit tv series recorded a video of himself warning lockdown is coming which was shared on twitter by oldham council in game of thrones style the actor said houses of oldham it 's your lord commander lockdown is coming if you do n't act now the health secretary said an expansion of the ons covid infection survey will allow us to further narrow down the areas potentially affected by local outbreaks and continue our fight to curb the spread ahead of winter political reporter shehab khan explains the situation in oldham the infection survey will be expanded from regularly testing 28,000 people per fortnight in england to 150,000 by october the health secretary said the expanded study will provide extensive weekly data on the spread of infection supporting rapid testing and diagnosis of covid-19 both nationally and in areas of concern the ons will prioritise ramping up of testing in the north west of england letters have been sent out to tens of thousands of homes inviting new participants to take part in the survey excellent experience matt hancock defends dido harding 's promotion to top of phe 's replacement mr hancock said i urge anyone who is able to take part in this study to do so you will be playing a vital role in the fight against the virus the data and insight gathered will help inform our national regional and local responses to the pandemic allowing this nation to get back to the things we love doing barack obama is set to make a powerful intervention on behalf of joe biden on wednesday obama has been a largely silent figure since he left the oval office to the disappointment of many but on wednesday night america 's 44th president will praise his former vice president and accuse donald trump of undermining us democracy with his assault on voting rights it comes as the party has formally nominated biden as its candidate an entertaining if slightly bizarre television extravaganza that merged presidential politics with the production values of a game show robert moore reports on the formal nomination of joe biden as the democratic candidate in the us election but hidden from view by party managers is the fact that the obama biden relationship is not straightforward biden was aggravated that obama put his weight behind hillary clinton four years ago obama is known to view biden as someone who has n't the focus or the intellectual self discipline to be president but in the era of trump all is forgiven and the party is swinging decisively behind biden for democrats america is facing an existential danger and there is no longer the time to engage in policy arguments or personality clashes so biden is emerging from this convention strengthened but no democrat should be complacent they felt confident four years ago and then their coalition of voters failed to turn out in key battleground states so the next two days are about boosting biden painting him as the indefatigable fighter for the little guy the nation 's healer in chief an empathetic figure who can unite america and about mobilising supporters 2020 election facebook attack ads why donald trump and joe biden are focused on one man and it 's not donald jill biden 's pitch to america joe can heal the nation the doomed algorithm used by ofqual which downgraded thousands of a level results was unlawful labour has claimed shadow attorney general lord falconer is arguing that both ministers and the exams regulator would have been aware that the algorithm was in breach of the law at least three times at least 40 % of a level results were downgraded from what teachers had predicted by a standardisation formula which assigned grades to students partially based on their previous attainment and on grades achieved by previous years at their school or college it meant a level results day was blighted for students across the country who had been expecting grades their teachers had predicted for them after the coronavirus crisis meant they could not sit their exams the government stood by whatboris johnsonsaid were robust results before it performed a u - turn allowing students to use the grades their teachers predicted for them lord falconer said the standardisation formula used to calculate grades was in breach of the objectives under which ofqual was established in 2009 disadvantaged pupils will find it impossible to catch up unless 2021 exams change neu warns in a joint letter with shadow education secretary kate green addressed to education secretary gavin williamson and chief regulator of ofqual sally collier lord falconer said the algorithm does not accurately reflect that students level of knowledge skill and understanding this is clearly not in compliance with objective one and therefore can not allow for a proper comparison with other boards or years because there is no proper assessment of this years students according to the law which established ofqual the apprenticeships skills children and learning act 2009 the regulator must secure that regulated qualifications give a reliable indication of knowledge skills and understanding the letter continues separately it is inherently unfair not to have any right of appeal against the grade awarded beyond errors of application in the system they should have the right to complain they were wrongly graded on the merits the decision is so important to their life chances that is a second unlawfulness there will be a mass of discriminatory impacts by operating the process on the basis of reflecting the previous years results from their institutions gavin get gone angry students demand education secretary 's resignation btec results delayed over unfairness concerns less than 24 hours before grades due out a level u - turn what happens now for students and what about university places it is bound to disadvantage a whole range of groups with protected characteristics in breach of a range of anti - discrimination legislation that is a third unlawfulness earlier the department for education said it had full confidence in exams regulator ofqual despite education secretary williamson on tuesday appearing to shift blame for thea levelsresults fiasco onto the watchdog mr williamson on tuesday said ofqual did n't deliver after hundreds of thousands of a level students were left disappointed by their results which were downgraded by an algorithm but ahead of gcse results day on thursday the dfe said we have full confidence in ofqual and its leadership in their role as independent regulator and we continue to work closely with ofqual to deliver fair results for our young people at this unprecedented time it added our focus remains on working with ofqual to ensure students receive their final gcse as level and a level results this week so that they can move on to the next stage of their lives it will be almost impossible for disadvantaged children to catch up with their peers in their gcses and a levels in the upcoming school year unless bigger changes are made to the exams process the national education union neu has warned the majority of gcse and a level students will have been out of schooling for more than five months when they return in september however children from more advantaged backgrounds are more likely to have had access to various forms of education while outside of school dr mary bousted the joint general secretary of the neu told itv news that disadvantaged children who have not had access to the internet or laptops or tutoring during the coronavirus crisis will find it almost impossible to catch up through no fault of their own she said her union is concerned that the education attainment gap between the more advantaged pupils and less advantaged pupils will be wider unless gcses and a levels are altered to reflect that reality the neu is demanding a reduction in the amount of content assessed in 2021s gcse and a level exams it wants the government to work with teachers to develop a robust system for moderated centre assessed grades and commission an independent review into the assessment methods for gcses and a levels the neu is concerned that future local lockdowns could result in schools being forced to close a situation that would disproportionately affect disadvantaged children in a joint letter to the education secretary dr bousted and joint general secretary kevin courtney urged education secretary gavin williamson to prepare for new spikes in coronavirus that could lead to further loss of schooling they said the controversy around last weeks a level results must never happen again and are demanding changes to exams in 2021 which ensure grades properly recognise and reward in the letter they said it is clear to the national education union that government needs to make much bigger changes to next years exams in order to build confidence that the grades awarded upon which young peoples life chances are determined properly recognise and reward their achievements you should be working now to examine different possible scenarios and to develop contingency plans in case of further school and college closures they added the current over reliance on end of course exams increases student anxiety and fails to give a fair reflection of what students can achieve all options should be considered to ensure that young people are rewarded for their achievements supported to fulfil their potential and not held back due to their background it comes after the department for education has said it has full confidence in exams regulator ofqual ahead of gcse results day on thursday despite mr williamson on tuesday appearing to shift blame for the a levels results fiasco onto the watchdog mr williamson on tuesday said ofqual did n't deliver after hundreds of thousands of a level students were left disappointed by their results which were downgraded by an algorithm but as gcse students await their results the dfe said we have full confidence in ofqual and its leadership in their role as independent regulator and we continue to work closely with ofqual to deliver fair results for our young people at this unprecedented time the government stood by what boris johnson said were robust results before it performed a u - turn allowing students to use the grades their teachers predicted for them since then it has been announced that gcse students will not have their results downgraded when they are revealed on thursday the dfe said the ofqual decision to move from moderated grades to centre assessed grades was one that we agreed with it added our focus remains on working with ofqual to ensure students receive their final gcse as level and a level results this week so that they can move on to the next stage of their lives gavin get gone angry students demand education secretary 's resignation the statement signals a change in tack from mr williamson who in a series of interviews on tuesday suggested the exams watchdog was to blame for the a levels debacle when asked on lbc radio if ofqual had failed mr williamson said we ended up in a situation where ofqual did nt deliver the system that we had been reassured and believed that would be in place labour shadow university minister emma hardy said said it was completely unfair to throw ofqual under the bus to hide their own incompetence she said the government should have scrutinised the assurances it was given by ofqual about its calculation process the very idea that they just took reassurances and shrugged and said ok that 's fine and waited for the catastrophe to happen is frankly appalling in order to save gcse students facing a similar situation mr williamson has said youngsters will receive whatever grade is highest either the grades predicted by their teachers or the algorithm based result fred dimblebywill be analysing the2020 us electiondigital campaigns for our new podcast will trump win here he looks at how the candidates are facing off on facebook and why they 're both talking about one man after the furore in the aftermath of the 2016 us election facebook google and even snapchat started ad libraries which track ads posted on those sites they give us a real time insight into what lines the candidates are trying to push online and allow us to open up the brain of the campaigns and see what is going on will trump win listen to the latest episode below and subscribe on apple podcasts or spotify what jumps out at you immediately is just how much donald trump is spending on ads and how many accounts he is publishing those ads from there are ads published from his account from mike pence 's account from the team trump account from the team trump store account where you can purchase all your trump merchandise in total he advertises from 12 accounts and just in the last 30 days has bought over 70,000 ads costing more than $ 21 million 19 million in comparison joe biden has been advertising from just two accounts over that period publishing 11,000 ads costing $ 11 million 10 million biden has spent more in recent weeks but still lags far behind his opponent what stands out about the ads one person dominates both democrat and republican ads joe biden both campaigns are spending millions on defining who this veteran politician really is and what he represents trump publishes ads filled with vitriolic attacks about biden and his supporters one even says that bidens backers are anarchists who will destroy our country doing its best to paint the base of this 77-year old centrist democrat as extremists trump also uses the language of the culture war publicising incendiary debates to present his opponents as wanting to take away rights and freedoms from his supporters it creates this awkward double attack of joe biden being sleepy joe while also having violent supporters wanting to radically change america two people appear less often in donald trumps ads the first is kamala harris the trump campaign have struggled to frame their attack line on bidens new running mate and it shows in the online advertising while there is the usual language of phony and radical there is little specific marketing about the presumptive democrat vice presidential nominee the other person missing is trump himself there are ads of his speeches and him saluting in slow motion but there are only a small number purely focused on the president people know who trump is and what he represents so the campaign seems to be directing its efforts on painting a negative portrayal of the opposition rather than defining themselves the biden campaign is attempting to do the opposite trump rarely features while thousands of ads focus on the branding of team joe despite the veteran nature of their candidate the campaign attempts to paint the biden / harris ticket as an underdog grassroots choice the message is that trump has more money a big support base and a real chance of winning biden 's ads are plainer and somewhat less eye catching than his opponents but they are all about his own image the campaign has even spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on ads of biden simply serving ice cream or driving classic cars in both campaigns policy plays second fiddle to personality how have things changed since 2016 the most significant change from the last election is that we can now see in real time what the campaigns are publishing online and how much they are spending in 2016 few knew exactly what was being spent online but now a publicly accessible tool exists to track all those ads both campaigns also now realise the importance of campaigning online something that the clinton campaign in 2016 did not commit to fully trump was ahead of the game in the last election and his campaigns realisation of the importance of online advertising and targeting helped him on polling day these ads not only help the campaigns raise support but also allow them to collect the data that is vital to a successful election run both trump and biden post poll after poll competition after competition all with the aim of adding names addresses and contact details to their voter targeting operations these surveys go to extreme lengths to encourage viewers to hand over their personal information some of trumps ads ask voters to sign a defend the second amendment petition while in one of bidens people are given the opportunity to add their names to a list wishing happy birthday to barack obama what lessons have been learnt the democrats lost out on facebook in 2016 and focused on more traditional forms of advertising they are trying not to repeat that mistake they re spending more and publishing many more ads online than four years ago the lack of a successful digital blueprint does set them back but it also means that they can afford to take risks online trumps campaign meanwhile is sticking to the winning formula that put their candidate in the white house spend and attack they start from a stronger base but may find it harder to innovate with a fear of diverting from the plan that was so successful last time one shared aspect in these campaigns is that desire to define a vision of joe biden trump is painting him as a risk and a radical biden seeks to define himself as a trusted pair of hands the calculation for both campaigns is simple convince more voters that their picture of biden is most accurate will trump win podcast join us every week for insight and exclusive interviews on donald trump 's battle with joe biden the belarusian opposition leader has urged european leaders to support the awakening of beirut as a coordination council formed by the opposition push for a new election in a video statement released ahead of wednesdays emergency summit of eu leaders sviatlana tsikhanouskaya called on leaders not to recognise fraudulent elections that extended the rule of authoritarian president alexander lukashenko mr lukashenko has lost all the legitimacy in the eyes of our nation and the world she said ms tsikhanouskaya a 37-year old former english teacher who united fractured opposition groups and drew tens of thousands to rally in her support got only 10 % she dismissed the results as falsified and demanded a recount but then suddenly left the country for lithuania in a move her campaign said was made under duress earlier this week she said she was ready to act as a national leader to facilitate a rerun of the election and her associates announced the formation of a co - ordination council to help create a platform for a peaceful transition of power i have initiated the national co - ordination council of belarus it will lead the process of a peaceful transition of power via dialogue it will immediately call for new fair and democratic presidential elections with international supervision ms tsikhanouskaya said in the latest video statement mr lukashenko who has run the ex - soviet nation of 9.5 million with an iron fist since 1994 won his sixth term with 80 % of votes in the august 9 election but it was widely seen as rigged he repeatedly rejected demands to step down and bristled at the idea of talks with the opposition denouncing the co - ordination council as a an attempt to seize power mr lukashenko blasted the opposition again on wednesday for creating alternative government bodies and warned them they may be prosecuted for it if someone thinks that the government bent down and teetered you re mistaken he said at a meeting with security officials we will not waver hundreds of thousands of people have protested in belarus since august 9 the rallies have continued for 10 straight days despite a brutal response from the police who in the first four days detained almost 7,000 people and injured hundreds with rubber bullets stun grenades and clubs at least two protesters died this week workers at several major industrial plants including a huge factory that accounts for a fifth of the worlds potash fertiliser output have started a strike demanding mr lukashenko resign western officials refused to recognise the election as free or fair and criticised the violent crackdown foreign secretary dominic raab said the uk does not accept the result of the belarus presidential election mr raab said the vote was fraudulent and condemned the violence from the belarusian authorities as they attempted to crack down on the protests the eu is preparing a list of belarus officials who could be blacklisted in europe over their roles in a letter inviting leaders of the bloc to the teleconference eu council president charles michel said what we have witnessed in belarus is not acceptable adding that the violence against peaceful protesters was shocking and has to be condemned those responsible must be held to account i will never cave in to pressure belarus president alexander lukashenko jeered by angry workers as strikes grow uk does not accept result of belarus election dominic raab says belarus protesters attend largest gathering in country 's history as they demand president resigns population wide mass testing for coronavirus is being planned the health secretary has said matt hancock said ministers are working as fast as we can to achieve the moonshot of mass testing so restrictions can be eased some have called for a mass testing regime to be adopted to keep levels of covid-19 in check mr hancock told itv news we want to see a huge expansion of testing the survey where we test people to find out where the virus is that survey is expanding by 10 times so we have much more detail granular localised understanding of where the virus is spreading it 's our single most important piece of information that comes out each week in terms of how the virus is progressing and how we are keeping a lid on it it 's been such an important tool in the decision making that we 're expanding it massively this means that we 'll be able to spot an area that 's had a rise in cases that might need a local lockdown to spot that earlier and be able to have a more focused response he earlier told bbc radio 4 the new technologies for testing that are coming on stream now are incredibly important at the moment you have to send off a test to a laboratory and get it back and all the logistics of that takes time its also quite expensive were testing some of these right now in porton down in our scientific labs and the mass testing population testing where we make it the norm that people get tested regularly allowing us therefore to allow some of the freedoms back is a huge project in government right now with enormous support test and trace system defended amid claims it is nowhere near world beating local tracing teams far more successful than call centres and online check coronavirus cases in your area with our interactive map but when pressed on the issue mr hancock declined to say when mass testing would be available were ramping it up over the remainder of this year i m not going to put a firm deadline on it the answer is were working as fast as we can he said this moonshot to have testing ubiquitous and available to reopen all sorts of things to reduce the burden of the quarantine arrangements which nobody wants to have in place to allow us to reopen parts of the economy that is an incredibly important project within government right now it has been suggested that routine mass testing could see a return of packed sports stadiums and live music events with other parts of society able to operate more safely initial testing capabilities would not have been able to cope with a population wide programme with some tests taking days to be returned but the recent introduction of rapid tests some providing results in as little as 90 minutes have changed the way tests can be delivered mr hancock was speaking as the government faced criticism for axing the public health body in england in the middle of the pandemic critics have expressed dismay public health england phe is being dismantled during the crisis but mr hancock said delaying the change would have been wrong the new national institute for

baroness dido harding despite a perceived lack of success as the executive chair of nhs test and trace baroness harding has been appointed the interim leader of new health agency the national

building that from scratch into what is now one of the biggest testing and diagnostics organisations in the world he said nhs test and trace has been widely criticised under her leadership with it consistently failing to reach thousands of people potentially carrying coronavirus matt hancock defends baroness dido harding 's promotion the system which has been blighted with failings since it was set up including its abandoned app has often been described by opponents as not good enough and ministers have admitted it needs improving since its inception the programme which aims to instruct self isolation for people who may have been in close contact with the virus has been unable to reach around 18.5 % 48,625 of close contacts aside from her experience in the nhs mr hancock said baroness harding has excellent experience externally where she has run very large organisations she was previously the chief executive of telecoms company talktalk where she twice won the daily mail wooden

social media criticised her appointment saying it showed nepotism within the tory party baroness harding was given a seat in the house of lords in 2014 by her friend and then pm david cameron and is married to tory mp john penrose liberal democrat leadership contender layla moran said the appointment was appalling and said it is undermining the reputation of this new agency before it has even

next six weeks as a ban on evictions during the coronavirus pandemic comes to an end nichola mcclean is one of the thousands of private renters set to be impacted as the emergency legislation expires housing charity shelter has warned after being furloughed ms mcclean fell behind on her rent though she 's back at work and paying rent plus arrears she 's been served with an eviction notice i do n't know what i 'm going to do she told itv news i have to find a home i can not afford for us to be put in emergency accommodation it 's devastating according to shelter up to 230,000 tenants could be at risk of similar evictions at the end of the august once the ban is lifted approximately 3 % of private renters some 227,000 people have fallen into arrears during the coronavirus pandemic the charity warned emergency legislation to suspend new evictions from social or private rented accommodation during emergency was introduced in march but the eviction ban is to end on august 23 putting thousands of tenants who have fallen behind on their rent at risk under current legislation anyone who accrues rent arrears of eight weeks or more can be automatically evicted shelter says that unless the government acts to protect renters thrown into financial difficulty by covid-19 judges will be powerless to stop them from losing their homes once the ban lifts shelter 's chief executive polly neate said the housing secretary promised no one would lose their home because of coronavirus but the financial chaos of covid-19 means that many private renters are in danger of being evicted when the current ban lifts unless he acts now he will break his promise and put thousands of renters at risk of homelessness we know people have been doing whatever they can to pay their rent and keep their home safe despite this the minute the evictions ban lifts the 230,000 already behind with their rent could be up for automatic eviction if they ve built up eight weeks worth of arrears and judges will be powerless to help them that s more than the entire population of portsmouth at risk of losing their homes and lets not forget this pandemic is not over following a yougov survey shelter claim 174,000 private tenants have already been threatened with eviction by their landlord or letting agent shelter found nearly a third of renters 2.7 million adults 31 % feel more depressed and anxious about their housing situation and the same number say they are having sleepless nights ms neate added the housing secretary can still avert this disaster he can prevent these covid evictions as the pandemic continues and keep families safe in their homes all he and the government need to do in the 10 sitting days before parliament breaks for the summer is make some small changes to the law these changes would give judges the power to ensure that no renter is automatically evicted and the impact of coronavirus is always considered chris norris policy director for the national residential landlords association said:"extending the ban on repossessions is not necessary changes to court rules will ensure landlords have to account for the impact of covid on their tenants if this information is not forthcoming or is deemed inadequate judges will have powers to adjourn cases such a delay would mean that the landlord may continue to receive no rent from the tenant as we are already seeing in the vast majority of cases this will encourage landlords to engage with their tenants prior to court action including seeking ways to sustain tenancies using the nrla 's rent arrears management guidance he added that courts should be kept clear to deal with cases of tenants committing anti - social behaviour or where there are long standing rent arrears that have nothing to do with the pandemic a spokesperson for the ministry of housing communities and local government said the government has taken unprecedented action to support renters during the pandemic including providing financial support to enable tenants to pay their living expenses and their rent and this has helped ensure no one was forced from their home new court rules will provide appropriate support to those who have been particularly affected by coronavirus when court proceedings start again with landlords required to set out information about a tenants circumstances including the effect of the pandemic on a tenants vulnerability when bringing a possession claim were committed to breaking the cycle of homelessness and to ending rough sleeping for good that s why we changed the law so councils now have a duty to try to stop people from becoming homeless and have provided over half a billion pounds to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping in 2020 and 2021 thousands of homeless back on the streets by july ' calls for better support for homeless shelters and food banks amid coronavirus outbreak kent county council has reached its capacity to care for asylum seeking children arriving on its shores its leader has said the council issued a statement quoting roger gough as saying i am deeply disappointed and concerned that despite our many efforts to avoid this unthinkable

dangerous he said the limit had been reached despite efforts to work with the home office and other local authorities it later emerged that wew unaccompanied migrant children arriving in dover will no longer be taken in by kent county council instead they will remain in the care of uk border force at dover until they can be transferred into the care of another uk local authority with capacity to safely care for them the council told the pa news agency on monday mr gough warned on august 12 the council was just days away from reaching capacity with about 420 unaccompanied migrant children arriving in kent this year and more than 100 expected in august a monthly figure not seen since the last major migrant crisis in 2015 on monday mr gough said the stark reality today is that despite my conversations with the home office alerting them that kent expected to reach safe capacity to meet its statutory duty of care this weekend 13 new arrivals in the last 2 days has now tipped the balance and the council simply can not safely accommodate any more new arrivals at this time while adult migrants and families landing on kents shores are sent to other parts of the country the council retains responsibility for unaccompanied children unaccompanied children arriving in kent remained in the councils care system for quite a number of years mr gough told the pa news agency last week this puts additional pressure on the councils wider childrens social services who are also responsible for looking after young people local to kent he added in a statement a home office spokesman said this is an unprecedented situation and we have been working incredibly closely with kent county council to urgently address their concerns we continue to provide kent county council with a high level of support such as significantly increasing funding and reducing pressure on their services through a national transfer scheme we are also providing extra support with childrens services and we

election as protests continued against the rule of alexander lukashenko foreign secretary dominic raab said the vote was fraudulent and condemned the violence from the belarusian authorities as they attempted to crack down on the protests mr raabs comments come as thousands of factory workers in belarus took to the streets and crowds of demonstrators besieged the state television headquarters following the august 9 result belarus protesters attend largest gathering in country 's history as they demand president resigns the foreign secretary called for an independent investigation by the organisation for security and co - operation in europe osce he said the world has watched with horror at the violence used by the belarusian authorities to suppress the peaceful protests that followed this fraudulent presidential election the uk does not accept the results we urgently need an independent investigation through the osce into the flaws that rendered the election unfair as well as the grisly repression that followed the uk will work with our international partners to sanction those responsible and hold the belarusian authorities to account mr lukashenko has ruled the ex - soviet nation with an iron fist since 1994 repressing opposition figures and independent news organisations he has rejected any possibility of repeating the vote that gave him a sixth term lashing out at the west and declaring his country will perish as a state if the election is rerun on the ninth straight day of protests against the official results of presidential vote lukashenko flew by helicopter to a factory in the capital in a bid to rally support but was heckled by workers chanting go away facing the angry crowd the 65-year old former state farm director dismissed the calls to step down i will never cave in to pressure lukashenko told the workers saying those who intend to go on strike could leave if they want there will be no new election until you kill me he shouted charging that the protests are ruining the economy and warning that the country will collapse if he steps down as he spoke over 5,000 striking workers from the minsk tractor works plant marched down the streets of the city demanding that mr lukashenko cede his post to sviatlana tsikhanouskaya the leading opposition candidate lukashenko is a former president he needs to go said sergei dylevsky the leader of the protest at the minsk tractor plant adding that tsikhanouskaya is our president legitimate and elected by the people the official results of the august 9 vote gave mr lukashenko 80 % of the votes and mr tsikhanouskaya only 10 % but the opposition claimed the vote was rigged mr tsikhanouskaya has said protocols from precincts around the country showed her winning 60 - 70 % of the vote a brutal crackdown on protesters in the wake of sundays vote has left nearly 7,000 people detained and hundreds injured as police dispersed the crowds of peaceful demonstrators with stun grenades rubber

candidate flees country amid protests ' europe 's last dictator who is belarus president alexander lukashenko the first big pre - election moment is upon us the democratic party national convention starts on monday night the opening shot of a campaign that will be unique in the tumultuous history of american presidential politics never before has the us tried to organise an election amid a raging pandemic both parties have been forced to abandon plans for their traditional extravagant theatrical and triumphalist party gatherings milwaukee the city in wisconsin that lies on the shores of lake michigan famous for its beer and german american heritage was meant to be hosting thousands of democratic party activists this week instead the convention has become a virtual online event that will be organised around a series of recorded and live video feeds from across america on monday millions of americans will listen on tv and online to speeches from bernie sanders and michelle obama trying to reach beyond a traditional audience soundbites and images will be aggressively pushed out on social media platforms to create viral moments party bosses want to amplify the message to voters already exhausted by the public health crisis and the partisan political atmosphere later in the week we will hear from bill clinton barack obama and of course kamala harris and joe biden sanders ' role is important because there is the question of whether his young radical supporters will really swing behind biden the answer probably because they loathe trump but with zero enthusiasm for biden kamala harris posts first video and prepares to break through america 's racial and gender barriers michelle has box office appeal among democratic voters many of whom will wish she was running not biden her memorable line at the convention four years ago still resonates when they go low we go high she has recently confessed that she is suffering from depression because of the trump presidency wisconsin is the ultimate midwestern battleground state in 2016 trump won here by less than 23,000 votes a victory of less that one percent after 48 hours of talking to wisconsinites this much is clear to me the biden harris ticket can not take voters from granted we have found no one enthusiastic about biden many people told us that they would vote for him but only as a negative judgment on president trump and even harris is viewed with scepticism young black activists told me that they are deeply suspicious of her background as a prosecutor they claim she was pro - police while attorney general in california and put too many blacks behind bars for petty offences so wisconsin is an early warning sign for democrats they will need to fight for every vote that effort begins now kamala harris and joe biden campaign as running mates for first time kamala harris who is the woman joe biden has chosen as his running mate in the 2020 us election video report by correspondent neil connery

chanting his nickname of batka or father and maidan wo n't take place referring to the months of protest in ukraine in 2013 - 14 that drove then president viktor yanukovych to flee the country now

supporter tamara yurshevich a 35-year old lawyer on saturday demonstrators rallied at the spot in minsk where a protester died this week in clashes with police some male protesters pulled off their shirts to show bruises they said came from police beatings and others carried pictures of loved ones beaten so badly they could not attend the rally belarus ' declining economy and mr lukashenko 's dismissal of the coronavirus pandemic as psychosis are among the factors that galvanized the largest and most sustained protests the country has seen in response the president declared that russian leader vladimir putin had agreed to provide security assistance to restore order if belarus requested it as he struggled to counter the biggest challenge yet to his 26 years in power mr luksahenko known as europe 's last dictator did not specify what sort of assistance russia would be willing to provide but he said when it comes to the military component we have an agreement with the russian federation referring to a mutual support deal the two former soviet republics signed back in the 1990s these are the moments that fit this agreement he added mr lukashenkovs main opponent in the vote

coronavirus crisis after reports public health england phe is to be broken up the covid-19 response work of phe is to be merged with nhs test and trace to form a new body designed specifically to deal with pandemics according to the sunday telegraph other aspects of its operations such as tackling obesity could be handed over to councils and family doctors the paper said scientists and nhs trusts said if ministers are unhappy with phes performance they have only themselves blame as it is directly under ministerial control according to the sunday telegraph health secretary matt hancock is to announce a new institute for health protection will become effective from next month although the merger will take until next spring to complete students taking legal action against exam regulator ofqual amid a level results anger it comes amid repeated reports ministers have been frustrated with phe with boris johnson complaining of the countrys sluggish response to covid-19 a comment widely thought to have been aimed at the organisation chris hopson the chief executive of nhs providers representing nhs trusts said years of underfunding for phe and public health more generally have left the country unprepared to deal with a pandemic he said unlike other health bodies such as nhs england phe which replaced the health protection agency hpa in 2013 under the conservatives nhs reorganisation an executive agency of the department of health and social care this gives ministers direct control of its activities he said so whilst it might be convenient to seek to blame phes leadership team it is important that the government reflect on its responsibilities as well his comments were echoed by dr amitava banerjee associate professor at the institute of health informatics university college london who said the move is a huge concern in the midst of a global health crisis if phe has fallen short responsibility lies firmly with the current government and health ministers he said rather than a rash restructuring a sensible approach must involve a rapid enquiry to establish lessons learned for future waves and future pandemics search for brothers missing off lancashire coast stood down professor dame til wykes of the institute of psychiatry psychology and neuroscience kings college london said merging phe with a failing track and trace service does not provide much confidence for the future phe has had a 40 % decrease in its budget so carving it up will just mean too little resource spread even further she said producing this disruption in the middle of a pandemic is a complete diversion dr michael head a senior research fellow in global health at the university of southampton poured scorn on suggestions baroness harding the conservative peer and former talktalk telecoms boss who heads track and trace could head up the new body he said the idea makes about as much sense as chief medical officer chris whitty being appointed the vodafone head of branding and corporate image and dr chaand nagpaul british medical association council chairman said we already have public health expertise in this country which is of the highest quality but despite the hard work of our colleagues in the last six months substantial budget cuts and fragmentation of these services over years have hampered the response to the covid-19 pandemic we must absolutely not allow phe and its staff to shoulder the blame for wider failings and government decisions public health england should be part of a fully integrated public health and nhs both locally and nationally we also believe that public health doctors must be able to voice their views and policies independently in the interests of the publics health and without ministerial constraints with more than 1,000 new uk cases of covid-19 being recorded for the fifth day in a row we must seriously question whether now is the right time for undertaking such a seemingly major restructure and detract from the very immediate need to respond to the pandemic a department of health and social care spokesman said public health england have played an integral role in our national response to this unprecedented global pandemic we have always been clear that we must learn the right lessons from this crisis to ensure that we are in the strongest possible position both as we continue to deal with covid-19 and to

launching legal action against englands exam regulator ofqual thousands of teenagers were left angered after almost 40 % of predicted grades were downgraded by the regulators moderation algorithm leaving many missing out on their first choice universities the good law project is supporting six students over a judicial review of ofquals failings data from ofqual shows independent schools saw an increase of 4.7 % in the number of students securing a or a * grades from 2019 compared to 2 % for state schools and just 0.3 percentage points for further education colleges one of the students whose name was given as michael saw his grades fall from a predicted bbb to eee which left him disheartened michael said teachers are entrusted with the task of predicting students grades and considering they are in a far better position to determine what level students are working at it is abysmal to think that the government whose job it is to lead this country in the right direction has allowed an algorithm to determine the futures of thousands of students this injustice can not and should not stand and we are urging the government to rethink this decision the good law projects crowdfunding bid to cover legal costs has reached more than 41,000 ofqual suspends policy on a level mock exam appeals what to expect from universities this year teachers blamed for implausibly high predictions as a level row deepens jolyon maugham director of the good law project said if you do nt go to a successful school you do nt deserve to succeed either strip away all the science and that s what s delivered by the system ofqual and gavin williamson have put in place its not fair its not good enough and hard working students should not have to stand for it student curtis parfitt ford has launched a legal bid against ofqual to force them to come up with a fairer system despite getting the grades he was predicted he said he could not stand by and watch his friends and cohort getting the grades they do nt deserve which in turn made his grades meaningless mr parfitt ford spoke to itv news about ofqual 's decision to suspend guidance on students hoping to challenge their grades his crowdfunding page has amassed more than 15,000 in donations in less than two days and he is being represented by a legal team with lawyers from leigh day and foxglove the government is playing politics with our futures the 18-year old from ealing west london said whatever happens this is going to affect thousands of students in a 22-page letter to ofqual mr parfitt fords legal team described the model used to determine grades as irrational arbitrary fails to take account of relevant considerations and claimed it was unlawful on saturday just hours after it published its criteria for appeals based on mock exam results ofqual said the policy was being reviewed by its board and that further information would be released in due course this latest turn of events has been met with confusion and dismay among students and families mr parfitt ford described the now suspended appeals process as ridiculous and insane but said he was glad that it was being reviewed i wish they did it before releasing the policy in the first place he added we are desperately trying to get clarity with gcse results due we fear this could potentially become even more chaotic we are desperately hoping the government will make a u - turn by then we are not going to stand by and watch as potentially millions of gcse students futures are affected by this dan rosenberg an education lawyer at simpson millar who is representing several a level students said we have been overwhelmed by enquiries from others in a similar position all of them speak of the emotional distress and uncertainty that this has caused we would urge the government to act quickly to resolve this matter and to make sure that those who are still awaiting their gcse results later this week do not have to suffer in the same way geoff barton general secretary of the association of school and college leaders said he was not surprised by the students decision to take legal action they are high stakes qualifications and there have clearly been injustices in the way that teacher assessed grades have been moderated down by a statistical algorithm he added appeals over grades will be free for schools in england says williamson they 're

the whole of 2019 uk in talks with france to prevent upsurge in migrant channel crossings migrant crossings bad stupid dangerous and criminal thing to do says prime minister boris johnson the home office confirmed 89 migrants crossed into the uk on thursday on five boats as well as 48 others who arrived in four boats on friday it comes after immigration minister chris philip promised a new comprehensive action plan to stem the latest surge in crossings after talks with french officials in paris on tuesday meanwhile the ministry of defence mod responded to the home offices formal request for help by sending in raf planes three have been sent up into the skies above the channel this week so far to carry out surveillance and help the coastguard and border force spot emerging crossing

declaration of maritime war during an interview with french broadcasters home secretary priti patel had pledged to make the crossing an infrequent phenomenon and has now promised to make route completely unviable bella sankey director of detention action accused ms patel of playing politics with peoples lives as the crossings continue particularly as many boats include several children some of whom are too young to walk she said the mishandling of this situation continues and now the home secretary is nakedly playing politics with peoples lives and the uks proud tradition of providing

patel 's migrant crossing stance dan omahoney the home offices newly appointed clandestine channel threat commander reiterated warnings the crossings were dangerous and unnecessary adding i have already met the french and reaffirmed our joint commitment to stopping these crossings and making this route totally unviable i will continue to work with the french to tackle the criminals behind the

mind he has chosen his running mate and is set to announce it within the next 48 hours possibly later today and it matters vastly more than usual if he wins in november which the polls predict then biden will be by some distance the oldest president ever elected in fact he would be older at the start of his presidency than ronald reagan was at the end of his two terms for that reason from day one biden 's running mate will be seen as a possible president will trump win listen to the brand new itv news us election podcast if biden does n't survive his first term or steps aside for health reasons then the person he is about to pick as his partner in the white house will become america 's 47th president no wonder the country is watching the choice so closely will trump win podcast 2016 called to say write donald trump off at your peril we do not know who he will pick it is the best kept secret in american politics right now though dozens of journalists are tracking the movement of private jets into delaware to try and get the scoop but we do know for sure that it will be a woman biden has long promised his party that there will be gender diversity on the ticket that is in no small part because of disappointment among many democrats during the primaries earlier this year the party had lined up a wonderfully diverse and fresh field of candidates to select the presidential nominee only for party voters to go for an old white man who 's been around washington for fifty years there is still suspense over the question of whether biden will choose a woman of colour which would break a glass ceiling in the world of presidential politics two black women are widely considered front runners senator kamala harris her father was jamaican her mother was from india and susan rice who was obama 's national security adviser but some within the party are pushing the case for a white women notably elizabeth warren the progressive senator from massachusetts and gretchen whitmer the governor of the key midwestern battleground state of michigan us political analysts always argue about whether a vp pick makes a difference does it actually persuade any undecided voters to change their mind there is scant empirical evidence though perhaps lbj helped kennedy win the white house in 1960 by securing texas this time the decision could be truly significant biden is

countrys foreign minister linas linkevicius made the statement on twitter on tuesday it comes after sviatlana tsikhanouskaya refused to concede defeat in sundays vote and dismissed the official results showing authoritarian president alexander lukashenkos landslide victory as a sham she submitted her formal demand for a recount to belarus central election commission on monday president lukashenko vows to crack down on protesters after disputed result thousands of opposition supporters protested against the official vote results facing a tough police crackdown in minsk and several other cities on monday a protester died amid the clashes in minsk and scores were injured as police used tear gas flash bang grenades and rubber bullets to disperse the demonstrators interior ministry spokesman alexander lastovsky said the victim intended to throw an explosive device but it blew up in his hand and killed him mr lukashenko who has led the ex - soviet nation of 9.5-million with an iron fist since 1994 derided the opposition as sheep manipulated by foreign masters election officials said mr lukashenko won a sixth term in office with 80 % of the vote while ms tsikhanouskaya got 10 % after submitting her recount request on monday ms tsikhanouskaya said i have made a decision i must be with my children she had earlier sent her children to an unspecified european country after receiving threats europe 's last dictator who is belarus president alexander lukashenko immigration minister chris philp is to hold talks with french counterparts in paris in an attempt to stem a fresh upsurge in migrants crossing the channel in small boats the government has been facing increasing pressure from conservative mps after fine weather and calm seas saw hundreds take to the water in an attempt to reach the uk more than 4,000 migrants have made it so far this year after completing the dangerous voyage across the worlds busiest shipping lane with at least 597 arriving between thursday and sunday boris johnson on monday condemned the activities of the cruel criminal gangs who were putting lives at risk taking people out in potentially unseaworthy vessels home secretary priti patel who went to see for herself the border force operations at dover said the uk authorities now needed to work with the french to make the route unviable the number of illegal small boat crossings we have seen recently is totally unacceptable she said 20 syrian migrants intercepted by border force off coast of dover our operational partners are dealing with complex challenges associated with them and collectively with the french we need make this route unviable across government we are absolutely committed to shutting down this route and we will bring down the criminal gangs that facilitate these illegal crossings officials said that they wanted to build on the joint work already under way exploring the options for tougher action in france including stronger enforcement measures interceptions at sea and the direct return of boats migrants must be returned to france ' says patel after record set for channel crossings however the government was facing criticism from french politicians after the home office formally requested the assistance of the royal navy to deal with the problem calais mp pierre henri dumont said it was a political measure intended to show ministers were taking action but warned that it wo nt change anything meanwhile downing street has suggested leaving the eu would allow the uk to draw up a new framework for dealing with migrants ending the inflexible and rigid requirements to ensure asylum applications are examined and considered in further move to show ministers were serious about dealing with the issue an raf atlas a400 m surveillance aircraft was deployed over the channel on monday with spotters on board to support the border force operation children among record number of migrants found crossing channel the latest outcry follows a similar storm last summer when another upsurge in crossings led mr johnson to warn britain was prepared to start sending back those migrants who did make it across ms patel met the then french interior minister christophe castaner in paris on august 29 last year when they agreed to step up resources to intercept and stop the wave of crossings there were suggestions from the french side that the uk could put more money into efforts to tackle the problem reinforcing its patrols and improving the effectiveness of the three border force cutters stationed in the channel it followed an earlier plan drawn up under former home secretary sajid javid including a 6 million investment in security equipment cctv coverage of beaches and ports and a mutual commitment to return migrants under international and domestic laws in the latest attempt to address the issue ms patel last month hailed a new operational approach after reaching an agreement with newly appointed french interior minister gerald darmanin to create a franco british intelligence cell mr philp also discussed the problem with the french deputy ambassador francois revardeaux in a meeting last week video report by itv news political correspondent carl dinnen boris johnson says he understands the anxiety felt by pupils waiting for results after exams were cancelled while nicola sturgeon has apologised to students over scotland 's handling of the issue the prime minister said he was very keen to get back to normal assessments in the coming school year students have been marked based on predicted grades given by their teachers rather than the more traditional exams which were cancelled due to coronavirus we did not get this right sturgeon apologises after criticism over exam results the system has come in for some criticism due to the lowering of grades for some individuals due to standardised weighting being applied causing distress to some i 'm very very keen that exams should go ahead as normal the pm said during a visit to a school in east london exams are a vital part of our education and i thank all the teachers for all the preparations they are making "clearly because of what has happened this year there is some anxiety about what grades pupils are going to get and everybody understands the system that the teachers are setting the grades then there 's a standardisation system how will schools return safely in september what does it mean for gcse and a level students that exams have been cancelled we will do our best to ensure that the hard work of pupils is properly reflected meanwhile pupils who had their recent exam results downgraded by the scottish qualifications authority will not all be expected to appeal nicola sturgeon has announced speaking at the scottish governments coronavirus briefing the first minister apologised for how exam results were dealt with she said i do acknowledge that we did not get this right and i am sorry for that speaking about problems with the sqa grading system ms sturgeon said too much focus had been given to the system rather than individuals we will be taking steps to ensure that every young person gets a grade that recognises the work they have done ms sturgeon said our concern which was to make sure that the grades young people got were as valid as those they would have got in any other year perhaps led us to think too much about the overall system and not enough about the individual pupil nicola sturgeon we accept we did n't get this right ms sturgeon added that burden has not fallen equally across our society despite our best intentions i acknowledge we did not get this right and i m sorry south of the border mr johnson said he hoped schools would not be forced to close as a result of local action i very much hope that does nt happen for any pupils but clearly what we are doing the way we are trying to manage the covid pandemic is to have local measures in place and local test and trace to introduce restrictions where that s necessary but as we have all said the last thing we want to do is to close schools we think that education is the priority for the country and that is simple social justice the prime minister claimed on sunday that there was a moral duty to get children back to school its not right that kids should spend more time out of school its much much better for their health and mental wellbeing obviously their educational prospects if everybody comes back to school full time in september its our moral duty as a country to make sure that happens the prime minister struck a conciliatory tone to education unions praising the work they had done to make classrooms safe itv news spoke to the students impacted its very important that everybody works together to ensure that our schools are safe and they are they are covid secure i have been very impressed by the work that the teachers have done working with the unions to make sure that all schools are safe to go back to in september a lot of work being done over making sure that there s social distancing bubbling staggered start times all that kind of thing but basically the plan is there get everybody

country the 75-year old first took office in 1994 and has been described as europes last dictator due to his authoritative state of rule prior to his first election lukashenko had built a reputation for himself as the fiery chairman of the parliamentary anti - corruption committee in 1996 two years after being elected lukashenko held a referendum which resulted in him earning greater powers as the country 's leader belarus ' leader wins sixth term as police and protesters clash many of those who have attempted to oppose his leadership have disappeared or been imprisoned for their views lukashenkos second election victory in 2001 was deemed undemocratic by western observers and he has since ended the two term rule following a further referendum in 2004 allowing to stay in his position in recent times the president has attracted plenty of interest due to his handling of the coronavirus lukashenko insisted that drinking vodka and sitting in a sauna would ward off the virus and sport continued in the country with crowds in attendance he even played in an ice hockey match to insist on the continuation of normality belarus ' leader wins sixth term as police and protesters clash the election took place with a backdrop of coronavirus and economic failings leading to the emergence of a surprising late challenger which has seen the campaign and result receive traction worldwide sviatlana tsikhanouskaya the wife of a jailed opposition blogger managed to unite opposition groups and draw tens of thousands to her campaign rallies tapping growing anger over a stagnant economy and fatigue with lukashenkos autocratic rule tsikhanouskaya earned popular support attracting a crowd of 63,000 to a rally in minsk but this was not reflected in the ballot box leading to calls that corruption was at play during the counting i will believe my own eyes the majority was for us tsikhanouskaya said lukashenko claimed during the campaign that russia had sent mercenaries to destabilise belarus and internet connectivity in the country has been severely disrupted since sunday in response to the results thousands took to the streets of belarus to protest against the leadership of lukashenko the manifestations were faced with a tough response from riot police who reportedly fired rubber bullets and tear gas with more than 100 people detained lukashenkos relations with vladimir putin are suffering an impasse and the west does not look favourably on his draconian leadership meaning his next months will be put under the microscope regardless of the official

improvements to testing before pupils return in september one school leaders union said the government should have a plan b in place for schools such as a week on week off rota system for pupils if there are further lockdowns and spikes in covid-19 cases but speaking to reporters at a school in east london mr johnson said he hoped schools would not be forced to close as a result of local action adding it is the last thing that the government wants to do it 's not right that kids should spend more time out of school it 's much much better for their health and mental well being their educational prospects if everybody comes back to school full time in september the prime minister said it 's out moral duty as a country to make sure that happens he added that a lot of work behind

right thing for everybody in this country a level results boris johnson pledges to ensure hard work of pupils is properly reflected it 's the right thing for pupils imagine we all remember in school there is a moment where something really clicks for you you really understand something for the first time imagine if that was n't happening for our kids this september imagine if they missed more of their education the prime minister struck a conciliatory tone to education unions who have raised concerns about the test and tracing system praising the work that school staff had already done to make classrooms safe he said its very important that everybody works together to ensure that our schools are safe and they are they are covid secure i have been very impressed by the work that the teachers have done working with the unions to make sure that all schools are safe to go back to in september but basically the plan is there get everybody back in september that s the right thing for everybody in this country geoff barton general secretary of the association of school and college leaders ascl said heads supported the full reopening of schools in september and the pledge to make it a national priority but he added we are concerned about the lack of a national plan b if there is a second wave of coronavirus and there is a second national shutdown the government guidance requires schools to have in place their own contingency plans which are based on a return to remote education in the event of local closures earlier education secretary gavin williamsoninsisted it was safe for schools to return as there is little evidence ofcoronavirusbeing transmitted in schools mr williamson said the government was being guided by the best scientific and medical advice as it boosts plans to reopen schools to all pupils in england next month he said the education and care of our children is a national priority ahead of the full return of all pupils to school in september we are continuing to do everything in our power to ensure all children can be back in their classrooms safely as this is the best place for them to be for their education development and wellbeing during his

time since june video report by itv news political correspondent carl dinnen boris johnson has spoken of a moral duty to get all children back in class amid indications he would force pubs restaurants and shops to close ahead of schools in the event of severe coronavirus flare ups the prime minister is understood to favour only closing schools as the last resort after scientific advisers warned more restrictions may be needed to reopen classrooms in england next month childrens commissioner for england anne longfield had said the reopening of schools should be prioritised insisting they must be first to reopen and last to close during any reintroduction of restrictions political correspondent carl dinnen says the pm 's plans to get pupils back in to schools have been welcomed by parents but teaching unions still have some concerns but schools minister nick gibb said this week that the government can not decree that classroom education would be prioritised instead saying decisions would be made by local health chiefs however a no 10 source said on saturday mr johnsons expectation is that schools would be the last sector to close with firms being shut first in the event of severe local lockdowns the pm has been clear that businesses including shops pubs and restaurants should be forced to close first with schools remaining open for as long as possible the source said experts warn pubs may have to close to allow schools to reopen safely as coronavirus infections grow coronavirus test and trace needs scaling up for schools to reopen safely and to avoid a second wave study finds mr johnson writing in the mail on sunday said it is the national priority to get all pupils back into classrooms in september after months without in person education this pandemic is nt over and the last thing any of us can afford to do is become complacent he wrote but now that we know enough to reopen schools to all pupils safely we have a moral duty to do so he warned of the spiralling economic costs of parents and carers being unable to work adding keeping our schools closed a moment longer than absolutely necessary is socially intolerable economically unsustainable and morally indefensible the prime minister was also keen to stress the potential damage to childrens health if they do not return and that the virus presents only a very low threat of making them seriously ill amid concerns parents may not feel comfortable sending them back during the pandemic the downing street source said the pm has stressed that the harm done to childrens education prospects by not attending school as well as to their mental health is far more damaging than the low risk posed which schools will be carefully managing and that those from disadvantaged backgrounds are suffering the most professor chris whitty the chief medical officer for england has warned the nation has probably reached near the limit or the limits of what can be done to reopen society safely and professor neil ferguson whose modelling led to the decision to impose the lockdown suggested ministers would need to row back on the relaxation of restrictions to allow a full time return to schools while keeping the virus under control on wednesday mr gibb said a more nuanced response would be taken when asked about ms longfields call for schools to be prioritised as she criticised ministers for treating children as an afterthought during the crisis he told the bbc all children would be returning next month including in areas hit by local lockdowns which currently includes preston greater manchester leicester and parts of east lancashire and west yorkshire but you ca nt decree this for every single case and it will depend on the circumstances of a local increase in the infection rate and that is why it is being led by the director of public health in localities but we want all children back in school he added coronavirus new quarantine restrictions and face covering rules implemented schools must come before pubs and shops in coronavirus lockdown planning labour mp dawn butler has accused the metropolitan police of racial profiling after she and a friend were stopped by officers while driving in london ms butler the labour mp for brent central was pulled over by officers in hackney east london on sunday afternoon while she and a black male friend were driving through the borough in a nice car the former shadow equalities secretary told channel 4 news there was no other reason she was stopped apart from the colour of our skin and it 's a fairly nice car ms butler recorded the interesting incident which showed her telling the officers it was really quite irritating to be pulled over she told the officers she felt she can not drive around and enjoy a sunday afternoon whilst black because you re going to be stopped by police one of the officers told her that is n't the case at all said he appreciated everything she had said and apologised to her for wasting her time she said the way the officers stopped her was polite but said she was concerned about the reason for the stop bbc apologises for use of racist term in news report if you 're just profiling people who are driving outside the area i think that 's a ridiculous reason to stop if you 're profiling people who are driving a certain type of car that 's an inappropriate reason to stop and if you 're profiling people because of the colour of their skin that 's an inappropriate reason to stop she told the officers at the start of the video one officer asks if ms butler is from london adding we 're just asking what you 're up to in the area that 's all we 're doing proactive patrols in the hackney borough combatting gang and knife crime things like that we also want to know that people are driving legitimately as well he added ms butler told the officers she is a member of parliament who has been working with the police around stop and search the way you do it and the way you profile is wrong she told the officers because what you do is you create an environment where you create animosity ms butler told c4 her upset and outrage is that this happens every single day to innocent black people she said she wants to make the system fairer so that people can just walk about or go about on a sunny sunday afternoon and go to lunch without fear of being stopped and searched because of the colour of their skin one officer explained the reason for the stop saying the police 's number plate recognition system had made an error protesters march for nhs worker injured in racially aggravated hit and run itv poll finds 77 % of black people think police has a culture of racism itv poll finds 77 per cent of black people have been racially abused when asked for a further explanation the officer said i typed in the registration it 's come up the same make model colour of the vehicle and it said something about north yorkshire run it through again that north yorkshire 's not there anymore when asked how that could have happened the officer said i do n't know i do apologise ms butler said met police commissioner cressida dick should spend all of her waking moments trying to eradicate institutional racism from the met police ms dick has previously said the term institutional racism is not a label i findhelpful responding to that in her interview with c4 ms butler said if she does n't find it a helpful term then she 's not the right person for the job the met police explained the incident saying prior to the stop an officer incorrectly entered the registration into a police computer which identified the car as registered to an address in yorkshire upon stopping the vehicle and speaking with the driver it quickly became apparent that the registration had been entered incorrectly and was registered to the driver in london once the mistake was realised the officer sought to explain this to the occupants they were then allowed on their way no searches were carried out on any individuals met police north west chief superintendent roy smith tweeted after speaking to ms butler on the phone and said the force is listening to her concerns bbc receives 18,600 complaints over news report containing racist term he wrote she was positive about one officer & gave feedback on others & the stop we are listening to those concerns & dawn is quite entitled to raise them the met police added we would welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter further with the occupants if they wish to do so video report by itv news

criticised the government led service for being too slow a contact tracer working as part of blackburns own system told itv news that they were having much more success than national tracers as people

included in northern coronavirus lockdown restrictions coronavirus r number could be above one in london south west and north west speaking at a press conference this afternoon he told itv news the

test & trace we are planning to do what other areas with high levels of infection are doing for example in blackburn and darwen before we reach that level of infection we will be on our way to establishing our own local contact tracing programme we really need to work together with the national agencies and that s what were doing lockdown restrictions have already been put in place in

police in may that they had seen boris johnsons chief adviser while walking in houghall woods near durham on april 19 the weekend after he had returned to work in london mr cummings has denied making this second trip insisting photos and data on his phone disprove the allegations durham constabulary ultimately said they would not take retrospective action despite finding that the prime ministers

minor breach of lockdown rules public trust in government fell after dominic cummings durham trip report finds this included a visit to barnard castle on easter sunday which he said he used to assess his fitness to drive back to london the next day following his recovery from illness however mr and mrs edwards have since put in a subject access request in order to determine exactly how their complaint was followed up a spokeswoman for the independent office for police conduct iopc told the pa news agency in accordance with the police complaints procedure we have forwarded a complaint to

of may 28 durham constabulary carried out an investigation into this matter led by a senior detective and found insufficient evidence to support the allegation the new allegation follows publication of research which said mr cummings trip to durham while suffering from coronavirus drastically undermined public trust in the governments handling of the pandemic the analysis published in the lancet and carried out by university college london ucl found that his actions reduced peoples willingness to follow social distancing rules dominic cummings trip to durham at the height of lockdown while suffering from coronavirus drastically undermined public trust in the governments handling of the pandemic according to new research the analysis conducted by university college london ucl found the actions of the prime ministers chief adviser reduced peoples willingness to follow social distancing rules published in the lancet the research analysed 220,000 survey results from 40,000 participants

cummings had not followed spirit of lockdown guidance among participants living in england confidence dropped approximately 0.4 points on this scale between may 21 and 25 news of mr cummings 420 km drive with his wife and child broke on may 22 the researchers assessed the impact of his actions by comparing the levels of confidence those living in scotland and wales said they had in their devolved governments there was no comparable drop in confidence in the leaders of scotland and wales over this time period the researchers found those living in england had not regained their confidence in the uk government with the gap between those in england and the devolved nations continuing to widen it revealed that adherence to lockdown which was already starting to decline dropped more rapidly in the following weeks particularly in england lead author dr daisy fancourt of ucl institute of epidemiology and health care said public trust in the governments ability to manage the pandemic is crucial as it underpins public attitudes and behaviours at a precarious time for public health she added trust in government decisions and actions relating to the management of covid-19 is a major challenge globally and these data illustrate the negative and lasting consequences that political decisions can have for public trust and the risks to behaviours the social study was launched in the week before the uk went into lockdown it tracks how adults are feeling about the lockdown government advice and overall wellbeing and mental health shadow health secretary jonathan ashworth said boris johnsons failure to confront dominic cummings over his lockdown breach was a monumental misjudgement the government rightly asked the british people to make huge sacrifices to drive down infection rates so to have allowed his most senior adviser to blatantly break the rules undermined vital life saving public health messaging at the peak of this deadly pandemic meanwhile the daily

england could face a summer of violent social unrest without immediate intervention in june the west midlands recorded more incidents of violent crime than at any point in the past 14 months and the regions police and crime commissioner has told itv news he fears a repeat of the riots of 2011 david jamieson spoke of a recipe for disaster which is made up of hundreds of thousands if not millions of young people out of work and older children not in school we could see considerable social unrest he said you 've just got to think of 2011 when those riots just sprang from nowhere he added how his police force has n't got the resource to deal with large scale disruption beyond what it 's already contending with after a considerable drop in violent crime during lockdown rates are rising again with data from the metropolitan police showing the number of incidents fast approaching pre - covid levels the childrens commissioner for england has told itv news she is increasingly worried about the number of children falling victim to violent crime teenagers are one of these really high risk groups these are children who may have been experiencing all sorts of activities when at home said anne longield there may have been more domestic violence more addiction maybe more poor mental health within the home and those children now they re more mobile as well as being left without that supervision and guidance and may find themselves become targets to grooming that 's something i 'm incredibly worried about these are children who have been out of school for 6 months often those are the kids who were n't really enamoured with school in the first place lots of absenteeism i m really worried that those may fall through the gaps over the coming weeks and become victims of serious violence i want councils and schools and others to really identify who those children are when they re at risk and then work with them and their parents to make sure they do re engage with school and get back into that classroom in september the city of stoke on trent has seen a spike in muggings and stabbings in recent weeks 13 year old joe not his real name was stabbed in the city last week

side and a centimetre deeper the boy 's mum told itv news she feels on edge constantly and angry does someone have to die for it to be taken seriously she asked i could be arranging for family members to come and stay so they can attend a funeral for my 13-year old child and it 's wrong a group of mothers in stoke are so worried they ve formed their own support group each of them has at least one child who has been the victim of knife crime or a violent attack in recent weeks they have written to the prime minister urging him to address rising levels of violence with the same urgency as the government is tackling coronavirus the home office said supporting vulnerable children and young people through the coronavirus crisis is crucial which is why we ve provided an additional 6.5 million to prevent them being drawn into crime and violence the government has also established violence reduction units in the 18 areas most affected by serious violence to ensure a more joined up local approach to tackling this complex issue as part of this we have allocated more than 19 million to the west midlands this is addition to the most substantial increase in police funding in a decade with

political correspondent paul brand she was devastated to learn the former minister had not been suspended by the party following his arrest the man is his 50s was arrested by the metropolitan police last saturday and has since been bailed pending investigation asked during a visit to warrington if he was confident it was the right decision not to remove the whip from the former minister amid safeguarding concerns mr johnson reporters i think its very very important that we take all these cases extremely seriously and we will continue to do so i think we ve got to wait for the police to decide whether they want to make charges and take a decision on that basis alleged rape victim of tory mp devastated party wo n't suspend him tory mp arrested on suspicion of rape will not be suspended from party while investigation ongoing tory chief whip refuses to confirm if he knew of rape allegations against mp four months ago after learning the mp would remain in the party the victim told itv news she felt like senior ministers care more about protecting the mp and the party than protecting victims and other women the woman an ex - parliamentary worker claims she told tory chief whip mark spencer about the mp 's behaviour four months ago but a source for the senior conservative said he was not made aware of the magnitude of allegations its taken me a long time to build up the courage and strength to finally go to the police it was a relief yesterday to see he was arrested so quickly she said she told of her relief at hearing the mp had been arrested but said she was devastated to learn that they wo nt suspend the whip i feel like the chief whip has never taken my allegations seriously or even cared she added since the news of the arrest the chief whip or anyone from the party have not contacted me at all not to discuss the caseworker offer support or anything the alleged victim said adding that they have her number and email address she said she had put in requests to speak to the chief whip and leader of the house of commons jacob rees mogg but has not heard anything back chief whip mark spencer did not directly respond when asked if reports were true that he had been made aware of the allegations as early as april but said he was taking the reports very seriously the allegations relate to four separate incidents claimed to have taken place between july 2019 and january 2020 the sunday times which reported the woman and the mp were in a relationship last year says the mp assaulted her forced her to have sex and left her so traumatised that she had to go to hospital chief whip spencer explained why the mp had not been suspended from the party saying it 's down to the police to do that thorough investigation not for the whip 's office to investigate this alleged crime the decision not to remove the whip means the mp will be allowed to continue representing the conservatives in the house of commons the tory mp 's name has not been revealed in order to protect the identity of the victim mr spencer said people must bear in mind the victim we do nt want to do anything to identify the victim at the same time housing secretary robert jenrick has denied sweeping reforms to the planning system are designed to help the big boys after labour said the move would help developers avoid contributing to local projects the government says its major overhaul of planning policy in england is designed to protect green spaces while making it easier to build on brownfield sites but labour branded the move a developer 's charter that will see communities sidelined in decisions and denied vital funding for building schools clinics and community infrastructure the royal institute of british architects riba said there was every chance the proposals could also lead to the creation of the next generation of slum housing under the proposals developers will stop paying contributions to the local council for social housing and will instead pay a national infrastructure levy which the housing secretary says will raise more money than the current levy economic downturn less severe than feared bank of england says mr jenrick said that cash will all flow to the local council who will be able to spend it on affordable housing social housing as well as all the other things that people care about like schools gp surgeries parks and playgrounds itv news political correspondent libby wiener asked mr jenrick why he wanted to replace the current community levy which he allegedly allowed a housing developer to avoid paying into earlier this year mr jenrick approved an application by tory donor richard desmond to build 1,500 flats in east london one day before the current levy came into force effectively saving the developer millions the decision was later reversed after legal action by tower hamlets council and mr jenrick admitted what he did was unlawful by reason of apparent bias speaking to itv news mr jenrick insisted the new proposals will mean that developers pay their fair share they wo n't be able to wriggle out of their commitments and there wo n't be a lengthy debate about how much they need to pay at the suggestion that he tried to help someone do exactly that wriggle out of their commitments mr jenrick said absolutely not that 's completely wrong he added these proposals do not help the big boys in this market far from it they help people get on the housing ladder for the first time they enable more homes to be built in more parts of the country and more infrastructure to build public support for that housing pm has full confidence in jenrick over cash for favours ' row as starmer calls for investigation prime minister boris johnson and his senior aide dominic cummings have both advocated reform to the system and the proposals in the planning for the future white paper published on thursday set out the governments vision mr johnson has defended the proposals insisting they will result in more social housing being built during a visit to a housing development in warrington he told reporters what were doing is simplifying the process so you actually get much more affordable housing this solution gives them builders a much simpler infrastructure levy that enables them to go ahead and build a much bigger chunk of affordable housing and help people onto the property ladder part of the new process will involve quicker development on land which has been designated for renewal with a permission in principle approach that the ministry of housing communities and local government mhclg said will balance the need for proper checks with a speedier way of working the other two categories will see land designated for growth where new homes hospitals and schools will be allowed automatically to empower development while areas of outstanding natural beauty and the green belt will come under the protection category mr jenrick said it takes seven years to agree local housing plans and five years just to get a spade in the ground and the proposed changes aim to speed up the process he added these once in a generation reforms will lay the foundations for a brighter future providing more homes for young people and creating better quality neighbourhoods and homes across the country we will cut red tape but not standards placing a higher regard on quality design and the environment than ever before it also aims to boost the share of houses built by small and medium sized building firms which built 40 % of new homes 30 years ago but only 12 % today the white paper proposes that all new streets should be tree lined and the mhclg also says all new homes to be carbon neutral by 2050 with no new homes delivered under the new system needed to be retrofitted councils will also be forced to lay out a local plan of where new homes can be built as only 50 % have such schemes in place the reforms aim to reduce the number of planning cases that get overturned at appeal by creating a clearer rules based system a new national levy would replace the current system of developer contributions and beautiful buildings will be fast tracked through the planning system but riba president alan jones said while there s no doubt the planning system needs reform these shameful proposals do almost nothing to guarantee the delivery of affordable well designed and sustainable homes while they might help to get britain building paired with the extension of permitted development there s every chance they could also lead to the creation of the next generation of slum housing shadow housing minister mike amesbury said this is a developers charter that will see communities sidelined in decisions and denied vital funding for building schools clinics and community infrastructure tom fyans deputy chief executive of cpre campaign to protect rural england said the key acid test for the planning reforms is community involvement and on first reading its still not clear how this will work under a zoning system the local government associations chairman james jamieson said nine in 10 applications are approved by councils with more than a million homes given planning permission over the last decade yet to be built and the system should focus on that any loss of local control over developments would be a concern the tory council chief warned kate henderson chief executive of the national housing federation said the government was proposing to scrap section 106 agreements which can be used to require private developers to build a certain amount of social homes on a site any alternative to section 106 must ensure we can deliver more high quality affordable homes to meet the huge demand across the country she said but matthew fell cbi chief uk policy director said the reforms will allow housebuilders to get to work and the royal institution of chartered surveyors welcomed the moves as a big step in the right direction eugene marchese of retirement community developer guild living said the government 's plans do not go far enough in addressing britain 's shortage of purpose built housing for older people he said in the rush to build we must not forget the needs of people in later life who face a worsening shortage of high quality later living accommodation that can support their health and wellbeing and provide them with tailored care should they need it as the government consults on how local areas assess and plan to meet their housing needs it is imperative that the needs of older people are not forgotten with the right implementation these reforms create a fantastic opportunity to repurpose town centre sites to create a new generation of retirement homes that restore people in later life to their rightful place at the heart of our communities there were also concerns about the environmental measures contained within the proposals nikki williams director of campaigning and policy at the wildlife trusts said tree lined streets are not enough she added parks green spaces and all the areas around our homes must be part of a wild network of nature rich areas that will benefit bees and birds as much as it will enable people to connect with on your doorstep nature every single day john alker director of policy and places at the uk green building council said they were deeply concerned by the 2050 target for carbon neutral homes all new homes must rather be net zero carbon in operation by 2030 at the latest in order to meet our national net zero target he said fred dimbleby will be analysing the 2020 us election digital campaigns for our brand new podcast will trump win here he explains why donald trump is weaker online than four years ago but still holds a key advantage over joe biden unless kanye west has a surprise surge whoever triumphs out of donald trump and joe biden will enter office as the united states ' oldest president in history and yet these two septuagenarians will be relying on one of the most digitally active campaigns to win this election thanks to the pandemic convention centres filled with flag waving supporters look to be out in 2020 and into the vacuum with all its noise and contested claims will be digital campaigning so what 's different this time round in 2016 a weak digital campaign damaged hillary clinton 's electoral hopes and a well organised online campaign helped trump reach the 270 electoral college votes needed to access the white house but four years is a virtual eternity online and a lot has changed at the last election tech platforms still had a veneer of being disruptive innovative and of existing outside of the establishment will trump win listen to the first episode and subscribe wherever you get your podcasts including apple podcasts and spotify rightly or wrongly they were viewed more as start ups where employees played ping pong in their lunch break rather than institutions capable of changing the course of electoral history but 2016 quickly changed that view allegations of foreign interference disinformation online and suspicion about mass data gathering operations led to a fall in their popularity the recent antitrust hearings where the heads of the major tech firms were virtually hauled before congress emphasised that the companies had become part of the establishment attacked by politicians for being too big and all encompassing the coronavirus pandemic has cemented this increased scrutiny of social media and big tech when truth and fact became a matter of life and death it is unsurprising that any platform hosting disinformation is criticised all of this impacts the biden and trump campaigns forced to be accountable social media platforms more actively crack down on false or suspicious information than in 2016 tiktok and twitter have banned political ads and facebook has set up avoting information centrefor this election broadcasting public service information to their users both twitter and facebookhave added caveatsto misleading posts from president donald trump 's accounts and twitter even temporarily restricted the ability of his son donald trump jr. to post on the platform in other words some regulation has been added to the online free market that existed in 2016 but misinformation is still all too present online a pro - trump conspiracy group qanon has facebook pages with huge followings anti - vaccine misinformation exists on most major platforms and prominent users continue to post fake information with little scrutiny offensive posts are still present in all parts of the online space and many have called on platforms to improve rapidly campaigning online may be more regulated but many of the problems of 2016 remain how do donald trump and joe biden 's digital presences compare donald trump starts this campaign ahead again building from his successful disruptive blueprint in the last election online campaigning is not just about advertising but organic content a message delivered straight to a voter from a candidate 's account may be more effective than an advert in terms of the people he can reach organically trump has a huge head start he has 26 million more likes on his official facebook page than biden and his opponents 7.7 million twitter followers looks measly in comparison to trump 's 84 million this imbalance means that when trump posts on social media more people naturally view it the trump campaign have solidified this advantage with their financing on advertising since the start of july they have consistently spent more than biden on facebook ads and in the most recent week of data trump spent $ 2 million 1.5 million more than his opponent biden ads admit to this disparity by using trumps fundraising success to motivate donors to give money to the campaign but it 's not all easy sailing for the trump campaign tiktok the video sharing app that is a new player in the online political scene in 2020 has already caught the campaign out its young user base reportedly helpeddisrupt trump 's rally in tulsa floridaearlier this year trump 's former campaign manager brad parscale who once seemed to be fully in control of all things digital was moved into a different role after the failed rally to repeat success online twice is a tough ask with many of the trick cards already played in 2016 the trump campaign may struggle to innovate this year and to build a digital strategy suited to the political climate of the election so what should we look out for in the coming months this all comes down to two digital campaigns that have never been more important and more scrutinised forced online by a global pandemic the pressure is on for both candidates to maximise this opportunity this online election pitches a previously successful campaign adapting to the new rules online against an underdog rapidly trying to catch up a good digital campaign helped trump win in

coronavirus cases scotland 's first minister has announced nicola sturgeon speaking at the coronavirus briefing in edinburgh said a cluster of 54 coronavirus cases had been identified in aberdeen with more than 20 other pubs and restaurants thought to be involved as such ms sturgeon said all indoor and outdoor hospitality must close by 5 pm on wednesday the cluster has led to a greater fear among health experts that aberdeen was experiencing a significant outbreak of coronavirus some 191 contacts have been traced in relation to the cluster but ms sturgeon added the number was expected to rise throughout the day scotland records highest daily increase in coronavirus cases for several weeks the first minister said the restrictions which will be enforced in the aberdeen city council area were reimposed extremely reluctantly among the restrictions is a five mile travel rule and residents are being told not to enter each others houses the new rules will be backed by governmental regulations the first minister said and will be enforced if they are not followed she acknowledged she was sharing deeply deeply unwelcome news but provided some hope of a swift change in policy if cases fall she said the changes will be reviewed next wednesday when she hoped they could be removed entirely or in part however if necessary ms sturgeon said they could be extended beyond the seven day period

sturgeon confirms there have been no coronavirus deaths in scotland for the 20th day in a row ms sturgeon told the media briefing and restrictions have been imposed in an attempt to carry on the positive trend our precautionary and careful judgement is that we need to take decisive action now difficult as that undoubtedly is in order to try to contain this outbreak and prevent further harm later on she said she added acting now we judge gives us the time and the space to protect the ability of our young people to return to education the first minister said hotel restaurants will be allowed to remain open under the new rules but to provide food for residents only she added that takeaway restaurants can continue the mayor of luton has resigned after being caught breaking lockdown rules to attend a party just days after warnings about spikes of coronavirus in his town video footage showed labour cllr tahir malik at a packed garden party with at least twelve other people in july despite government rules allowing no more than six people or two households to meet at any one time mr malik apologised for attending this gathering which was in breach of covid-19 lockdown restrictions and said he regretted his actions an investigation into mr malik 's behaviour was carried out by luton borough council after the daily telegraph released a video from the party showing the mayor ignoring social distancing rules the video surfaced shortly after public health england warned about a spike of coronavirus cases in the town designating it an area of intervention coronavirus lockdown restrictions reimposed in aberdeen following spike bereaved families of covid-19 victims accuse boris johnson of ignoring them schools must come before pubs and shops in coronavirus lockdown planning in the video mr malik can be seen with other labour councillors laughing and eating in a statement mr malik said once again i regret my actions which were below the standard of my position and would like to sincerely apologise to the people of luton for attending this gathering which was in breach of covid-19 lockdown restrictions there is no excuse for what i did i should have known better and i accept full responsibility for my actions the labour mayor who was appointed to his role in may last year said he was planning to wait for the investigation to conclude but decided the best thing i could do for the town was resign from my position with immediate effect he added i have learnt a valuable lesson from this but i hope the consequence of my actions serves as a reminder to the people of luton of the importance of following the covid-19 guidelines as it remains a real and serious threat the three councillors who attended the party released a statement at the time saying they thought it was going to be a small socially distanced gathering in line with the government guidelines the council said it received a number of complaints about the three councillors who admitted to attending the function cllr hazel simmons leader of luton council thanked mr malik for his 15 months service he made a mistake which he deeply regrets and i know he and his family are really hurting right now she said what has happened is unfortunate and i think it is right for him to step down at this time but its important to recognise the fantastic contribution he has made to luton he will be replaced by a new mayor following a council meeting on september 29 douglas ross has been named the new leader of the scottish conservatives the moray mp was the only person to put themselves forward to replace jackson carlaw who resigned from the role last week he will step down as an mp and seek election as an msp at the next holyrood elections in may. former scottish conservative leader and edinburgh central msp ruth davidson has agreed to lead first ministers questions in the interim mr ross tweeted becoming leader of the scottish conservatives today is the honour and privilege of a lifetime now our focus must turn to earning the trust of people looking for a positive and credible alternative for scotland and who want a fresh start for our country i hope you ll join us boris johnson congratulated the former scotland office minister who resigned from government over dominic cummings ' infamous trip to durham on twitter the prime minister wrote i ve just spoken to @douglas4moray and congratulated him on becoming leader of the @scottories i look forward to working with douglas to promote scotlands place in our united kingdom previous leader mr carlaw stepped down last thursday after less than six months in the post the snp criticised mr ross 's appointment as leader saying boris johnson has installed a brexit backing mp to act as a puppet for downing street snp deputy leader keith brown msp added whatever else we ve learned in this whole grubby coup and whatever their bluster senior tories are now effectively conceding publicly what they have been saying privately for some time they know there is going to be an independence referendum otherwise why bother changing leaders video report by itv news health editor emily morgan easing lockdown is a tricky business doing it too fast too soon or all at once will allow coronavirus to surge back lifting it slowly or prolonging it will have huge social and economic consequences so the task for ministers and government scientific advisors has been to take measured calculated risks and ease it slowly two weeks at a time and monitor the effects none of this would be possible though without a robust test trace and isolate system in place why because testing people tracing their contacts and telling them to isolate is at the moment the only way to stop the spread of the virus there is no vaccine yet and as the world health organisation warned yesterday there may never be we need to be prepared to live with this for the foreseeable future news then that scientists are warning current testing and tracing is not good enough to prevent a second wave is worrying in modelling looking at a range of scenarios scientists suggest when schools open and parents start to go back to work and communities open up we could be looking at a second wave in december twice as bad as the first unless testing and tracing improves test and trace needs scaling up for schools to reopen safely and to avoid a second wave study finds the researchers say only 50 % of contacts of covid cases are being reached even if that rises to 68 % with schools fully opening another outbreak is highly likely this just underlines the importance of a fully functioning test and trace system only yesterday the government was trumpeting two new testing kits that can turn around results in 90 minutes nearly half a million of them will be rolled out next week to care homes and labs supposedly helping to reach the target of 500,000 tests being done a day but even that is not guaranteed some scientists are warning the tests themselves are unchecked little known about and might not be accurate itv news health editor emily morgan explains that the rise in the number of tests may explain why the number of cases is not going down the government they say is backing technology that comes with risks and we wo nt know whether it ll be effective for many weeks the question is this is our test and trace system good enough to allow schools to reopen fully get parents back to work as well as continue opening up other facilities the scientists today say no admittedly the modelling is based on many different assumptions but we have little else to go on the government insists our tracking system is one of the best in the world and improving all the time new game changing coronavirus tests can diagnose covid-19 and flu in 90 minutes pubs may have to close for schools to reopen as virus cases rise it may be improving all the time but will it improve enough in just over a month to ensure schools can open and a second wave is avoided this is where drastic decisions will need to be taken will schools open at the expense of pubs and or restaurants the last five months have taught us that a lot can happen in five weeks and i m just pleased its not me who will have to make that call at the end of august today the local authority with the highest infection rate in england has also launched its own contact tracing system staff from blackburn with darwen borough council set up its own virus hunting team after the national test and trace system failed to reach hundreds of vulnerable residents under the new scheme the council which is being supported by public health england said staff will track down people who were n't reached by the national system after 48 hours if local officials ca n't make contact after two days council workers will do a home visit to give advice and offer support figures released on monday showed the rate of new cases in blackburn with darwen fell slightly from 81.9 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to july 24 to 77.9 in the seven days to july 31 a total of 116 new cases were recorded video report by itv news political correspondent carl dinnen a woman accusing a tory mp of raping her has said she was devastated to learn how the former minister was not suspended by the party following his arrest the alleged victim told itv news political correspondent paul brand that senior ministers seem to care more about protecting the mp and the party than protecting victims and other women on saturday a man in his 50s was arrested on suspicion of rape and has since been bailed the metropolitan police confirmed the woman an ex - parliamentary worker claims she told tory chief whip mark spencer about the mp 's behaviour four months ago but a source for the senior conservative said he was not made aware of the magnitude of allegations tory mp arrested on suspicion of rape will not be suspended from party while investigation ongoing tory chief whip refuses to confirm if he knew of rape allegations against mp four months ago its taken me a long time to build up the courage and strength to finally go to the police it was a relief yesterday to see he was arrested so quickly she said she told of her relief at hearing the mp had been arrested but said she was devastated to learn that they wo nt suspend the whip i feel like the chief whip has never taken my allegations seriously or even cared she added since the news of the arrest the chief whip or anyone from the party have not contacted me at all not to discuss the caseworker offer support or anything the alleged victim said adding how they have her number and email address she said she 'd put in requests to speak to the chief whip and leader of the house of commons jacob rees mogg but has not heard anything back chief whip mark spencer did not directly respond when asked if reports were true that he had been made aware of the allegations as early as april but said he was taking the reports very seriously i 've nothing to add at this stage i mean there is an ongoing police investigation i think we need to wait for the police to do their work he told a reporter they 'll come forward with their findings and at that stage i think we can start and address the issues in hand the allegations relate to four separate incidents claimed to have taken place between july 2019 and january 2020 the sunday times which reported the woman and the mp were in a relationship last year says the mp assaulted her forced her to have sex and left her so traumatised that she had to go to hospital chief whip spencer explained why the mp had not been suspended from the party saying it 's down to the police to do that thorough investigation not for the whip 's office to investigate this alleged crime the decision not to remove the whip means the mp will be allowed to continue representing the conservatives in the house of commons health secretary matt hancock also declined to comment on the allegations or the party 's decision not to suspend the mp this is a very sensitive matter it 's under police investigation and hence i ca n't make any comment he said the tory mp 's name has not been revealed in order to protect the identity of the victim mr spencer said people must bear in mind the victim we do nt want to do anything to identify the victim at the same time labour 's shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding jess phillips says it is shocking the mp has n't been suspended and has been calling for the man to be named there is no law in this country that provides anonymity to those who are accused that is just a simple fact and the conservative party trying to pretend that they are doing this out of the best interest for the victim that they ignored it does n't hold water she told itv news she added i absolutely think that there is a safeguarding issue and an issue about there being one rule for the rest of the country and one rule for politics if you 're a constituent in this man 's constituency i think that maybe you have a right to choose whether you want to safeguard yourself because the conservative party have chosen not to safeguard by suspending the tory whip very vulnerable people go and see members of parliament and the country has a right just like they do with teachers just like they do with police officers just like they do in hospitals they have a right to be kept safeguarding when allegations like this are made pharmaceutical companies should stockpile six weeks worth of drugs to guard against disruption at the end of the brexit transition period the government has warned the department of health and social care dhsc has written to medicine suppliers advising them to make boosting their reserves a priority the letter published online on monday reiterates that ministers will not be asking for an extension to the transition period past december 31 despite the coronavirus pandemic there are concerns that the covid-19 crisis has led to a dwindling of some medical stocks and that a disorderly exit without a trade deal could cause significant disruption suppliers were advised all scenarios must be planned for including reduced traffic flow at short crossings such as between calais and dunkirk and dover and folkestone we recognise that global supply chains are under significant pressure exacerbated by recent events with covid-19 the letter says however we encourage companies to make stockpiling a key part of contingency plans and ask industry where possible to stockpile to a target level of six weeks total stock on uk soil the advice comes amid continued uncertainty over whether the uk and the eu will be able to strike an agreement on a future relationship before time runs out brussels chief negotiator michel barnier said last month that londons position made the prospects of a deal at this point unlikely britain must live with the consequences of looser ties with eu says angela merkel majority of britons oppose weakening of food standards under uk us trade deal four years on from the eu referendum what s going on with brexit laws underpinning new lockdown restrictions for greater manchester parts of east lancashire and west yorkshire are yet to be implemented four days after they were introduced the government has admitted ministers said the restrictions placing bans on people from different households meeting following a spike in coronavirus cases were effective from midnight on friday when the changes were announced officials said new regulations were needed to make them legally enforceable government slammed for handling of new coronavirus restrictions in north west england guidance published on friday stated that it would be against the law for people from different households to meet in a private home or garden unless they are part of a support bubble and warned of 100 fines for those who flout the rules officials said the laws were due to be signed off and published later that night while downing street said on monday powers to curb travel in and out of hotspots may be introduced itv news correspondent damon green reports from manchester but on monday afternoon the department of health and social care confirmed it was yet to implement laws bringing the rules into force it said it was trying to make the changes legally enforceable as soon as possible but insisted the rules still applied from july 31 when asked by the pa news agency why there was a delay and on what legal basis the rules were currently being enforced the department refused to comment major incident declared in greater manchester as coronavirus infection rates rise shrouded in secrecy top scientist calls for more transparency on covid-19 decision making new ' game changing coronavirus tests can diagnose covid-19 and flu in 90 minute but on this occasion so far this has been unable to happen due to the delay in publishing the laws it is understood the new restrictions apply to greater manchester including the city of manchester trafford stockport oldham bury wigan bolton tameside rochdale and salford they also apply to blackburn with darwen burnley hyndburn pendle and rossendale in lancashire and bradford calderdale and kirklees in west yorkshire similar restrictions will also apply to leicester which saw the first so called local lockdown imposed on june 29 health secretary matt hancock announced the decision in a series of tweets on thursday after there had been an increasing rate of transmission in parts of northern england muslims celebrating eid in the affected areas were urged not to host or visit friends and family in each others homes or gardens and not to meet friends and family in other venues including restaurants or cafes anger over failure to communicate after rule change disrupts eid celebrations the government faced criticism for unveiling the new restrictions late at night and just hours before they came into force with some saying this prompted confusion in the communities affected while supportive of the measures greater manchester mayor andy burnham told the bbc on friday he had concerns about the way they were announced and said the lack of immediate detail was disorientating for the public meanwhile downing street said powers to ban movement in and out of coronavirus hotspots could be used to curb the spread of covid-19 officials confirmed the measures which could include shutting down transport networks would be considered if needed to prevent a spike in cases london mayor sadiq khan hit out at totally unacceptable reports that the capital could be effectively cut off from the rest of england if there was a surge in cases there but downing street insisted no specific plans for the uks biggest city had been drawn up however number 10 acknowledged that measures to effectively ban travel around

needed for the nhs was in place yet we showed at the francis crick at that time 45 % of frontline healthcare were infected and they were not being tested because capacity was inadequate now that is nt

suspicion of rape will not be suspended from party while investigation ongoing i 've nothing to add at this stage i mean there is an ongoing police investigation i think we need to wait for the police

traumatised that she had to go to hospital chief whip spencer explained why the mp had not been suspended from the party saying it 's down to the police to do that thorough investigation not for the whip 's office to investigate this alleged crime the decision not to remove the whip means the mp will be allowed to continue representing the conservatives in the house of commons mr spencer said the tory party was taking the allegations very seriously and would assess the mp 's position once the police investigation had concluded health secretary matt hancock also declined to comment on the allegations or the party 's decision not to suspend the mp this is a very sensitive matter it 's under police investigation and hence i ca n't make any comment he said the tory mp 's name has not been

from boris johnson 's coronavirus lockdown update he also said there was no plan as far as i m aware to bring in travel controls and restrictions on where londoners could stay as part of efforts to avoid any increased transmission rate in the capital from spreading to the rest of the country it has been suggested that should the r rate escalate in the capital the m25 would act as a travel border

government 's decision to lift shielding measures such as food and medicine deliveries for vulnerable people in manchester and other areas now under tougher lockdown restrictions the former labour mp branded the decision cruel and inhuman mayor of greater manchester andy burnham speaks to itv news he continued the move was contradictory that measures to shield the clinically vulnerable were coming to an end when coronavirus cases in some areas were rising now is not the time for penny pinching mr burnham added he continued that shielding measures have remained in place in leicester and blackburn which have both seen a tightening of lockdown measures in the last few weeks adding this should be put in to place in other areas under tougher measures he continued that more needs to be done to supporter lower paid workers so that they are financially able to self isolate and stop the spread of coronavirus the 50-year old said he supported the government 's decision to impose tougher

the crisis ministers failed to equip care homes with sufficient testing and ppe whilst discharging patients with the virus into their homes a dhsc spokesperson said it is completely wrong to suggest care homes were deliberately deprived of testing resources and any care home resident or member of staff with symptoms can immediately access a free test we continue to issue at least 50,000 tests a day to care homes across the country and prioritise tests for higher risk outbreak areas a combination of factors have meant that a more limited number of testing kits predominantly used in care homes

instructing people to wash their hands cover their face and keep to a social distance he said the he only real utensil people have in controlling the spread of covid-19 is human behaviour and the only way we can encourage people to behave in one way or the other is to through advice that was pretty punchy i think hands face space and get a test he said i think everybody can more or less remember

under control on saturday august 1 you ll remember we had hoped to reopen a number of the higher risk settings that had remained closed and today i m saying were postponing those changes for at least

banned from meeting each other indoors from midnight on friday it has caused huge disruption for thousands of muslims who had been hoping to celebrate eid this evening at the homes of their family and friends earlier health secretary matt hancock defended the swift new measures saying it was important to move fast late on thursday evening with no action at all the virus doubles every three days so it is is important to move fast and sometimes that means communicating very rapidly he told itv news but the muslim council of britain has criticised the government for its lack of communication which has caused disruption for muslims around the country who had been hoping to meet with family this weekend the group 's secretary general harun khan said for muslims in the affected areas it is like being told they can not visit family and friends for christmas on christmas eve itself failure to communicate makes it difficult for communities across the country to continue working together to minimise the spread of the virus whilst eroding trust in the ability of authorities to steer our course as we tackle the covid-19 crisis watch boris johnson 's press conference in full mr johnson said he understood that the latest announcement would be a real blow to people who had wedding plans or those who can no longer celebrate eid in the ways they would wish i m really really sorry about that but we simply can not take the risk we will of course study the data carefully and move forward with our intention to open up as soon as we possibly can he said the stricter measures wereannounced via mr hancocks twitter feed at around 9pmand later posted online the health secretary also gave an interview explaining the rule change labour leader sir keir starmer also criticised the government 's

course as we tackle the covid-19 crisis he added the uk government has failed to provide clarity on the shockingly short notice and the reasoning behind the new rules that british muslims deserve any such clarification would be most welcome mr hancock confirmed the new restrictions sadly mean that people wo n't be able to have that household engagement people going to meet in each other 's houses or gardens because we 've seen that 's how the disease spreads but he said muslims will be able to go to mosques to celebrate itv news political correspondent libby wiener asked whether it made any sense for mosque celebrations to be allowed given the possibility that several households could all be inside one at the same time mr hancock said it does make sense because the imams have worked so hard to find socially distanced covid secure ways of having eid celebrations he added we 've been clear all along that we 're willing to take action where that 's needed and its a very difficult balance it 's difficult judgements these are not easy decisions mr hancock defended the government communication saying the message of a rule change was spread in all ways possible as soon as practical i explained the decision in an interview last night also on social media making sure that we get the message out as far and as fast as we can he said labour leader sir keir starmer also criticised the government 's communication writing on twitter he said despite poor communication from the government its crucial that we all follow the advice to help prevent another outbreak the stricter measures announced via mr hancocks twitter feed at around 9 pm and later posted online mean members of different households are not be able to meet indoors reacting to the announcement an imam told itv news he was concerned for the waste from all the food that has been prepared bilal ali said i think the food that has been cooked by the cooked and prepared by all of the women in the households of the muslim community i think the government can and i should share that food with us because i do n't know what we 're going to with it added that he would have liked to have seen more family and friends during eid celebrations but will now only be spending the day with immediate family where has the government imposed stricter coronavirus restrictions the restrictions which came into force at midnight cover the whole of greater manchester as well as the east lancashire boroughs of blackburn with darwen burnley pendle rossendale and hyndburn it means many muslims in northern england will not be able to celebrate eid with their family which began just hours after the announcement saima afzal a community inclusion activist and blackburn councillor said the government left it too late to impose the restrictions she said people in the lancashire town had already been warned against visiting households when it became clear to the council that infection rates were on the rise the issue for me is the timing it 's really unfortunate ms afzal said does n't matt hancock see the potential impact two hours before eid i 'm not saying he 's intended it but why were n't areas told in advance they knew where the data was going the lack of clarity for every community not just muslims it 's so last minute the health secretary said test and trace data has shown most of the transmission is happening between households and between people visiting family and friends one of the terrible things about this virus is it thrives on the sort of social contact that makes life worth living and that is a serious problem with the virus he said on friday housing secretary robert jenrick tweeted following the announcement on new local restrictions i want to reassure british muslims in impacted areas that mosques are still allowed to open for congregational prayer however worshippers should avoid large gatherings worshippers are free to attend the mosque if they wish but in a socially distanced and covid-19 secure way mosques have guidance as to how to do this and were doing so prior to these restrictions eid al adha also called eid qurban or bakra eid is the second of two islamic holidays and considered to be the holiest the celebrations last for four days and the dates based on the islamic lunar calendar shift every year this year eid which means feast or

prevalence of coronavirus likely to be rising for the first time since may the prime minister gave a press conference in downing street to announce a change in tack after spikes in covid-19 cases in the north west of england resulted in a tightening of restrictions there but he suggested its not enough to just actlocally coronavirus spikes see brakes applied to easing of england 's lockdown separate households banned from meeting in parts of northern england coronavirus restrictions for the north west what you can and ca n't do it is also my responsibility to look again at the measures

to keep the virus under control as such several planned easings have been scrapped until august 15 at the earliest casinos bowling alleys skating rinksand other close contact services must remain closed the government had been planning to move to the next phase of lifting lockdown on august 1 by reopening of higher risk settings he said that easing will not go ahead for at least another two

weekend but ceremonies will be allowed to continue so long as the venue is following covid secure guidelines i know that the steps we are taking will be a real blow to many people to everyone whose wedding plans have been disrupted the prime minister said and i m really really sorry about that but we can not simply take the risk face coverings will be mandatory in more indoor settings from august 8 mr johnson said it would be made compulsory for people to wear face coverings in places where people are likely to come into contact with others they do not normally meet it means from august

in history it will be a great embarrassment to the usa delay the election until people can properly securely and safely vote oliver stone on donald trump there is something vastly wrong with his ego the unsubstantiated claim from trump comes as he lags behind democratic rival joe biden in the polls ahead of novembers presidential election an average poll of polls by fivethirtyeight.com puts biden on 50 % with trump lagging behind on 41.7 % the dates of federal elections are set by the us congress and the countrys constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the january 20 2021 presidential inauguration there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud through postal voting even in states with all mail votes five states already rely exclusively on postal votes and they say they have necessary safeguards in place to ensure that a hostile foreign actor does not disrupt the vote election security experts say that all forms of voter fraud are rare including absentee balloting the tweet also comes after a day of bad economic news for the us with government reports showing the economy shrank 32.9 % annual rate in the april june quarter the worst fall on record tens of millions of americans have been left unemployed by the coronavirus crisis with 14.7 % currently without a job mr trump has increasingly sought to cast doubt on novembers election and the expected surge in

trump has called remote voting options the biggest risk to his re - election his campaign and the republican party have sued to combat the practice which was once a significant advantage for the republicans last month trump told supporters in arizona that this will be in my opinion the most corrupt election in the history of our country in april trump had ruled out the prospect of trying to change the election i never even thought of changing the date of the election he said why would i do that november 3rd its a good number no i look forward to that election i m not thinking about it at all he added not at all attorney general william barr speaking to a house committee earlier this week claimed there was a high risk that mail in voting would lead to massive fraud he said he had no reason to think the upcoming election would be rigged but he said he believed if you have wholesale mail in voting it substantially increases the risk of fraud during the hearing barr was asked about comments he made last month over foreign interference in the election through phony ballots he said he did nt have evidence that foreign countries could use them to change the outcome of an election

and protecting public health nicola sturgeon has confirmed schools in scotland will return on a full time basis after the summer break but with pupils having been away from school for almost five months she said some councils may adopt a phased approach to the return the first minister said it is a moral and educational imperative that we get children back to school as soon as is safely possible in fact a key reason for our cautious approach to lockdown over the last two months and over the next few weeks is a determination to drive the virus down and keep prevalence low so that schools can reopen in august i am therefore pleased to confirm today that schools will return fromaugust 11 given how long children have been out of school some local authorities may opt for a phased return over the first few days but we expect all pupils to be at school full time fromaugust 18 at the latest to help schools ms sturgeon announced extra cash to recruit more teachers and for measures such as enhanced cleaning i can also confirm that in addition to the 45 million previously announced we will make a further 30 million available to support the recruitment of additional teachers ms

already announced as part of a 50 million education recovery fund for local authorities this will support extra cleaning facilities management school transport and other practical measures that are

first minister said the virus was still circulating as a result of that she said scotland could not yet move into the fourth and final phase of easing lockdown restrictions ms sturgeon said a move to phasefour would require us to be satisfied that the virus is no longer considered a significant threat to public health unfortunately that is far from the case ms sturgeon said non - essential offices

see the workforce grow by 29 % by 2021 according to the ministry of justice moj and comes as prime minister boris johnson backed a continued recruitment drive across the public sector including police teachers and nhs staff some 800 probation officers are already in training and an extra 1,000 will be in training by january 1 the department said the programme of reform includes plans to use artificial intelligence ai to help probation officers and hiring ex - offenders as part of efforts to build a more diverse workforce according to a report the news comes as the government prepares to bring all probation services monitoring all offenders on licence and serving community sentences in england and wales back entirely under public control next year after inspectors said there were fundamental flaws in part privatising the system routine safety checks on offenders were not being carried out as officers buckled under overwhelming workloads inspectors previously warned there have also been concerns raised that probation officers lack professional curiosity which could see them miss warning signs that offenders are failing to reform probation must learn from failings to prevent more tragedies inspector warns probation officers do not understand risk to public in too many cases earlier this year inspectors found serial rapist joseph mccann carried out a series of sex attacks after being freed from prison following major failings by an unstable team of inexperienced probation staff a three year plan promises better training and to balance the workloads of frontline staff in efforts to help cut reoffending rates new it systems will be developed to give staff more time to focus on working directly with offenders and better support schemes like counselling will be made available officers will be provided with the best tools to make informed decisions well including ai and by 2022/23 this will provide data which aids professional experience and judgment the government report said a register will also be set up to keep tabs on staff qualifications and to ensure more professional accountability like making sure employees are completing required training efforts are also being made to make the workforce more diverse and hiring people with broad and varied life experience according to the moj document it said new methods would be used to select the most capable candidates regardless of their background and this would include ex - offenders where appropriate earlier this year an inspection report said bosses needed to review their approach to recruitment to better address the underrepresentation of black asian minority ethnic and male staff in the workplace women make up most of the workforce and it is thought the types of qualifications sought in previous job adverts may have been a factor in this ian lawrence general secretary of the probation officers union napo said there are massive staff shortages across the country that has led to dangerously high caseloads inexperienced staff being allocated work beyond the training and deterioration in professionalism we welcome this news but it must be matched in its ambition with a full review of the training a review of the level of pay our members receive and a significant redress of systemic failures that has seen a deterioration in the effectiveness of probation officials warned

expected to be increased from seven to 10 days the announcement comes amid fears of a second spike of the virus and an ongoing row over 14-day quarantine measures put in place for travellers returning from spain the deputy chief medical officer for england professor jonathan van tam is expected to announce the change in advice which currently states those with symptoms should isolate for at least seven days speaking on thursday morning health secretary matt hancock did not deny the extension of the isolation period this is a decision that 's clinically led mr hancock told sky news the chief medical officer will be setting out details later today i ca n't steal his thunder but what i will say is we will always do what is necessary to protect people and we 're guided by the clinical judgment by the science in this the health secretary also warned that a second wave of coronavirus is starting to roll across europe we 've got to do everything we can to prevent it from reaching these shores and to tackle it mr hancock said the measures that the chief medical officer will set out later are part of that but so too are the measures we 're taking for instance to ensure that we do n't directly bring cases back to this country where there 's a big spike in cases advice for those who have been in close contact with someone with the virus will remain unchanged guidance from the nhs also said that people must self isolate for 14 days if you live with or are in a bubble with someone that has symptoms those who are contacted by nhs test and trace must also quarantine for 14 days the latest figures for the programme will be published later health bosses have warned of very high levels of concern about the possibility of a second spike in coronavirus cases itv news science editor tom clarke says the government is also looking at reducing the 14 day isolation period for people who do n't have symptoms but may have come into contact with someone who has niall dickson chief executive of the nhs confederation said that the combination of a spike of cases with exhausted staff while the nhs tries to rebuild services could prove challenging he told the all party parliamentary group appg on coronavirus i would say in relation to the second spike issue or something coming the levels of concern among our members the people who are leading nhs trusts who are leading in primary care and all levels in the systems is very high there s real concern about winter and the compounding factors there but also about an earlier spike who young people could be fuelling coronavirus spikes amid second wave warnings ca n't rule out more quarantines ' grant shapps warns of further disruption as covid concerns raised across europe also on thursday mr hancock will make a speech in which he will set out what the government is calling the nhs people plan which includes suggestions staff could use messaging services such as whatsapp so patients can have quick and easy access to information flexible working more regular staff morale surveys and a requirement for nhs trusts and clinical commissioning groups to publish progress reports on black and ethnic minority representation within the workforce are also among the plans the announcement comes as health bosses warn of very high levels of concern about the possibility of a second spike in coronavirus cases the move also follows a diplomatic row over the requirement that travellers from spain would have to quarantine for a period of 14 days on their arrival into the uk mr hancock also told sky news that ministers are investigating ways to reduce the 14-day quarantine period for new arrivals to the uk from at risk countries this is very much guided by the clinical science and the cmo chief medical officer will be speaking on it later today but the broader point is that there 's a serious concern about a second wave that 's clearly now moving across europe and we need to take action if that means increasing the number of days that people who test positive have to self isolate then so be it because these measures are necessary to keep people safe speaking on his return to the uk on wednesday having cut short a family holiday in spain transport secretary grant shapps said he could not rule out more countries being added to the list of nations under the governments quarantine restrictions he told reporters we absolutely have to act the moment we get the information and that s exactly what happened with spain as we saw and as we ve seen over the weekend where there was over 6,100 cases the highest since the peak in march over there it was the right thing to do and its why the whole of the uk did it at the same time i ca nt therefore rule out other countries having to go into the quarantine as well video report by itv news political correspondent paul brand the majority of care homes in england wo nt fully reopen to visitors despite a change in the governments guidance a survey has suggested the survey carried out for itv news by the national care association found most homes will allow families to see their residents outdoors but not indoors as the advice is altered across the country last week the government said that local authorities together with care home managers could decide locally whether to reopen care homes with most residents having last seen their families in early march while the advice is that outdoor visits are preferable it also allows for indoor visits from the same one family member if ppe is worn which would allow residents to see their relatives during the winter months however a survey of 41 care providers for itv news found the vast majority will not fully reopen while most will allow outdoor visits only 8 said they would permit people to come inside 26 providers said the government advice was nt clear with only 15 saying they fully understood it in sheffield palms row health care director nicola richards is building pods for residents to meet their relatives outside but is refusing entry to the home given what many providers have been through we 're extremely nervous about opening up to visiting at the moment she said we want to open up but there 's issues around that which we 're worried about she added itv news filmed the touching moment one care home resident in bolton was reunited with her daughter for the first time in four months deborah fisher said it felt like she had won the pools being able to sit with her daughter while she still misses her grandchildren terribly she it was wonderful to be able to sit with her daughter in a gazebo set up outside her care home but indoor visits are particularly important for many residents who have mobility issues or are bed bound almost all of them have been unable to see their families for five months now except for in very rare circumstances there is anecdotal evidence from care homes that those with dementia have suffered especially with the lack of contact worsening their condition in bolton farnworth care home regional operations directorsarah willets has built a visitors room indoors with painstaking precautions including a dividing screen ppe constant sanitising and temperature checks to eliminate as much risk as possible but she believes its a balance she says visits from loved ones are so important for residents at her home it affects their health and wellbeing how they feel about themselves she said and the last few months have been difficult at the moment our top priority is still preventing the transmission of covid-19 but we also need to balance that with the health and wellbeing of our residents so we 've built these visitors rooms to keep them as safe as possible but also enable those face to face visits she said staff at her home are doing everything they can to minimise the risk of infection by providing ppe doing full screening on visitors before meeting residents and following all the guidelines we believe that the transmission risk is as low as we can possibly make it whilst balancing the wellbeing of the residents there are also concerns among care home managers about insurance policies not covering coronavirus infections and deaths our survey has confirmed the worries are widespread 35 respondents said they were concerned their policy would n't cover residents or visitors becoming infected while 32 said their policies would not cover any claims made over deaths relating to coronavirus nicola shared her concerns about care providers being unable to find cover upon renewal she said we 're raising this at a national and local level but we are worried that exclusions apply to care homes at the minute which is really unhelpful and will force lockdown for a longer period of time we can get renewal for insurance it 's the renewals around covid at the minute that are causing problems for many providers she added she believes the issue around insurance is being ignored at the moment and says that should have been a priority before we then allow visiting back into care homes by issuing guidance for care home visits without addressing insurance concerns sarah believes the government put pressure on providers to open sooner than they should do reporting on the crisis in care homes from paul brand thousands more may have died with coronavirus without being diagnosed data reveals itv news reveals plans to discharge covid-19 patients into care homes exclusive 50 % rise in children referred to care during coronavirus pandemic however our survey reveals that trust between the government and the care sector has deteriorated to such a degree that many homes are reluctant to follow the advice to reopen 33 care providers told us they did nt think the government had handled the crisis well only 7 said it had and today an influential committee of mps agreed the public accounts committee concluded that care homes have been thrown to the wolves by the government highlighting a lack of ppe and testing of patients discharged from hospitals committee chair meg hillier told itv news the care sector was an afterthought for ministers when planning the coronavirus response the labour mp said care homes were used to support the nhs but did not receive proper support themselves in terms of ppe testing or guidelines from the government she says a lack of understanding around infection control in care homes was a critical factor in what led to the crisis in care homes it was reckless not to plan for that in advance you take a decision in one area it will have a knock on impact elsewhere this knock on effect was devastating and people lost their lives as a result she said ministers have rejected the criticisms of the pac report with culture secretary oliver dowden defending the government by saying there were 40 % less discharges from hospitals into care homes than the previous year i do n't accept the characterisation of the public accounts committee he told itv news releasing patients to care homes without coronavirus tests a reckless and appalling error we were in the middle of a pandemic and we were being accused of checking people out of hospitals into care homes carrying covid actually there were fewer people discharged from hospital into care homes during that period than in the previous year he said he appeared to concede errors had been made but said they were addressed immediately of course there were challenges in care homes and we accepted those challenges we 've accepted there were lessons to learn and indeed we took action immediately death has not been the only damaging aspect of the coronavirus crisis in care homes one resident told us today that covid-19 had left him feeling trapped in a prison as winter approaches each home must strike a balance between locking out the virus without making its residents feel locked in a department of health and social care spokesperson said the survey was of a tiny fraction of care providers and therefore not representative they added we have worked hard with the care sector putting an extra 1.3 billion in to support the hospital discharge process providing 172 million items of ppe and testing all residents and staff including repeat testing for staff and residents in care homes for over 65 or those with dementia we know how important it is for families and friends to be able to visit their loved ones and the latest guidance sets out how families and residents can safely come together again as an artist and critic of the chinese government ai weiwei has had plenty to think about right now its security crackdown in hong kong its treatment of the uighur people and its handling of the coronavirus pandemic for a start mr weiwei told itv news presenter tom bradby if china is n't challenged now its repression will only continue he said i think the west should never underestimate china china is a state with clear ambition and a very clear vision and a very clear strategy in dealing with the west chris patten chinese government is behaving in aggressive and loutish ' way china uk will bear the consequences of suspending hong kong extradition mr weiwei added and so in that case the west can not really measure and cope with the challenge of china and the chinese government feel they are stronger than ever in controlling the domestic issues when asked by tom bradby whether he sees any hope left for some kind of rebellion against this repression from within china mr weiwei said to be very honest and on the record and to be clear i do nt see there s any force that can challenge china from within china you know certainly there s individual minds but those minds once they express their feelings they re either in jail or being punished in some other way mr weiwei continued so that is showing clear mindset of this kind of totalitarian control they do nt believe what they re saying and they know that we also do nt believe it but that function works i can tell you this kind of evil method of controlling can last for hundreds of years but if without a really major problem to stop them to develop they will last

uk and china why does n't britain trust huawei and what does the ban mean for me almost every new chief of the secret intelligence service must deal with the backdrop of a world moving faster than the one their predecessor faced on their day one but the current pace of technological change means that when richard moore begins his new role this autumn his priorities may well have had to change from those he presented at his job interview he will need to oversee mi6s place in a technological arms race with hostile states the current c alex younger speaking in 2018 identified the need for british intelligence agencies need to innovate faster in a rare public speech he said much of the evolving state threat is about our opponents increasingly innovative exploitation of modern technology russia report government underestimated threat and clearly let us down by not probing brexit meddling when moore joined the service the first time round in 1987 spycraft looked quite different even though the agency was dealing with some of the same enemies it faces today many of his priorities for 2020 will be predictable though some will be decided by politicians rather than spies china and russia will surely be close to the top of the list but there s another aspect to his job which is downplayed in the bond movies his role as a political and diplomatic figure dealing with whitehall and downing street with unfriendly states and with britains international partners in post - brexit britain the uks relationship with intelligence agencies in europe will receive even more focus and so will the office of c. after his last spell with the service moore served in several public roles as an ambassador in turkey and in a senior position at the foreign office his cv offers a hint of some

the growing concern around coronavirus in belgium and luxembourg while it closely monitors the situation in croatia after imposing quarantines on returnees from spain mr shapps told reporters on his return to the uk from spain that the decision to impose quarantines was the right thing to do pointing out how spain had experienced its highest rise in cases since the peak in march who young people could be fuelling coronavirus spikes amid second wave warnings the transport secretary who confirmed he will self isolate for two weeks after arriving home explained how he was forced to act swiftly on spain with a huge jump in cases between friday and saturday he said we absolutely have to act the moment we get the information and that s exactly what happened with spain as we saw and as we ve seen over the weekend where there was over 6,100 cases the highest since the peak in march over there it was the right thing to do and its why the whole of the uk did it at the same time i ca nt therefore rule out other countries having to go into the quarantine as well this weekboris johnson warned there are signs of a second wave in parts of the continent the prime minister during a visit

require that travellers from spain to the uk isolate for 14 days he said i very much understand the frustrations it obviously had an impact on me and my family and i m very very sorry and upset for the thousands of brits who are either away or perhaps even have nt managed to go away this summer as well to spain shapps on spain 's jump in coronavirus cases and the need for swift action but its absolutely essential we acted when we did its why all four nations of the united kingdom acted together and the figures since have turned out to justify that action we have to i think have a clear message and make sure that we act by adding entire countries to that list for the time being he said the exclusion of certain spanish islands from the measures taken by the uk government had been considered but was eventually ruled out following concerns from the chief medical officer shapps on the discussion around spain 's islands chris whitty the chief medical officer was very clear with us that he was concerned about the data we d seen how the data had come very fast forward in spain in 20 48 hours it had gone up by 75 % it had doubled in just a few days he was concerned to see what was

announcement andrew flintham managing director of tui uk and ireland described the current advice as a little bit interesting shall we say he told itv news one of the things as an industry we 're asking for and certainly at tui we 're asking for is that we make it simple for customers because you 've got this confusing picture where the travel advice says you can go but you have to quarantine that 's quite a confusing picture to try and explain to somebody mr flintham said the company was calling for a regionalised structure to quarantine advice based on levels of infections in different areas rather than the country as a whole he added we do n't want to take anyone anywhere where potentially they 're going to be unsafe that 's the last thing we want to do but we think there may be

must take their own decisions as to whether they want to risk holidaying abroad this year after his shock announcement on spain caused huge disruption for many these are decisions for families for individuals about where they want to go he said the prime minister said the quarantine measures were aimed at stopping cases being brought in to the uk its vital that when people are coming back from abroad if they are coming back from a place where i m afraid there is another outbreak they must go into quarantine that s why we have taken the action that we have and we will continue throughout the summer to take such action where it is necessary scotlands first minister nicola sturgeon says people should very cautious about going abroad on holiday and should consider having a holiday at home spain 's prime minister has labelled the quarantine rules disproportionate with british travellers a huge contributing factor in the country 's economy itv news science editor on how real the prospect of a second wave is with spain 's deflated economy relying so heavily on tourism britons make up a fifth of foreign visitors to spain its leader pedro sanchez has been keen for foreigners to return he acknowledged there are two two worrying outbreaks on the mainland but said holiday islands like the balearics and the canaries are safe to visit he said the move was an error by the uk government and questioned the logic of quarantines for arrivals from spain claiming much of spain 's coronavirus rates were lower than the uk 's in the great majority of the spanish territory it is very low lower in fact than the rate in the uk he said minister simon clarke explained why the islands had been included in advice to avoid all but essential travel to spain saying transfers between the two areas made it unsafe the government 's advice is clear that you should n't travel to any part of spain he added with the pm 's spokesman 's warning that no travel is risk free mr sanchez might not be the only aggrieved leader disappointed with the uk france germany and several other destinations currently considered safe for travel are experiencing spikes of covid-19 in some areas leaving a dark cloud hanging over many summer holiday plans the government says disruption is possible for anyone 's travel plans during the pandemic anyone travelling abroad should be aware that our travel advice and exemption list is under constant review as we monitor the international situation the pm 's spokesman warned number 10 says border measures and travel advice can be changed rapidly in order to protect the uk from coronavirus labour criticised the chaotic nature of the decision making regarding spain with the rule change being announced just hours before it came into force the shock travel advice

was transport secretary grant shapps whose department for transport made the announcement just hours after he flew to spain meaning he ill also have to quarantine upon his return to the uk in mr shapps case job security amid his enforced quarantine probably is n't an issue but there are thousands of holidaymakers now having to reconsider their trips due to the loss of earnings they will incur due to 14 days away from work for many people unable to work from home that is the reality the government wants employers to be flexible with staff forced to quarantine but it is not offering any additional support itself to people forced out of work it ruled out extending statutory sick pay to those in quarantine but said some people may be able to apply for help through universal credit mr clarke said the government is relying on people exercising good judgement and common sense regarding quarantine rules but said there is a measure of enforcement when people arrive in the uk they will have to fill out a form detailing where they will be isolating with random inspections set to be carried out by public health england mr clarke said there will be hundreds of these spot checks every day professor mike lewis a professor of life sciences at the university of birmingham said the governments blanket 14-day quarantine on those arriving from spain was due to a failure to deliver and effective test and trace system in the uk he said with a peak of 50,000 arriving passengers into the uk per day from spain and a spanish infection rate of 39 people in 100,000 we could hypothesise this new isolation mandate would halt 18 new inbound cases of covid per day coming into the country from inbound spanish flights when the uk is at 800 - 1,000 new cases per day this number seems fairly meagre by comparison the economic impact on airlines airports tour operators hotels restaurants in spain and the uk will be dramatic for spain professor lewis non - executive chairman of mygp

said that an apology from then home secretary amber rudd was a good thing but added what about all the other people who were sent away before my case became big she went on its just upsetting to think that an ordinary person like me could go through something like that i m still going through hell at the moment its really hard for me to put it in words i m still hurt i m still hurt that s all i can say on the news of ms wilson 's death mr vernon said it 's a complete shock she died a broken woman that 's all i can say he also praised her activism saying ms wilson inspired hundreds if not thousands of other people caught up in the windrush scandal to tell their story he added if it was n't for all those stories we would n't have had the scandal and exposed the government and the

windrush generation working group will right the wrongs of scandal patel says video report by itv news political correspondent dan hewitt boris johnson is urging overweight people to go on a diet this summer ahead of reported crackdown on junk food advertising the prime minister who is himself on a diet and exercising more said losing weight is frankly one of the ways that you can reduce your own risks from covid actually it 's one of the ways you can generally protect your health and protect the nhs mr johnson who has lost a stone in weight since falling critically ill with coronavirus is reportedly set to target junk food adverts by banning them before the 9 pm tv watershed as part of his health drive for the uk rule changes are yet to be announced but along with stopping junk food adverts until after 9 pm ministers are also reported to be planning bans on online ads for unhealthy foods and restaurants could be forced to put calorie information on their menus it 's believed the government is also considering limiting in store promotions free flu jab programme widened this winter worst case scenario could see 120,000 covid-19 deaths this winter scientists in an interview at an nhs gp surgery the pm hinted a change was on its way i m not normally a believer in nannying or bossying type of politics he admitted but said the reality is that obesity is one of the real comorbidity factors it 's believed mr johnson 's period in intensive care with coronavirus has been a contributing factor in his health drive for the uk health and social care minister helen whatley did not confirm reports on junk food but told the bbc an announcement was due imminently she added particularly with covid you are at greater risk of getting it at greater risk of complications at greater risk of sadly dying from covid if you are overweight as it is such an important health challenge we have to take it on and the pm is committed to making sure we tackle obesity jodie rigby mee lost 38 kg using slimming world she says banning ads could really help during the visit to a medical centre in east london prime minister johnson was filmed describing people opposed to vaccines as nuts he said because there s all these anti - vaxxers now they are nuts the prime minister is also encouraging everybody to get a flu jab in the run up to this winter as part of his campaign to protect the nhs and avoid it becoming overwhelmed should coronavirus still be a major health risk later in the year he believes by the middle of next year we will be well on the way we will be well on the way past the covid-19 pandemic but warned there are still tough times ahead he said we want everybody to get a flu jab in the run up to this winter and that s why were rolling out the biggest ever programme of flu immunisation and were aiming first of all for schoolchildren up to year 7 for pregnant women for people over 65 for people who are shielded but then we will be extending it to people who are 50 to 65 now the reason for doing this is to protect the nhs in the winter months because obviously we have still got covid we have still got the threat of a second spike on covid and its vital therefore to keep that pressure off the nhs by everybody getting a flu jab and i really hope everybody will boris johnson has admitted he 's made mistakes during his first year in office and has apologised for not saying sorry very often the prime minister who is marking one year since becoming prime minister on friday said of course there are things we get wrong but added he 's learning the whole time you 've got to learn from your mistakes as fast as possible mr johnson said during an interview at an nhs gp surgery in east london when asked if he finds it hard to say sorry the prime minister appeared both amused and shocked before saying i 'm sorry if i do n't apologise despite admitting errors have taken place mr johnson said it would be invidious to single out any particular mistake more vaguely he said there are aspects of the way government works that really need to be faster and more responsive to the needs of the people boris johnson 's dramatic first year in power including brexit a baby and a brush with death anti - vaxxers are nuts says prime minister boris johnson mr johnson said he wants people to stop thinking of coronavirus as something that makes it impossible to do things as he outlined an ambition to speed up the running of government services if you look at particularly what 's happening now you 've got this problem of backlog britain he said so you 've got people not being able to get their passports in time people not being able to get birth certificates huge problems of backlogs cases not going through the courts fast enough he said that 's something ministers and civil servants should be bending our wills to solving i want to see a massive effort now by the country to psychologically to stop thinking of coronavirus as something that makes it impossible to do things and start really looking at tackling the problems of the british people how to get the things that they want in double time so that s why we ve set up project speed so one of the things i ve learnt is sometimes government can be slow and unresponsive and sometimes we need to go faster later in an interview with bbc he said conceded that the government did not understand covid-19 sufficiently in its first few weeks and months and admitted there were things which they could have done differently the pm said we did nt understand the virus in the way that we would have liked in the first few weeks and months and i think probably the single thing that we did nt see at the beginning was the extent to which it was being transmitted asymptomatically from person to person i think its fair to say that there are things that we need to learn about how we handled it in the early stages there will be plenty of opportunities to learn the lessons of what happened labours shadow health secretary jonathan ashworth has said the pm 's comments she he has finally admitted the government has mishandled its response to the coronavirus responding he said this finally puts to bed the prime ministers previous claim his government took the right decisions at the right time he added it was too slow to acknowledge the threat of the virus too slow to enter lockdown and too slow to take this crisis seriously the threat of a second wave is still very real it is imperative the government learns the lessons of its mistakes so we can help to save lives he said he hopes by the middle of next year we will be well on the way past the coronavirus pandemic but warned there are still tough times ahead i must be clear with people he said i do still think that we have tough times ahead in keeping this virus under control we have tough times ahead in coming through economically but i have absolutely no doubt that we are going to and this country is going to bounce back stronger than ever before mr johnson is desperate for the economy to bounce back quickly but he 's urging people to remain cautious when outside their homes he said social distancing measures and face covering guidance will remain in place until we 've made a lot more progress our ability to dispense with the social distancing measures will depend on our continued ability to drive down the virus he declined to provide a timetable for a lifting of measures but said we need to make sure that we 've really really got it under control we 're able to stamp on local outbreaks and we 've really greatly reduced the risk of a second spike he said coronavirus is under control in this country to a very large extent but it is still there if you look at what is happening in other countries there is clearly a risk that it could come back again slimmed down boris johnson ' eyeing junk food advertising crackdown free flu jab programme widened this winter who will be eligible for vaccine video report by itv news consumer correspondent chris choi people will need to wear a face covering in sandwich shops in england under new regulations due to come into force on friday it will also be mandatory to wear a face covering in shopping centres banks takeaway outlets and supermarkets under the new regulations health secretary matt hancock urged the public to play their part in fighting this virus by following this new guidance as the government sought to clarify confusion over face coverings by publishing new regulations on thursday less than 24 hours before they come into effect the department of health and social care confirmed face coverings will be needed in shops such as pret a manger if people intend to take their food and coffee away if they sit down to eat or drink customers will be able to remove their face covering in that area and it is likely takeaway outlets will fall under the same criteria government minister brandon lewis told itv news if you 're going in to buy your sandwich or your coffee and leaving again you 're treating it as a retail environment and you should be wearing a mask he added but if you 're staying there to eat and drink then practicality means yes you can take your mask off because then you 're there as a hospitality venue rather than a retail venue that 's the simplest way to think of it mr lewis also clarified the regulations around face coverings generally when you go into a supermarket or retail environment you should be wearing a mask the government has been accused of creating confusion over whether face coverings must be worn in sandwich shops and takeaways after rishi sunak was pictured wearing a face covering in sandwich chain pret a manger but michael gove was not but will shops be made to enforce the guidance while shops supermarkets indoor shopping centres and transport hubs banks building societies and post offices all fall under the new regulations wearing a face covering in places such as restaurants and pubs hairdressers gyms leisure centres cinemas concert halls and theatres will not be mandatory prime minister boris johnson said it was the right thing to do to make masks mandatory in shops at this stage as the science has become clearer on their usefulness the purpose of the masks is to stop any of us transmitting the virus to anybody else it 's a mutually beneficial thing and it 's the right thing to do in shops in confined spaces where you 're in company with people you do n't normally meet and also of course on public transport he said "there 's been dispute i think amongst the scientists over the course of the pandemic about the utility of the mask but the advice is getting clearer and clearer that they can be of benefit so we 're saying wear them in shops wear them on public transport kevin duffy director of centre mk shopping centre in milton keynes told itv news he does nt think its likely that many people will turn up to shops refusing to wear face masks and that he expects most people will play their part the same exemptions as for public transport will apply to wearing a face covering in shops with children under 11 and people with breathing problems not required to wear one anyone who can not put on wear or remove a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or impairment or disability is also exempt the government has been urged to do more to protect people exempt from wearing a face covering after a charity highlighted horrific cases of disabled people being abused fazilet hadi a policy manager at disability rights uk said she has already heard several stories of people being confronted on public transport where masks have been mandatory since june despite having legitimate reasons for not wearing one how to wear face masks a government spokesperson said the guidance is absolutely clear that you do not need to wear a face covering if you have a legitimate reason not to including because of a physical or mental illness or impairment or disability we expect people to be sensitive to the fact that some groups of people are not able to wear a face covering and will continue to communicate this message to the general public the public are advised to wash their hands before putting a covering or mask on or taking it off and to avoid touching their eyes nose or mouth while wearing one face coverings should be stored in a plastic bag until they can be washed or disposed of the department of health said the government said the responsibility for wearing a face covering sits with individuals adding businesses are encouraged to take reasonable steps to encourage customers to follow the law including through signs and providing other information in store itv news correspondent paul davies on why shops are relying on polite notices to help encourage customers to wear face mask mr hancock announced on july 14 that wearing a face covering in shops and supermarkets will be compulsory from friday july 24 with anyone failing to comply facing a fine of up to 100 the opposition has accused ministers of making things up as they go along over takeaways and sandwich shops the latest changes will bring bring england into line with scotland where face coverings are already mandatory in shops liberal democrat health spokesperson munira wilson said that with just a day to go to the new guidance being enforced the government was in a mess people need a government that can offer genuine reassurances and steer the country to safety she said after all clear communication is critical in a public health crisis instead this confusion on guidance shows ministers simply could not organise a bun fight in a bakery all this stinks of ministers making it up as they go along instead of listening to the experts the government must urgently provide the clarity businesses need to operate and people need to feel safe former head of the civil service lord odonnell told peers on wednesday the government needed to improve its communications giving evidence to the lords public services committee he said if anyone knows what the clear message on masks is please tell me what are the new rules around face coverings in england where must i wear one and can i be fined for not wearing one confusion over sandwich shop mask use after gove seen without face covering prime minister boris johnson

only uk fishers to use british waters mr frost said the eus proposals so far while a welcome response to the prime ministers statement do not do so and therefore substantial areas of disagreement remain he said several agreements had been reached notably on transport and participation in eu programmes but he added considerable gaps remain in the most difficult areas that is the so called level playing field and on fisheries mr barnier said there is objectively a risk of a deal not being reached with the uks position on fisheries is simply unacceptable he said on fisheries the uk is effectively seeking for near total exclusion of fishing vessels from the uks water that is simply unacceptable mr barnier said considerable gaps remain between the uk and eu on the so called level playing field arrangements he added this week again the uk did not show a willingness to break the deadlock on the level playing field the uk still refuses to commit to maintaining high standards in a meaningful way on state aid despite a clear warning in the political declaration very clear we have made no progress at all this is all the more worrying because we have no visibility on the uks intention on its future domestic subsidy control system and regime the idea of a level playing field is designed to ensure fairness between the two sides in areas such as labour environment climate sustainable development and subsidy control grant shapps seeks to discredit russia report because it was written by remainer dominic grieve ' uk 's new start let 's get going brexit information campaign warns holidaymakers of travel changes he said the eu and uk have until october at the latest to strike a deal or risk the imposition of quotas and tariffs he said if we do not reach an agreement on our future partnership there will be far more friction but mr frost 's statement shows no sign of any desire to compromise on the three principles outlined by the pm he said we have always been clear that our principles in these areas are not simple negotiating positions but expressions of the reality that we will be a fully independent country at the end of the transition period the negotiator and close boris johnson ally said there has been constructive discussions on trade in goods and services adding how he will keep working hard to bridge the gaps and find a way through mr barnier said if an agreement is n't reached on trade new tariffs and quotas will be inevitable this is the truth of brexit and i will continue to tell the truth if we want to avoid this additional friction we must come to an agreement in october at the latest so that our new treaty can enter into force on january 1 next year this means that we only a few weeks left and that we should not waste it despite mr barnier saying a deal must be reached by october mr frost believes one could be reached by september the uks chief negotiator said despite all the difficulties on the basis of the work we have done in july my assessment is that agreement can still be reached in september and that we should continue to negotiate with this aim in mind but he added obviously we must prepare for every outcome and it is possible that we wo n't reach agreements he ltold the media that the eu would have to accept the uks right to be an independent state for this to be achieved mr frost said when we began this intensified negotiating process a month or so ago the prime minister set out the principles to commission president ursula von der leyen that were intrinsic to our status and future as an independent state and the eu has heard some of that but it has nt heard all of it and the big underlying difficulty is the fact the eu has nt yet recognised it needs to adapt its position to those principles if were going to reach an agreement he added until the eu has internalised and accepted that we will be an independent state with the right to determine our laws control our own fishing grounds then it will be difficult to reach an agreement how will brexit affect your travel plans to europe next year government announces 700 m for britain eu border we are all in the same storm we are not all in the same boat the government has made borderline heroic efforts to protect the income of those affected by the lockdown of parts of the economy in the darkest of times the coronavirus job retention scheme cjrs and the self employment income support scheme seiss has been the difference between hope and despair but in some cases money has reached those who did nt need it and in some cases it has failed to reach those who did not a good enough excuse to say its too difficult to help people labour say the treasury select committee estimates around one million people slipped between the cracks of the various emergency schemes that s a very significant minority last month mps urged the chancellor to find ways of extending financial help retrospectively rushi sunak had another think and decided that he ca nt to extend the cut off date for the cjrs beyond march 19 is impossible due to the practical implications of monitoring such an extension doing so would significantly increase the risk of abuse joel hills explains government help which has been provided during the lockdown to allow the newly self employed to submit accounts for 2019/20 and thereby qualify for cash seiss grants of up to 2,500 a month creates an opportunity for an individual or an organised criminal gang to file fake or misleading returns to allow those earning more than 50,000 a year to qualify for seiss grants would not be right the treasury repeats its view that 95 % of the self employed fall within that qualification threshold it claims that the average total income of those who do nt was 200,000 last year to allow directors of limited companies who take their wages in the form of dividends to qualify for seiss runs a high risk that incorrect or fraudulent payments could not be recovered ultimately at a cost to the taxpayer one million excluded from government 's income support schemes figures show and do it goes on the chancellor rejects all of the recommended changes mps made last month he points out that between them cjrs and seiss have supported 9.4 million jobs and 2.7 million self employed people he has done what he can it is time to move on now we have to look forward sunak told the treasury select committee last week there would nt now be the opportunity or intention to introduce new schemes the decisions that we made were difficult but they were decisions that we made that i think were the right ones and our focus now is on planning for the recovery protecting jobs family explains impact of missing out on government 's coronavirus support schemes the governments income support schemes had to be scrambled together and deployed in haste there were bound to be design flaws rough justice was inevitable but there are blatant unfairnesses and its easy to see why they stick in the throat of those who find themselves excluded as mps point out a household with two furloughed workers with a combined income of 100,000 a year and savings of 500,000 have received 5,000 a month from the taxpayer a self employed earner on 50,500 received nothing the chancellor wants to move on this issue wo nt go away for those who have struggled for four months without taxpayer support the injustice burns too brightly video report by itv news scotland correspondent peter smith boris johnson has said britain 's response to the coronavirus pandemic has proven the merit of the uk upon a visit to scotland aimed at promoting the united kingdom the prime minister who says the covid-19 crisis has proven the sheer might of the uk is meeting local businesses to reaffirm his commitment to supporting all parts of the british isles in orkney the prime minister said the covid-19 pandemic has shown the merits of the union are very very strong but ahead of the visit to orkney a small group of masked protesters held signs with slogans including hands off scotland one nationalist protester told itv news he believes the pm made this desperate dash up to scotland come all the way up here to orkney because the polls have been showing a yes to leaving the uk lead boris johnson 's might of the union message aimed at wales as well as scotland rightly or wrongly he 's decided that he needs to come up here and save the union but i think the union has been seen as fairly dysfunctional through the whole coronavirus crisis he added there 's a certain difference between scotland wales northern ireland and england in terms of the way that this has been handled and in terms of the way that the leaderships of each country has been perceived the protester named robert leslie says nicola sturgeon has very positive approval ratings compared to mr johnson who has been wallowing in some kind of minus figure nearly as bad as donald trump mr johnson disagreed saying the merits of the union have been proved throughout this crisis adding how he made his journey to orkney to show how we can not just deal with the health crisis but work to deal with the economic consequences together he denied he was suggesting scotland could not handle a pandemic alone but rubbished the idea of holding a fresh independence referendum he said we had a referendum on breaking up the union a few years ago i think only six years ago that is not a generation by any computation and i think what people really want to do is see our whole country coming back strongly together and that s what were going to do labour leader sir keir starmer said mr johnson needs to listen not lecture scots during his visit but he agreed we should n't be pulling apart the uk mr johnson scotland visit comes one day before the one year anniversary of his first day as pm on friday he will say that being part of the uk saved 900,000 scottish jobs during the pandemic according to the bbc which reported inverness mp drew hendry of the snp as saying scotland could flourish as an independent country downing street said that during his visit his first to scotland since the general election in december the prime minister will meet with businesses hit by the pandemic those working in green energy and military personnel to thank them for their efforts in the response to coronavirus there are no plans to meet first minister nicola sturgeon who said at her regular coronavirus briefing on wednesday that she would be willing to meet with the prime minister coronavirus uk 's failure to plan for pandemic was astonishing mps say ms sturgeon said she welcomes boris johnson 's visit claiming it highlights how the scottish people are being taken down a path we have n't chosen mr johnson has pledged 50 million for orkney shetland and the western isles to develop the economy of the islands as part of a growth deal the scottish government said it will invest the same amount in the islands meaning every area in scotland will now receive funding from the joint uk and scottish government initiatives ahead of the visit the prime minister said when i stood on the steps of downing street one year ago i pledged to be a prime minister for every corner of the united kingdom whether you are from east kilbride or dumfries motherwell or paisley i promised to level up across britain and close the opportunity gap the last six months have shown exactly why the historic and heartfelt bond that ties the four nations of our country together is so important and the sheer might of our union has been proven once again the prime minister 's visit comes after a surge in support for scottish independence in recent months according to polls with two panelbase surveys reporting 54 % of respondents would like to see scotland split from the uk the same polls predicted the snp will win a majority of seats in the scottish parliament at next year 's election then prime minister david cameron agreed to stage the independence vote in 2014 after the snp won a majority at holyrood in the 2011 election however mr johnson has repeatedly ruled out another referendum ahead of thursday 's visit the prime minister praised the work of the armed forces in running mobile coronavirus testing centres in scotland and providing air transfers support he added the uk treasury stepped in to save the jobs of a third of scotland 's entire workforce and kept the wolves at bay for tens of thousands of scottish businesses more than ever this shows what we can achieve when we stand together as one united kingdom ministers urged to end face coverings confusion as deadline looms scotland 's first minister nicola sturgeon tweeted i welcome the pm to scotland today one of the key arguments for independence is the ability of scotland to take our own decisions rather than having our future decided by politicians we did n't vote for taking us down a path we have n't chosen his presence highlights that snp westminster leader ian blackford said he did not think boris johnson 's message about scotland 's dependence on the union during coronavirus would be well received during his visit speaking to bbc radio 4 's today programme he said i think he 's going to find that this message is going to go down particularly badly in scotland is he really saying that any other small nation in europe and any other part of the world does n't have the capability to deal with the covid crisis i think the days of telling scotland that we are either too wee too poor or too stupid really is over i think what we 've demonstrated over the past two months in the areas of devolved responsibility and of public health is that the leadership that has been shown by our first minister nicola sturgeon is in sharp contrast with the bluster we have seen from boris johnson no concrete evidence of how russia meddled in scottish independence vote china has threatened to stop recognising british national overseas bno passports in response to the uks visa offer for hong kong residents after chinas controversial security law was enforced in hong kong last month the british government created a new route for those with bno status to live and work in the uk its a move that could potentially extend to nearly three million people offering each the right to apply for citizenship as tensions mount between china and the uk which barred chinese firm huawei from its 5 g network earlier this month china 's foreign ministry spokesman wang wenbin warned of further measures the british side in disregard of china 's solemn representations insisted on political manipulation on the british national overseas passport bno passports he said at a news conference blatantly violated its commitments violated international law and basic norms of international relations and interfered in hong kong affairs and china 's internal affairs we firmly oppose this since the british side violated its commitment first china will consider stopping recognising the bno passports as a valid travel document and reserves the right to take further measures this week foreign secretary dominic raab announced the government has suspended its extradition treaty with hong kong immediately and indefinitely the move was in response to grave concerns over alleged human rights abuses associated with china 's new national security law mr raab said labours shadow foreign secretary lisa nandy said she wanted to see mr raab standing up for bno passport holders and called for her opposite number to summon the chinese ambassador over the comments she said the government must not waver in its commitment to hong kong and the millions potentially at risk of being targeted by new national security legislation unlike the foreign secretary who says there is little the uk can do labour wants to see the government standing up for bno passport holders in hong kong and demanding a guarantee from china that their travel not be restricted on illegitimate grounds the foreign secretary must summon the chinese ambassador without delay to reiterate the uks commitment to the people of hong kong and demand assurances that the validity of british passports will be upheld a spokesman for the chinese embassy in london said in a statement beijing had expressed its concerns over the uk interfering in hong kong matters which are internal affairs of china the controversial security legislation passed last month is aimed at curbing subversive secessionist and terrorist activities as well as foreign intervention in the citys affairs human rights groups warned the law could target opposition politicians seen as insufficiently loyal to beijing for arrest or disqualification from running in september elections for the legislative council it follows months of anti - government protests that at times descended into violence in hong kong last year china uk

democratic process russia report six key findings from intelligence and security committee he added that the tory party are different to labour in that they do nt get the big union payouts insisting we raise money from people by showing were going to do good things for the country i have to say ill go further i m really proud that more and more british citizens not just voted for us in december

passports two members of the isc tory mps theresa villiers and mark pritchard were flagged as having received donations to their constituency branches from mrs chernukhin and mr temerko the report

question about the russia report in the commons on wednesday labour former minister chris bryant accused the government of continuing to hand out golden visas to dodgy russian oligarchs he said what mystifies me is that government ministers are still giving out golden visas to dodgy russian oligarchs that government ministers are still granting exemptions to dodgy russian oligarchs so that they can hide their ownership of businesses in this country and i am mystified that government ministers are still taking millions of pounds from dodgy russian oligarchs we have to clean up our act and it has to start with the government pmqs starmer accuses johnson of leaving serious gap in uk defences by sitting on russia report for 10 months video report by itv news correspondent neil connery the uk and us have agreed to amend the anomaly that allowed harry dunns alleged killer anne sacoolas to claim diplomatic immunity the foreign secretary has said in a written statement despite the anomaly being amended in the immunity agreements surrounding raf croughton the base near where harry dunn died in a road collision ms sacoolas still remains in the us charlotte charles told itv news it means she can go into harry 's anniversary with a slight smile knowing it can not happen to another family again we know harry would be really proud the fact we 've looked after and safeguarded the community around us and the countryside he so loved she said but ms charles added the number one aim of getting ms sacoolas back to the uk has not been achieved and they have a long way to go but they have now have renewed energy to continue the campaign if anything it gives us more momentum because we have achieved one of the largest goals of our campaign so it does give you renewed energy and it does give you renewed hope that we can continue to do as much hard work as we have already done she said the family spokesperson radd seiger told itv news this is only a step only the way the second limb of our campaign is now ticked this will never happen again to another family and we owe that to tim and charlotte although mr seiger added their campaign will not stop until ms sacoolas is back in the uk in his written statement foreign secretary dominic raab said first and foremost the us waiver of immunity from criminal jurisdiction is now expressly extended to the family members of us staff at the croughton annex thus ending the anomaly in the previous arrangements and permitting the criminal prosecution of the family members of those staff should these tragic circumstances ever arise again neil connery explains the significance of the decision we have the deepest sympathy for harry dunns family no family should have to experience what they have gone through and i recognise that these changes will not bring harry back however i hope that the knowledge that the croughton arrangements have been revised and that a family in their position would now see justice done brings some small measure of comfort charlotte charles speaking ahead of wednesday 's announcement and before us secretary of state mike pompeo visited the uk harry dunn 's mother calls on uk to stand up to us dominic raab unaware of harry dunn case until suspect anne sacoolas left uk giving his thoughts on the announcement surrounding the immunity agreements at raf croughton mr raab added its important that we have now agreed with the us new arrangements that have closed the anomaly that led to the denial of justice in the heart breaking case of harry dunn the new arrangements mean it could not happen again he said i know these changes wo nt bring harry back and i appreciate the pain and suffering the family are still going through but i hope this may bring some small measure of comfort to them because i know they want to prevent any other family going through the same ordeal they have in a statement released after the announcement northamptonshire police said it welcomed the changes while we understand these changes will not be retrospective northamptonshire police welcomes these changes northamptonshire police remains committed to working with colleagues in the crown prosecution

immunities pertaining to the staff of the embassy office in croughton and their family members for acts performed outside the course of official duties that occur on or after july 20 2020 this

dangerous some care bosses have told itv news despite the government giving it the green light in england the response comes after some care home residents in england were told they would be allowed to see their loved ones in the flesh for the first time in months after the coronavirus pandemic put a stop to in person visits itv news has spoken to managers at a number of care homes who believe the measure is premature mr johnson has previously felt the ire of those in the care sector after laying the blame for the spread of coronavirus at their door one care home boss told itv news well that is not going to happen here if that man boris johnson thinks he is going to blame us then put us back at risk mate do n't even get me started visits will resume in specific care homes once local

only opening facilities where social distancing can be observed and visitors will be asked to wear face coverings itv news political correspondent paul brand discusses the family reunions and why some care homes have decided against them local directors of public health will be expected to take a measured risk assessed approach considering the situation in specific care homes as well as the community context including any local outbreaks many within the sector are worried permitting outsiders into care homes could result in infections of its residents government have been ignorant blind and reckless in their guidance so quite frankly we are going to continue to do what we feel is best if we followed too little too late guidance we would have lost far more residents wellburn care homes told itv news some care home visits were already permitted but the government says new guidance will allow more to take place safely if a care home is covid secure they will be allowed to arrange visits based on guidance aimed at limiting further outbreaks and protecting staff and residents health secretary matt hancock said visits could be allowed with the rate of community transmission of coronavirus having fallen i know how painful it has been for those in care homes not being able to receive visits from their loved ones throughout this period mr hancock said we are now able to carefully and safely allow visits to care homes which will be based on local knowledge and circumstances for each care home it is really important that we do nt undo all of the hard work of care homes over the last few months while ensuring families and friends can be safely reunited so we have put in place guidance that protects everyone thousands more may have died with coronavirus without being diagnosed data reveals witness the first family reunions in care homes with socially distanced solution the dhsc said care home providers should encourage all visitors to wear a face covering and to wash their hands thoroughly before and after putting it on and taking it off it added visitors should wear appropriate further ppe depending on the need of their visit including gloves and aprons millions have become carers due to coronavirus crisis new research finds care home residents should only be allowed one visitor at a time the department said and it encouraged visits to take place outdoors where possible it said homes should support nhs test and trace by keeping a temporary record including address and phone number of current and previous residents staff and visitors as well as keeping track of visitor numbers and staff it is thought most care homes will still heavily restrict visits in order to avoid infection it is estimated that over 20,000 care home residents have died with coronavirus in the uk and the government has been criticised for not protecting the care sector from infection the government maintains it did everything it could to look after the vulnerable but critics say it was slow to provide adequate testing and ppe to staff and residents care homes in scotland that are free from covid have been able to accept visitors since july 3 while a

heavily delayed russia report which provided a damning assessment of the government and boris johnson at prime minister 's questions labour leader sir keir starmer repeatedly asked the prime minister why he sat on this report for 10 months and failed to plug a gap in our law and national security for a year and a half his comments follow those of the intelligence and security committee which in october last year sent the damning russia report to the pm and concluded that moscow poses a threat to britain with the uk being considered one of its biggest targets the prime minister received that report ten months ago given that the threat is described as immediate and urgent why on earth did the pm sit on that report for so long sir keir asked responding to sir keir mr johnson told the commons when he was foreign secretary he took the strongest possible action against russia during pmqs he added the right honourable gentleman opposite sir keir starmer sat on his hands and said nothing while the labour party parroted the line of the kremlin when people in this country were poisoned at the orders of vladimir putin labour leader said he was absolutely clear in condemning russian aggression in salisbury adding he was previously involved in bringing proceedings against russia on behalf of the family of poisoning victim alexander litvinenko he attacked mr johnson for underestimating the threat from russia telling mps the governments taken its eye off the ball arguably it was nt even on the pitch he went on to ask about delays in bringing forward new security legislation to which boris johnson insisted new laws are coming in connection with espionage theft of intellectual property and sanctions limiting russian interference in uk will be difficult says journalist catherine belton the prime minister said sir keir 's questions were absolutely absurd and claimed the uk is the world 's most vigilant country when it comes to protecting against the threat from russia mr johnson said the government was bringing forward several pieces of legislation to tackle the russian threat and claimed sir keir 's arguments were rooted in his dislike of brexit he said this is about pressure from the islingtonian remainers who ve seized on this report to try to give the impression that russia interference was some how responsible for brexit the russia report explained uk government talks tough on russia but report highlights failure to act shapps seeks to discredit russia report as it was written by a remainer the simple fact is that after campaigning for remain after wanting to overturn the peoples referendum day in day out all the period when he was sitting on the labour front bench simply ca nt bring himself to accept that the prime minister added sir keir starmer accused the prime minister of reading pre - prepared answers rather than addressing national security concerns he pressed for action against kremlin backed disinformation and suggested the pm should look again at the licensing for broadcaster rt formerly russia today to operate in the uk mr johnson said sir keir should have called out labour former leader jeremy corbyn when he took money for appearing on russia today adding the leader of the opposition has more flip flops than bournemouth beach sir keir responded criticising the pm 's prepared gags on flip flops and made reference to reports that former journalist mr johnson wrote two articles ahead of outlining his stance on brexit before the referendum one supporting remain and the other backing leave this is the former columnist who wrote two versions of every article ever published sir keir added in what itv news political correspondent daniel hewitt described as a significant moment sir keir responded to the pm 's comment about the former labour leader appearing on russia today in case the pm has nt noticed the labour party is under new management he said and no front bencher of this party has appeared on rt since i ve been leading this party this session of pmqs was the last before parliament breaks for summer recess before returning at the start of september watch pmqs in full video

on the potential threat posed by russia it is understood prime minister boris johnson will strengthen counter - espionage laws in the wake of the bombshell study by the commons intelligence and security committee isc ministers are considering a us style law requiring people working on behalf of foreign states to formally register their activities the move comes with labour poised to go on the offensive on the issue on wednesday at prime minister 's questions parliament 's final sitting day before the summer recess russia report government underestimated threat and clearly let us down by not probing brexit meddling from brexit to bots six points from the report into russian interference transport secretary grant shapps confirmed the government was looking at introducing new legislation to tackle the activities of hostile states we want to be able to look at the activities clamp down on the activities of hostile states which threaten the uk he told bbc radio 4s today the government has already committed to introduce legislation to provide the security services and law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to disrupt hostile action he told sky news we are looking at additional powers to look at the activities of hostile states and that may include introducing new laws adding that the uk was working with like minded international partners on something like the foreign agent registration laws that exist for example in the us and australia the us foreign agents registration act covers activities including lobbying and public relations for overseas states and australia has a similar register labour has accused the government of failing in its response to the security threat posed to uk democracy by russia after the long delayed isc report insisted london was too slow to recognise moscows menace to british democratic processes speaking ahead of an urgent question in parliament on wednesday labours shadow home secretary nick thomas symonds said that on every level the governments response does not appear to be equal to the threat mr johnson is likely to face a grilling on the situation in the last prime ministers questions of the parliamentary session but during wednesday 's morning media rounds the transport secretary denied british intelligence services had taken their eye off the ball over the security threat posed by russia appearing on sky news grant shapps said its obviously right that were always reminded that the threat is there and its very real but i do nt think its the case that the intelligence services took their eye off the ball he also said the report had not contained any evidence of russian interference in the eu referendum in 2016 the report did nt reveal that mr shapps said and suggested there was no need for a big sudden review into potential russian involvement shadow home secretary mr thomas symonds said the intelligence and security committees report on russia exposes deep systemic failings in government approach to security this report outlines the scale of the shortcomings of the governments response to maintaining our national security in the face of what is clearly a growing and significant threat from russia he continued the report outlines a litany of hostile state activity from cyber warfare interfering in democratic processes acts of violence on uk soil and illicit finance uk government may talk tough on russia but report highlights failure to act on moscow aggression on every level the governments response does not appear to be equal to the threat while on key issues it is clear that there is no overall strategic response to this challenge little wonder the government have been so keen to delay the publication the uk has world leading security services yet this report makes clear they have not received the strategic support the legislative tools or the resources necessary to defend our interests the government need to urgently outline how they will address these systemic failings the russia report explained it has been suggested the uk could introduce a register of foreign agents like the ones in place in the us and australia as part of a stronger move against foreign interference in internal affairs under the american system people who work for foreign governments and officials have to register with us justice department and file reports about their activities in an explosive commentary the isc said the government was slow to recognise the potential threat posed by russia to british democratic processes and did not properly consider whether moscow could interfere in the brexit referendum until after the event the isc report concluded the uk only belatedly realised the threat to political processes despite alarm bells ringing over the 2014 scottish referendum the intelligence agencies and government departments treated the issue as a hot potato with nobody effectively tackling the problem the committee said the government said there was no evidence of successful russian interference in the brexit vote but the committee which oversees the work of britains spies suggested there was no proper investigation mi5 provided just six lines of text when asked whether there was secret intelligence on the issue of potential russian meddling in the referendum but the government led by a prominent brexiteer in mr johnson has rejected the committees call for a full analysis of whether vladimir putins government did attempt to influence the result of the 2016 vote the report was drafted by the iscs members in

parliamentary worker in her early 20s twice in 2016 elphicke admitted to police in 2018 that he had an affair with a third woman not a complainant in this trial but distanced himself from the parliamentary worker he said he kissed the first complainant under misapprehension but denies sexual assault however entering the witness box at southwark crown court this week elphicke told jurors he had lied to police about his true feelings for the parliamentary worker saying he was besotted with her and lost his head he said he did not tell police about propositioning her because he was concerned mrs elphicke would wrongly think he was having an affair and that it would effectively be the final straw for their marriage elphicke told jurors it was only when his wife who is not a witness in the case was going over text messages between her husband and the young woman during lockdown that she accused him of having an affair partly due to kisses on text messages and a reference to cat cuddles he said ms marshall described it as a pack of lies citing only three kisses in more than 1,000 texts between them she told the 49-year old father of two it was only when you and wife went under lockdown you realised the lies you had told about the parliamentary worker could be disproved you re boxed into a corner and you ve got no other choice its not the first and second complainant who ve lied its you who s lied elphicke said no i did nt i did nt sexually assault either woman the prosecutor said you sexually assaulted both of them in the way they have described did nt you elphicke replied no elphicke denied under re examination from defence counsel ian winter qc any suggestion he and his wife had conspired over the case he added i got myself into a situation i dug myself into a hole it was only when we had it out an argument after she went through the evidence that i was able to sort this whole mess out for good mr winter asked have you looked the jury in the eye and lied to them elphicke replied i ve not lied to them mr winter asked is there any truth in the allegation that you have sexually assaulted these women elphicke replied no the prosecutor also accused elphicke of using his friend former attorney general dominic grieve to protect him when summoned to speak to senior party figures about the allegations without telling mr grieve he had propositioned the parliamentary worker ms marshall said you hid behind the former attorney general having lied to him about what happened with the woman elphicke replied i did not lie to him elphicke denies three counts of sexual assault the trial was adjourned until thursday the 11 jurors were told they would likely be sent to consider their deliberations early next week former labour party leader jeremy corbyn is facing legal action after commenting on a substantial damages settlement agreed between his party and seven anti - semitism whistleblowers who spoke to bbc panorama for an investigation last year the labour party settled with the whistleblowers over defamatory and false allegations made following a the investigation into anti - semitism former leader jeremy corbyn however said the move to pay the whistleblowers was a political decision not a legal one and described the result as disappointing in a statement posted on facebook mr corbyn said the settlement risks giving credibility to misleading and inaccurate allegations but it appears the comments could have landed the 71-year old socialist in hot water with a lawyer who represents the whistleblowers and the programme 's reporter john ware saying he has been instructed to sue mr corbyn when asked if action would be taken arising from mr corbyns statement lawyer mark lewis from patron law said i can confirm that i have been instructed to pursue cases labour was being sued by mr ware and the whistleblowers over a press release that was issued before the panorama programme aired which the party now admits contained defamatory and false allegations about john ware after the settlement the party released a statement we would like to take this opportunity to withdraw these allegations we would like to apologise unreservedly for the distress embarrassment and hurt caused by their publication as we acknowledge in the statement in open court john ware is a very experienced broadcast and print journalist producer and author and we have agreed to pay damages to him the party said they issued an unreserved apology to mr ware and whistleblowers kat buckingham michael creighton samuel matthews dan hogan louise withers green benjamin westerman and martha robinson we unreservedly withdraw all allegations of bad faith malice and lying we would like to apologise unreservedly for the distress embarrassment and hurt caused by their publication the party added the apology appears to be another attempt by new leader sir keir starmer to distance himself from the former leadership at pmqs on wednesday he told boris johnson the labour party is under new management and at the end of june he sacked one of mr corbyn 's closest allies rebecca long bailey from the frontbench labour is committed to tackling anti - semitism within their ranks labour said under the leadership of keir starmer and angela rayner mr corbyn said the party members have a right to accountability and transparency of decisions taken in their name and an effective commitment from the party to combat antisemitism and racism in all their forms but he added our legal advice was that the party had a strong defence and the evidence in the leaked labour report that is now the subject of an nec inquiry led by martin forde qc strengthened concerns about the role played by some of those who took part in the programme the decision to settle these claims in this way is disappointing and risks giving credibility to misleading and inaccurate allegations about action taken to tackle antisemitism in the labour party in recent years to give our members the answers and justice they deserve the inquiry led by martin forde must now fully address the evidence the internal report uncovered of racism sexism factionalism and obstruction of labours 2017 general election campaign labour and jeremy corbyn condemned after heartbreaking bbc panorama documentary on anti - semitism the bbc said the bbc will always support fair and impartial reporting exposing wrongdoing and holding power to account the panorama programme did precisely that but was subject to an extraordinary and vitriolic attack by the labour party we welcome todays long overdue apology to john ware and the seven panorama whistleblowers who have been subjected to painful and damaging personal attacks on their integrity and character we applaud their strength to take this case forward and are pleased it has been recognised in court that these extremely serious and damaging allegations against them were false and have been unreservedly withdrawn john ware is a reporter with an extraordinary record of excellence at panorama for investigative journalism in the public interest labour 's new general secretary will help restore trust with voters says keir starmer senior cabinet minister grants shapps has sought to discredit some aspects of the russia report because it was written by an ardent remainer with specific views on the outcome of the brexit referendum the long awaited russia report which was delayed for several months condemned the government on numerous fronts regarding the threat of interference but the most damning criticism was that the government had let down the public by actively avoiding an investigation into meddling in the eu referendum in 2016 the intelligence and security committee isc the body which wrote the report said there was credible evidence showing russia had attempted to interfere in the scottish independence referendum in 2014 but said there was no evidence of meddling in the brexit vote because no one in government sought to look or ask the question that needed to be asked many on the leave side said the lack of evidence proved the vote was won legitimately but remainers including alastair campbell have said it proves brexit is a fraud transport secretary shapps has attempted to rubbish the claims of remainers saying let 's not forget this report was written in a specific context by not the current chair of the intelligence and security committee but by former chair dominic grieve russia report government underestimated threat and clearly let us down by not probing brexit meddling new powers promised to help uk spies tackle hostile states in wake of damning russia report mr grieve who quit the tory party last year over brexit was one of the remain side 's most passionate supporters in parliament and mr shapps appeared to suggest his pro - eu stance made him biased mr shapps says mr grieve had some what in the end turned out to be quite i do n't want to use the word extreme in the wrong way but specific views about all manor of issues including the outcome of the 2016 eu referendum when you read the report you can see it 's been written in that context he said mr shapps denied the isc allegation that the government had been ignoring the russian threat not for one moment he said where action needs to be taken it is taken he said our intelligence and security agencies are amongst if not the best in the world and they have not taken their eye off the ball he admitted there is more though that we can always and should always be doing as a country he said the government welcomes the report 's publication and is looking at powers that can be used to help as the nature and shape of this threat changes to challenge what 's been happening with russia and others it is understoodprime minister boris johnsonwill strengthen counter - espionage laws in the wake of the bombshell study by the commons intelligence and security committee isc ministers are considering a us style law requiring people working on behalf of foreign states to formally register their activities the move comes with labour poised to go on the offensive on the issue on wednesday at prime minister 's questions parliament 's final sitting day before the summer recess mr shapps confirmed the government was looking at introducing new legislation to tackle the activities of hostile states we want to be able to look at the activities clamp down on the activities of hostile states which threaten the uk he told bbc radio 4s today the government has already committed to introduce legislation to provide the security services and law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to disrupt hostile action video report by itv news political correspondent paul brand successive governments failed to tackle threats to british democracy after a long awaited report into russian interference found the uk is considered one of moscow 's top western intelligence targets the russia report has shown there were attempts to influence the scottish independence referendum in 2014 but the intelligence and security committee isc said the government actively avoided investigating interference in the brexit referendum in 2016 isc member and labour mp kevan jones said no evidence of meddling in that vote was found because no one in government sought to look or ask the question that needed to be asked as such the committee said interference in the brexit referendum could not be ruled out main points from the report russia considers the uk one of its top western intelligence targets there is credible evidence suggesting that russia undertook influence campaigns in relation to the scottish independence referendum in 2014 it is impossible to assess allegations that russia sought to influence the 2016 brexit referendum the government took its eye off the ball and failed to respond to the threat from moscow social media companies must take action and remove covert hostile state material successive governments whether under david cameron theresa may or boris johnson are heavily criticised in the report with the isc accusing ministers of taking their eye off the ball regarding the threat of russian interference instead choosing to prioritise counter - terrorism from brexit to bots six points from the report into russian interference the committee said the government has clearly let us down because it should have attempted to mitigate interference in the brexit referendum after evidence showed russia tried to meddle in the scottish referendum what is the russia report and why was it commissioned the isc said there has been credible open source commentary suggesting that russia undertook influence campaigns in relation to the scottish independence referendum in 2014 it added it appears that redacted what some commentators have described as potentially the first post - soviet russian interference in a western democratic process the committee said the government badly underestimated the russian threat and was now playing catch up in investigating the country an allegation swiftly denied by the government level of russian meddling in british democracy unknown says political correspondent paul brand no one in government wanted to touch the issue of russian interference in the brexit referendum with a 10-foot pole said committee member and snp mp stewart hosie speaking about the probe into alleged russian interference in british democracy mr hosie said no one in government knew if russia interfered or sought to influence the 2016 referendum because they did not want to know the report into russian meddling which the committee said was unnecessarily delayed by many months found the country poses an all encompassing security threat to the uk fuelled by paranoia about the west russia carries out malicious cyber activity in order to assert itself aggressively for example by attempting to interfere in other countries elections mr hosie said he added we know that russia targets the uk following the report 's release a spokesperson for boris johnson said the prime minister is absolutely confident the 2016 european union referendum result was fair we have seen no evidence of successful interference in the eu referendum the spokesperson said as he confirmed the government would not order an investigation of russian activities around the vote our intelligence and security agencies produce regular assessments of the threat posed by hostile state activities including any potential interference in past or current uk democratic processes unprecedented delays and dislocation before publication the report said russian influence in the uk is the new normal but criticised successive governments for welcoming oligarchs and their money with open arms the report was delayed several times and was eventually released many months after it was finished a complete version was sent to boris johnson on october 17 before the 2019 general election but its release was delayed in order to prepare for the poll video report by itv news security editor rohit kachroo the committee said the public should have had sight of the report before the election dominic grieve a former chair of the isc said the delay in publishing this report i ve always considered to be inexplicable and the public were entitled to have this information at the end of october and the government has given no credible explanation as to why they did nt have it the report was again delayed after the election with it taking several months to reform the isc mr jones said claims by the prime minister that it required six weeks to get his confirmation for the report were categorically not true the committee had been subjected to unprecedented delay and dislocation its chair julian lewis said he told journalists on tuesday this really must never happen again and the sooner normal relations are restored between this committee and the government the better it will be for all concerned that prospect has not been helped by the government refusing to tell us what was in the written ministerial statement about this russian report which the government chose to table at the commons at 10.30 this morning to clash with the start of this event commenting on the delay in the release of the isc russia report mr hosie said the impact is that any lessons which could have been learned will now be learned rather later than they ought to have been perhaps too late to stop some other cyber attacks the report comes just days afterforeign secretary dominic raab said it was almost certain russia had tried to interfere in the 2019 election the intelligence and security committee said russias cyber capability when combined with its willingness to deploy it in a malicious capacity is a matter of grave concern and poses an immediate and urgent threat to our national security its report said gchq had advised that russian actors had orchestrated phishing attempts against government departments including against the foreign office and the defence science and technology laboratory dstl during the early stages of the investigation into the salisbury attacks in 2018 time to name and shame the intelligence and security committee isc recommended that the government name and shame russia when it is found to be behind hacking or other cyber attack attempts it also said ministers should engage in diplomacy to ensure allies do the same its report said when attacks can be traced back and we accept that this is in itself resource intensive the government must always consider naming and shaming the government rejected the suggestion it had badly underestimated the russian threat the government has long recognised there is an enduring and significant threat posed by russia to the uk and its allies including conventional military capabilities disinformation illicit finance influence operations and cyber attacks the official response to the report said as such russia remains a top national security priority for the government what does the government say in response in a 20-page response to the report the government rejected the call for an assessment of alleged russian activity during the brexit referendum it said we have seen no evidence of successful interference in the eu referendum it added we keep such assessments under review and where necessary update them in response to new intelligence including during democratic events such as elections and referendums where new information emerges the government will always consider the most appropriate use of any intelligence it develops or receives including whether it is appropriate to make this public given this long standing approach a retrospective assessment of the eu referendum is not necessary the russian response the kremlin denies any attempt to influence foreign democracies with russiasambassador to the uk andrei kelin saying the country would work with the british government whether labour or the conservatives were reading it he told itv news political correspondent paul brand that russian people may have attempted to interfere in the uk democracy but he denied it being sponsored by the russian state on the official level i can categorically deny interferences in the british democracy we have no interest in interference he said he added russia is big and russians are living everywhere some of them are well of course there is a group of hackers but this officially linking them with russian government it will be nonsense the russian government does not do anything like that mr kelin quoted shakespeare when commenting on the report saying its much ado about nothing or it amounted to not very much it provided a lot of noise in the press but it does not contain any facts which may be of interest for us russia 's director of the information and press department of the ministry of foreign affairs maria zakharova told itv news the report is empty and said there is nothing more to add the report 's release comes at a time of strained relations between britain and russia there are allegation that russian intelligence linked hackers tried to steal details of research into coronavirus vaccines this comes on top of the salisbury novichok poisoning in 2018 which left former double agent sergei skripal and his daughter yulia in hospital and led to the death of dawn sturgess watch the russia report press conference in full read the full russia report here russian hackers

thing in its decision to ban new huawei products from the uk 's 5 g network infrastructure from december 31 this year the us secretary of state has said mike pompeo welcomed the uks response over china as he condemned beijings actions on a visit to london as foreign secretary dominic raab denied the government had been pushed into a tougher position by the us into its china position the secretary of state said the government 's u - turn on allowing the chinese tech giant to play a role in the uks 5 g network was a sovereign decision made in the best interests of people of the united kingdom and not because the united states said it was ok mr pompeo held talks with senior backbench tories including leading china hawk sir iain duncan smith before his meetings with ministers but mr raab insisted i do nt think there is any question of strong arming mike and i always have constructive discussions at a brief press conference in lancaster house following talks with mr raab mr pompeo said we have seen hong kongs freedoms crushed and watched the ccp chinese communist party bully its neighbours i want to take this opportunity to congratulate the british government for its principled response to these challenges those measures included banning huawei allowing british national overseas passport holders to come to the uk suspending the extradition treaty and extending an arms embargo on china to cover hong kong mr pompeo said we support those sovereign choices we think well done the us secretary of state accused china of being disgraceful over covid he claimed the ccp chinese communist party had exported the virus to further their own aims and said he wanted countries including the uk to form a coalition to persuade china to change course mr pompeo also attacked china over its foreign policy stance you ca nt go make claims for maritime regions that you have no lawful claim to he said you ca nt threaten countries and bully them in the himalayas you ca nt engage in cover ups and co - opt international institutions like the world health organization he said last month 20 indiansoldiers including a commanding officer were killed in a violent face off withchinesesoldiers in the himalayan region of ladakh an area china has claimed sovereignty over mr pompeo also highlighted the ccp directing state owned firms to steal intellectual property from us firms the news conference followed candid talks with mr johnson in the rose garden of no.10 downing street said mr johnson and mr pompeo along with the foreign secretary had discussed shared global security and foreign policy issues including chinas actions in hong kong and xinjiang where there are concerns about the abuse of the uighur muslims they also discussed the importance of the five eyes alliance the us uk canada australia and new zealand taking an ambitious approach to working together on the technologies of the future something apparently aimed at ending the reliance on chinese technology from firms such as huawei downing street said they also discussed a possible us uk trade deal mr pompeo said it was a constructive visit and our two countries long standing strong bilateral relationship has laid the foundation for the candid discussion on issues ranging from 5 g telecommunication to our negotiations for a us uk free trade agreement however china has warned britain will bear the consequences of its actions over huawei a spokesperson for the chinese embassy in london said in a statement beijing had expressed its concerns over the uk interfering in hong kong matters which are internal affairs of china downing street rejected chinas condemnation of the uks actions over the extradition treaty and the extension of an arms embargo to cover hong kong it was a reasonable and proportionate response to chinas failure to live up to its international obligations with respect to hong kong the prime ministers official spokesperson said a spokesperson for the chinese embassy said now the uk side has gone even further down the wrong road in disregard of chinas solemn position and repeated representations it once again contravened international law and the basic norms governing international relations and blatantly interfered in chinas internal affairs in an attempt to disrupt the implementation of the national security law for hong kong sar and undermine the citys prosperity and stability china urges the uk side to immediately stop interfering in hong kong affairs which are chinas internal affairs in any form the uk will bear the consequences if it insists on going down the wrong road russia report uk actively avoided probe into brexit meddling and failed to respond to threatrussia report key questions on the long awaited publication video report by itv news video producer natalia jorquera the russia report was put together by the uk parliament 's intelligence and security committee otherwise known as the isc which oversees the work of mi5 and mi6 in 2018 the committee which is made up of mps and peers from different parties was tasked with examining possible russian interference in uk democracy over recent years relations between the uk and russia have become increasingly difficult because of the uk 's stand against russia 's interventions abroad like its war against georgia in 2008 the annexation of crimea in 2014 but also deaths on uk soil in 2006 alexander litvinenko a former kgb agent who fled to england after criticising russia was assassinated in london but relations reached an all time low after the poisoning of former russian military intelligence officersergei skripal and his daughter yulia insalisburyin 2018 they werepoisonedwith a deadly nerve agent novichok and while they both survived a woman named dawn sturgess died after coming into contact with the chemical leading to the commissioning of the report one of the key points the report says is thatrussia poses an immediate threat to the uk 's national security and that britain is one of russia 's top intelligence targets in the western world not just to steal secrets but to create disunity in the west the report concludes that there is credible evidence suggesting that russia carried out influence campaigns to attempt to discredit the scottish independence referendum in 2014 however despite what many people were expecting from this report the committee could not categorically say whether there was interference in the eu referendum or the 2019 uk general election not because there was no evidence but only because the government did not seek to investigate it the uk government responding to the report rejected the committee 's call to investigate whether there had been any russian interference in the eu referendum saying they have seen no evidence of any successful interference and scotland 's first minister nicola sturgeon says she hasno objection to an inquiry being launched into russian interference in the scottish independence referendum read the full russia report here russian hackers targeting coronavirus vaccine research uk agency warns almost certain russia tried to interfere in uk general election nigel farage is demanding an apology after the long awaited report into russian interference in british democracy concluded no evidence could be found of meddling in the brexit referendum of 2016 but the intelligence and security committee said it could not rule out any attempted interference in that poll because the government actively avoided investigating it the ambiguity has resulted in remainers claiming the uk 's democratic processes were not protected potentially cheating them out of a fair contest but brexiters claim the report vindicates the result since the uk voted to leave the eu many brexit opponents have claimed the result was swayed by russian actors influencing people online following the report 's release many brexit supporters including figurehead mr farage and billionaire backer arron banks took to twitter to call for apologies former ukip leader nigel farage tweeted years of lies and smears from remain politicians and much of our media there is no evidence of russian involvement with leave eu or me in the referendum it was all a hoax apologies are now required mr banks retweeted a comment by his friend and fellow brexit supporter andy wigmore who also asked for an apology there were hundreds of responses to mr farage 's tweet with many questioning whether he had read the report and pointing to lines in it which say the threat was not investigated but the brexit supporting government with a cabinet made up of eurosceptics has also taken the report as proof the referendum was won legitimately did the uk fail to take the threat from russia seriously enough in a response issued immediately after the report was released the government said we have seen no evidence of successful interference in the eu referendum and boris johnson is absolutely confident the 2016 european union referendum result was fair the his official spokesman said we have seen no evidence of successful interference in the eu referendum the spokesman said as he confirmed the government would not order an investigation of russian activities around the vote our intelligence and security agencies produce regular assessments of the threat posed by hostile state activities including any potential interference in past or current uk democratic processes in a 20-page response to the report the government said there was no need to investigate alleged russian activity during the brexit referendum because regular assessments are made by intelligence and security agencies an investigation by the intelligence and security committee found russia did attempt to influence the scottish independence referendum in 2014 but it said it the government did not take action to protect the uks process in 2016 several social media users who previously supported britain remaining in the uk such as former labour spin doctor alastair campbell said the report showed brexit is a fraud he told itv news he 'd always thought that the referendum was a fraud and always felt that it was won on one set of lies and lots of other sets of lies have been practiced since he added they lied systematically and i fear that these three things together brexit johnson a proven liar as prime minister with no real commitment to standards in public life and now this report they are all symbols of a country i 'm afraid that 's chosen its own decline liberal democrat acting leader sir ed davey said the government had been wilfully negligent by not investigating the part russia played in the brexit referendum we need a proper investigation into the full role that russian interference has played in our democracy he said he accused boris johnson of refusing a cross - party call to launch an inquiry because he is worried about what it might find this is a green light for russia to interfere with our democracy in future knowing there will be no consequences he tweeted guy verhofstadt chief brexit negotiator for the european parliament tweeted brexit was always a gift to putin because it weakened the european union & left britain divided isolated the # russiareport shows just how many questions remain unanswered meanwhile scotlands first minister said she has no objection to an inquiry being launched into russian interference in the scottish independence referendum speaking at the scottish governments coronavirus briefing on tuesday hours after the report was published nicola sturgeon said governments should not be complacent about the possibility of interference in democratic processes the report which was due to be published before the 2019 general election but faced months of delays said there is credible open source commentary suggesting russia used influence campaigns during the independence referendum campaign in 2014 ms sturgeon said if there s to be an inquiry into that and i would have no objections to the contrary it is for the uk government to do the first minister said she hopes the report will lead to a much more rigorous approach by the uk government in dealing with interference the 2014 referendum is mentioned in just one passage of the report and in a further two footnotes leading ms sturgeon to question what could be gleaned from the findings she said i do nt think you can draw any conclusions from the three lines or thereabouts that the report has on the scottish independence referendum the first minister added she did not think her values along with those of the snp and the wider independence movement could be further removed from the values that vladimir putin and the russian regime stand for the long awaited russia report was published this morning and has made claims over brexit the scottish independence referendum and social media here are six key findings from the intelligence and security committee isc report russian influence in uk is the new normal with oligarchs welcomed with open arms russias elite and those close to president vladimir putin aided by the uks 1994 investor visa scheme have put money into so many different sectors particularly in london that any government measures against them would be damage limitation said a section in the isc report what is now clear is that it the investor policy was in fact counter - productive in that it offered ideal mechanisms by which illicit finance could be recycled through what has been referred to as the london laundromat said the committee the money was also invested in extending patronage and building influence across a wide sphere of the british establishment pr firms charities political interests academia and cultural institutions were all willing beneficiaries of russian money contributing to a reputation laundering process russian hackers targeting coronavirus vaccine researchers uk agency warns almost certain russia tried to interfere in uk general election says dominic raab in brief russian influence in the uk is the new normal and there are a lot of russians with very close links to putin who are well integrated into the uk business and social scene and accepted because of their wealth this level of integration in londongrad in particular means that any measures now being taken by the government are not preventative but rather constitute damage limitation russia considers the uk one of its top western intelligence targets snp mp stewart hosie a member of the intelligence and security committee said the uk was one of russias top western intelligence targets it weaponises information he told reporters russias intelligence services are disproportionately large and powerful and they can act with little constraint he said did the uk fail to take the threat from russia seriously enough mr hosie added russia poses an all encompassing security threat which is fuelled by paranoia about the west and a desire to be seen as a resurgent great power it carries out malicious cyber activity in order to assert itself aggressively for example by attempting to interfere in other countries elections the report adds witnesses have suggested that we would sit just behind the us and nato in any priority list this is likely to be related to the uks close relationship with the us and the fact that the uk is seen as central to the western anti - russian lobby credible evidence that russia tried to influence scottish independence referendum the isc said there has been credible open source commentary suggesting that russia undertook influence campaigns in relation to the scottish independence referendum in 2014 in censored comments that follow it notes it appears that redacted what some commentators have described as potentially the first post - soviet russian interference in a western democratic process russia report key questions on the long awaited publication more now needs to be done by security services and the intelligence community to assure the public that elections and the democratic process are safe said the isc whilst the issues at stake in the eu referendum campaign are less clear cut it is nonetheless the committees view that the uk intelligence community should produce an analogous assessment of potential russian interference in the eu referendum and that an unclassified summary of it be published the committee stated even if the conclusion of any such assessment were that there was minimal interference this would nonetheless represent a helpful reassurance to the public that the uks democratic processes had remained relatively safe impossible to assess allegations russia sought to influence brexit the isc said it did not seek to assess the impact of russias bids to influence the 2016 brexit vote the report said there have been widespread public allegations that russia sought to influence the 2016 referendum on the uks membership of the eu the impact of any such attempts would be difficult if not impossible to assess and we have not sought to do so however it is important to establish whether a hostile state took deliberate action with the aim of influencing a uk democratic process irrespective of whether it was successful or not the report added with parts redacted open source studies have pointed to the preponderance of pro - brexit or anti - eu stories on rt and sputnik and the use of bots and trolls as evidence of russian attempts to influence the process we have sought to establish whether there is secret intelligence which supported or built on these studies in response to our request for written evidence at the outset of the inquiry mi5 initially provided just six lines of text the brevity was indicative of the extreme caution amongst the intelligence and security agencies at the thought they might have any role in relation to the uks democratic processes and particularly one as contentious as the eu referendum the report added we repeat that this attitude is illogical this is about the protection of the process and mechanism from hostile state interference which should fall to our intelligence and security agencies government took its eye off the ball and failed to respond to moscow threat the 2006 murder of alexander litvinenko demonstrated that russia under president putin had moved from potential partner to established threat the report states it adds if we consider the russian threat to have been clearly indicated in 2006 with the murder of alexander litvinenko and then take events such as the annexation of crimea in 2014 as firmly underlining russian intent on the global stage the question is whether the intelligence community should and could have reacted more quickly and increased operational effort on russia on figures alone it could be said that they took their eye off the ball nevertheless the heads of mi5 sis gchq and defence intelligence all sought to defend against this suggestion social media companies must take action and remove covert hostile state material social media companies were criticised in the 50-page document for failing to tackle the spread of disinformation we note that as with so many other issues currently it is the social media companies which hold the key and yet are failing to play their part said the isc the government must now seek to establish a protocol with the social media companies to ensure that they take covert hostile state use of their platforms seriously and have clear timescales within which they commit to removing such material government should name and shame those which fail to act this matter is in our view urgent and we expect the government to report on progress in this area as soon as possible the report adds the salisbury novichok poisonings one year on how the events unfolded tuesday 's russia report outlines the role of russian media and online bots in britains political debate but we knew all that it describes the influence of russian money and influence including through london lawyers and accountants but we knew that too it highlights the fact there s criticism of the social mediacompaniesand the laws relating to espionage but again that s a familiar assessment the 55-page report is a fascinating read russia report six key findings from intelligence and security committee uk took eye off the ball and failed to respond to threat of russian interference read the full russia report here but those who searched it looking to find out whether moscows intelligence agencies had successfully interfered in important political events like the brexit referendum might have been disappointed identifying that would be extremely difficult anyway instead the report reaches a more damning and immediate conclusion the government was nt really looking closely enough did the uk fail to take the threat from russia seriously enough basically to find a problem you need to take a look in the first place during a time when the threat from islamic state and far right terrorists has grown british intelligence agencies have increased their focus on russian influence yet the issue is still seenas a hot potato the report concludes and ultimately that is the government 's fault rather that the spy agencies according to the committee last week the government talkedtough onrussia after its cyber security chief warned that moscow had tried to hack efforts by universities and pharmaceutical companies to

week'sanalysissuggests the governments actions have yet to catch up with their words almost certain russia tried to interfere in uk general election says dominic raab russia report six key findings from intelligence and security committee the salisbury novichok poisonings one year on how the events unfolded social care providers have accused the government of sidestepping the issue of low pay

crime agency staff members of the judiciary armed forces and senior civil servants no salary increase was announced for nurses and healthcare assistants care associations called for action to replace lip service following a gruelling few months of coronavirus during which frontline care staff have put themselves in harms way the government said nurses and healthcare assistants are covered by a three year pay deal agreed in 2018 more than 300 nhs workers have died in england alone after contracting the deadly virus many doing so while caring for patients it is not known how many carers have died from the respiratory disease the above inflation pay rise announced by the chancellor on tuesday will see almost 900,000 workers benefit with teachers and doctors seeing the largest increase at

employers to finish coronavirus assessments for at risk staff in four weeks why are more bame medics dying than their white colleagues morale in the social care workforce will also be damaged by the announcement with one care provider group calling it the latest kick in the teeth from the government chief executive of care england professor martin green said these past few months have been an incredibly challenging time for our nhs and social care and it is imperative that frontline staff are recognised and rewarded as such we need to ensure that lip service is replaced by action in order to ensure the long term sustainability of the adult social care sector vic rayner executive director at the national care forum which represents 120 of the uks social care charities said it is unacceptable for the government to sidestep the issue around social care workers pay in todays announcement care workers have been a stalwart of the covid front line and need recognition this has never been a low skilled job and should never again be consigned as a low paid role we need the government to act now to ensure that each and every care worker is rewarded for their extraordinary work dame donna kinnair chief executive of the royal college of nursing said it is not acceptable to make nurses wait a year adding in this year of all years it is time to value these professionals and begin to fill the tens of thousands of vacant posts but even for junior doctors the 2 % pay rise will mean the majority have seen their wages fall by between 500 and 850 in comparison to senior colleagues in just two years the hospital consultants and specialists association hcsa union said the hospital doctors union said the announcement will land a damaging psychological blow on englands lowest paid doctors explaining the government 's decision over the pay rises policing minister kit malthouse told itv news nurses are subject to a separate pay deal that was negotiated back in 2018 called agenda for change which has seen significant change in starting salaries and other salaries and i think on average its a 4.4 % pay deal they 're in the middle of that and no doubt the department of health will be talking to them about what happens in the future when the time is appropriate speaking on bbc radio 4 's today programme mr malthouse added social care workers would have to rely on increases in the minimum wage to improve their pay levels mr malthouse said the vast majority of social care workers are paid in the private sector so our ability to influence pay rates there is limited he added apart from nationalising the entire thing the minimum wage rate was the best tool the government had to recognise the efforts of care workers here 's a breakdown of the public sector professions that are getting a pay rise school teachers will get a 3.1 % pay rise doctors and dentists will get a 2.8 % pay rise police officers will get a 2.5 % pay rise armed forces

military will get a 2 % pay rise making the announcement chancellor rishi sunak said these past months have underlined what we always knew that our public sector workers make a vital contribution to our country and that we can rely on them when we need them its right therefore that we follow the recommendations of the independent pay bodies with this set of real terms pay rises each award is recommended by independent pay review bodies and this year the government has accepted the suggested rise for each workforce nhs choir 's tribute to those who have given their lives to save others the pay awards for the armed forces prison officers senior civil servants and nhs staff will be backdated to april the pay rise for police and teachers starts in september due to those professions

terms pay cuts for frontline workers tuc general secretary frances ogrady called for social care workers to join the ranks of those being offered a pay rise these rises are welcome but there s still a long way to go to restore pay after a decade of real terms cuts she said many public sector workers like job centre staff and local government workers are nt getting these rises they deserve a decent pay settlement too ms o'grady added the government should urgently announce a pay rise for social care workers campaign for countrywide thank you to coronavirus helpers on nhss birthday weekly tribute to coronavirus key workers as uk gathers again to clap for our carers boris johnson made a joke about the large room required to facilitate a socially distanced cabinet meeting at the foreign office the cabinet held its first socially distanced face to face meeting since march to get the country back on track amid the coronavirus pandemic he told his team of ministers welcome to the locarno suite which is the foreign offices idea of a modest seminar room conducted on such an opulent scale that we can both observe social distancing and meet as an entire cabinet face to face which i m sure you ll agree is the right thing to do because we need every human being needs the energy and the stimulation that comes from face to face meetings nothing propinks like propinquity as i think somebody once said i hope i speak for everyone in this room when i say we will not be blown off course by the coronavirus and we will get on with delivering our promises to the people as indeed we are johnson told cabinet ministers the pm said there was a huge amount of work to do and we have to get on with it he added whatever the current difficulties and they will go on we will have bumpy months ahead and as rishi sunak chancellor has rightly said there will be difficult months ahead for our people and our country but no one will be without hope we will build back better and come through this crisis more strongly than ever before government borrowing and uk 's national debt explode due to lockdown eu leaders clinch coronavirus recovery deal after marathon summit englands chief medical officer professor chris whitty has insisted there was no huge delay in the government taking action on coronavirus as helaunched a staunch defence of his actions over the pandemic in a heated exchange with former health secretary and chairman of the health and social care committee jeremy hunt professor chris whitty told mps that widespread community testing earlier on in the outbreak required an infrastructure we did not have prof whitty blamed incredibly limited testing capacity and previous failure to build up the uk 's health infrastructure for why a test trace and isolate system was not modelled ahead of the pandemic what was the governments biggest coronavirus mistake lead figures in the government 's response team are appearing before the commons health and social care select committee on tuesday to give evidence about the handling of the coronavirus pandemic asked by mr hunt if he was content the government followed his advice on staging different elements of the lockdown prof whitty said ministers at the time who were put in an incredibly difficult position in my view followed the advice given by sage which are clearly signposted through the minutes of sage he continued with a delay that was no more than you would reasonably expect for what are really very difficult things to operationalise and decide also speaking before the committee sage expert and wellcome trust director professor sir jeremy farrar said that he regrets the scientific advisory group for emergencies sage was not more blunt with its advice the sage expert warned that the world will be living with covid-19 for many years to come and dismissed boris johnson 's pledge of things returning to normal by christmas describing january and february as the absolute critical two months prof sir jeremy farrar said that the uk was slow to implement measures such as increased testing and personal protective equipment ppe for healthcare workers i think the lessons that korea singapore vietnam had learned from previous epidemics were well implemented and they acted quicker he told the committee prof farrar added the response to a pandemic has to be faster than the pandemic itself otherwise you get behind the curve it comes as new figures published by the ons show that 51,096 deaths involving coronavirus had occurred in england and wales up to july 10 and had been registered by july 18 figures published last week by the national records for scotland showed that 4,187 deaths involving covid-19 had been registered in scotland up to july 12 oxford vaccines could give double protection against covid-19 check coronavirus cases in your area with our interactive map while 844 deaths had occurred in northern ireland up to july 10 and had been registered up to july 15 according to the northern ireland statistics and research agency together the figures suggest that so far 56,127 deaths have been registered in the uk where covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate including suspected cases warning against complacency during the summer months professor farrar said june july and august were a crucial phase to prevent a second wave of covid-19 he told the committee if we have any sense of complacency of this is behind us then we will undoubtedly have a second wave and we could easily be in the same situation again francis crick institute director sir paul nurse told the commons health and social care select committee there had been pass the parcel during the coronavirus crisis sir paul told mps my experience in talking to advisers and also politicians is that i have never found it too easy to find out who is actually responsible for the different parts of the strategy and for that matter the tactics that are being put in place the commons health and social care select committee heard that research by the institute found up to 45 % of healthcare workers were infected at the height of the covid-19 pandemic my colleagues in the crick contacted downing street in march wrote to minister matt hancock in april emphasising two main things the importance of regular systematic testing of all healthcare workers including not only frontline doctors and nurses support staff ambulance drivers other healthcare providers such as the care homes gp surgeries community nurses and the like and these all needed to be tested nhs england

others and they were infecting their colleagues they were infecting patients yet they were nt been tested systematically sir paul told mps professor sir john bell of the university of oxford told the commons health and social care committee that one of the uks biggest failures was not being on the front foot in preparation for a pandemic but praised the discovery of new therapies and the hunt for a vaccine the race for a coronavirus vaccine what progress has been made and when will it be ready asked about the biggest failures during the pandemic he told mps the fact that we were asleep to the concept that we were going to have a pandemic i think shame on us since the year 2000 we ve had eight close calls of emerging infectious diseases any one of which could have swept the globe as a pandemic prof bell said a central issue to a lack of testing in hospitals was due to concerns over having to send staff home if they tested positive he told mps as time went on there still was nt a real push to test healthcare workers and indeed all patients in the hospital eu leaders clinch coronavirus recovery deal after marathon summit uk signs new deal for extra 90 million doses of

law mr raab said a spokesman for the chinese embassy in london said in a statement beijing had expressed its concerns over the uk interfering in hong kong matters which are internal affairs of china dominic raab addresses the commons on the decision the spokesman said now the uk side has gone even further down the wrong road in disregard of chinas solemn position and repeated representations it

washington has joined in criticising former tory leader sir iain duncan smith told the bbcs newsnight programme that many countries were concerned about the government in beijing he said this is a problem for the free world right now so france and germany are having to make decisions you ve got other countries elsewhere in europe and in the far east that are all worried about the dominance and the dependency that china is putting people into given the nature of its regime writing in the daily telegraph former canadian prime minister stephen harper said countries like britain must avoid a china centric view and called on mr johnson to help the uk assume a much greater role in global affairs than has been the case in many years frosty relations between the us and china led to president

dancing to the tune of the us and accusing western countries of trying to foment a new cold war with china but on monday mr raab took further action when he told mps the extradition treaty with hong

ban chinas huawei from 5 g network an arms embargo with mainland china has been in place since 1989 and that will now be extended to hong kong because of the extra powers beijing now has for the internal security of the territory mr raabs actions came after mr johnson promised a tough but calibrated response to beijing in an interview before mr raabs announcement the prime minister had promised to strike a balance in his approach to beijing resisting pressure from china hawks to take a hardline stance i m not going to be pushed into a position of becoming a knee jerk sinophobe on

almost nine months after the prime minister is believed to have received it completed more than a year ago the report has gone through a series of redactions as is procedure to remove sensitive information from the publics view russia report expected to show attempted interference in scottish referendum despite promises to publish it after the december general election the findings from the intelligence and scrutiny committee isc will be released just before parliaments summer recess but what is the report and why has been called for the russia report the investigation was launched after the poisoning of former russian spy sergei skripal and his daughter yulia in salisbury the report which became the primary focus of the isc following skripals poisoning compiles the findings from a months long investigation into potential russian interference into uk democracy concerns have been repeatedly expressed over alleged involvement in the brexit vote and even the 2019 general election on thursday foreign secretary dominic raab said russian actors almost certainly sought to interfere in the 2019 general election through the online amplification of stolen documents relating to us uk trade talks internet debate website reddit claimed leaked documents referenced by jeremy corbyn during the 2019 election were linked to a russian campaign the national cyber security centre also warned on thursday that hackers linked to russian intelligence agencies are targeting british scientists seeking to develop a coronavirus vaccine the iscs 2017/18 annual report states there have also been concerns about russias interference in the uks eu referendum at our first meeting in november 2017 the committee agreed to begin an inquiry into russian activity against the uk the annual report stated the poisoning of sergei and yulia skripal in march 2018 and subsequent attribution of the attack to russia by the uk government only serve to highlight the importance of this inquiry what will the report say we wo nt know what s in the report until it is published the isc is strictly forbidden from revealing the contents before it is formally made public two weeks after the prime minister received the report then isc chairman dominic grieve said he would nt dream of revealing the reports findings but he did say there is useful information for voters who were just weeks away from the general election last year at the time the report is informative and people are entitled to information and it seems to us that this report is germane because we do know and i think it is widely accepted that the russians have sought to interfere in other countries democratic processes in the past he added i can not think of a reason why he should wish to prevent this report being published the tory party 's russian donors one thing that may be in the report is information relating to russian tory donors according to the sunday times nine russian business people who have donated money to the conservative party were named in the document this has not been confirmed and the names of these donors have not been officially revealed but questions have previously been raised over the partys links with wealthy russians one of the most prolific donors is lubov chernukhin who has donated almost 2 million since 2012 according to the electoral commission more than 300,000 was donated in march this year alone taking her total registered donations to 1,978,304.40 mrs chernukhin is the wife of vladimir chernukhin a former close associate of vladimir putin serving as his deputy finance minister almost two decades ago the source of their wealth is unclear but she has previously won access to top tory politicians including a tennis match with boris johnson alexander temerko is another who has been identified in the past over his links to the party having donated 699,176.98 to date according to the electoral commission russia claims uk ' spoiling relationship between the two countries former tory party chairman and current minister brandon lewis who confirmed he has received donations from chernukhin and temerko defended the pair in november last year he said wealthy russian businessmen have the absolute right to donate to the conservative party if they are british citizens mr lewis said i have had donations from lubov chernukhin and also alexander temerko as has the conservative party they are british citizens they are prominent british business people as well alexander himself has invested in the renewable energy industry in the east of england so british citizens have the absolute right as any other british citizen does to invest in and be part of the british political scene and i think its wrong to accuse them of anything else he added once the election is out of the way we will publish that report what has the government said the government has repeatedly defended its position a downing street spokeswoman said last year there are a number of administrative stages / processes which reports such as this which often contain sensitive information have to go through before they are published this usually takes several weeks to complete the committee is well informed of this process in february this year boris johnson addressed the issue during prime ministers questions responding to snp mp owen thompson he said the report will of course be published when the intelligence and security committee is reconstituted he added his conspiratorial frame of mind is likely to be disappointed by the results russia report expected to show

central government funding of at least two percent next year boris johnson has confirmed under the settlement secondary schools will attract a minimum of 5,150 per pupil up from 5,000 this year while primary schools will get at least 4,000 per pupil up from 3,750 the department for education dfe said the annual increase of 2.2 billion would see most local authorities receive rises of at least 3 % per pupil there will be smaller rises for some historically higher funded local authorities while small and remote schools in rural areas will get additional cash reflecting the particular pressures they face labour said the increases would still leave schools worse off than they were when the conservatives first came to power in 2010 the increase is the second instalment of a three year settlement which will see annual funding rise by 7.1 billion over the period the prime minister said every child deserves a superb education regardless of which school they attend or where they happened to grow up that is why we are providing additional funding now and for the future for every school with those historically underfunded receiving the greatest increase education secretary gavin williamson said this year has been incredibly challenging for schools teachers and students due to the covid-19 outbreak not only are we confirming another year of increased and better targeted funding for our schools but with our transformative national funding formula we are making sure the money is distributed fairly across the country so all schools can drive up standards the dfe said schools would also benefit from the governments one off 1 billion covid-19 catch up package to make up for the impact of lost teaching time due to school closures under the scheme a secondary school with 1,000 pupils will receive 80,000 and a 200-pupil primary school will receive 16,000 but labour 's shadow education secretary kate green said the increases would still not reverse the austerity cuts to school budgets under the conservatives the fact is schools will still be worse off in 2023 than they were in 2010 under these plans as a direct result of the conservatives decision to cut school budgets she said the association of school and college leaders ascl welcomed the announcement that the government was continuing to deliver on the three year settlement but said it was disappointed it had not addressed the costs of bringing back schools safely after the lockdown it presently has no plans to reimburse additional costs incurred as a result of implementing the safety measures which must be introduced to enable the return of all pupils said ascl general secretary geoff barton these include extensive cleaning schedules large quantities of hand sanitisers extra hand washing facilities and cover for staff who are unable to attend because they are self isolating schools budgets are very tight and they simply do not have enough money to cope with a national emergency nick brook deputy general secretary of the naht school leaders union welcomed the additional funding for smaller schools but warned the money from the catch up package may not be enough a per pupil allocation will take account of the size of the school but is unlikely to reflect the scale of the challenge faced he said schools serving the most deprived communities may find that additional funding may not go far enough to address the true cost of this crisis schools face coronavirus bill of 25,000 to enable returns as heads warn we 're on knife edge senior medics have criticised the illogical messaging around face coverings which could risk the spread of coronavirus the british medical association bma said a second peak of covid-19 combined with a seasonal outbreak of flu could be devastating for the nhs the group voiced criticism of government guidance on the use of face coverings according to reports in the guardian no need for face coverings in offices or schools says hancock despite mandatory rule for shops face coverings compulsory in shops in england from july 24 here 's everything you need to know compulsory to wear face coverings in shops in england from 24 july face coverings are already compulsory on public transport in england and the government has made it mandatory to wear them in shops and supermarkets from july 24 to reduce the spread of coronavirus before introducing the mandatory rule in shops boris johnson had hinted at stricter rules on face coverings but cabinet minister michael gove said just days later that face coverings should not be made mandatory in shops but that he would encourage people to wear them out of courtesy and consideration last week heath secretary matt hancock said there was no need for face coverings to be made compulsory in offices or schools in england bma council chairman dr chaand nagpaul has said introducing coverings in shops but not workplaces or other areas where social distancing was impossible was illogical dr nagppaul said everyone has their role to play but there needs to be clear concise public messaging he added to introduce measures for shops but not other situations where physical distancing is not possible including some workplaces is illogical and adds to confusion and the risk of the virus spreading dr alison pittard head of the faculty of intensive care medicine warned the nhs could be overwhelmed by a second wave during seasonal flu she said if people do not wear face coverings the virus could spread to levels seen earlier this year the guardian reported she added people might think covid is over with why do i have to wear a face mask but it is nt over we still have covid patients in intensive care if the public do nt physically distance and do nt wear face coverings we could very quickly get back to where we were earlier this year their comments come after the prime minister played down the prospect of a second national coronavirus lockdown saying he did not want to use it any more than britains trident nuclear deterrent boris johnson i do n't think uk will need another coronavirus national lockdown mr johnson said the authorities were getting better at identifying and isolating local outbreaks although it was important that the power to order national action was held in reserve i ca nt abandon that tool any more than i would abandon a nuclear deterrent but it is like a nuclear deterrent i certainly do nt want to use it and nor do i think we will be in that position again he told the sunday telegraph his comments could lead to further tensions between ministers and their scientific experts after the chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance warned on friday there was a risk that national measures could be needed as winter approaches announcing another easing of lockdown restrictions in england mr johnson on friday said he hoped there could be a significant return to normality in time for

boris johnson 's pledge scientists say foreign secretary dominic raab says the uk will make sure the world knows the nature of the reprehensible behaviour that russia is engaged after accusing the country of recently been accused of targeting uk coronavirus vaccine researchers russia is also alleged to have attempted to influence the uk 's general election and interfering in the brexit referendum the long awaited russia reportis set to be published next week almost nine months after the prime minister is believed to have received it mr raab told sky news sophy ridge programme were absolutely confident that the russian intelligence agencies were engaged in a cyber attack on research and development efforts and organisations in this country and internationally with a view either to sabotage or to profit from the r&d that was taking place and i think the point is first of all we ve seen this as part of a wider systematic approach to cyber taken by russia and at the time that the world is coming together to try and tackle covid-19 particularly come up with a global solution for a vaccine i think its outrageous and reprehensible that the russian government is engaged in this activity so what were doing with our allies is making sure people know making sure the organisations know so that they can better defend against it but also just calling russia out we will do this now you will see us holding russia to account and making sure that the world knows the nature of the reprehensible behaviour that they re engaged in mr raab added as a leading member of the international community a permanent member of the security council russia should be engaged in that collaborative international effort in an interview with bbc ones the andrew marr show the russian ambassador to the uk andrei kelin said his country had no interest in interfering in british domestic politics specifically mr kelin moved to deny any involvement in hacking of information relating to coronavirus vaccine research i do nt believe in this story at all there is no sense in it mr kelin said i learned about their the hackers existence from british media in this world to attribute any kind of computer hackers to any country it is impossible completed more than a year ago the russia report has gone through a series of redactions as is procedure to remove sensitive information from the publics view despite promises to publish it after the december general election the findings from the intelligence and scrutiny committee isc will be released just before parliaments summer recess the investigation into the country was launched after the poisoning of former russian spy sergei skripal and his daughter yulia in salisbury shadow foreign secretary lisa nandy said that labour got it wrong on russia having prevaricated following the attack on salisbury she told sophy ridge i think we got it wrong on russia and i made a feature of this during the labour leadership campaign because i felt that it really needed to be said when the salisbury attacks happened we prevaricated we equivocated we called for dialogue at a moment when chemical weapons had been used on the streets of the uk and what that did was not only to let an authoritarian regime that has invaded its neighbours that has interfered in elections across european democratic countries over several years that has had an appalling record of human rights against its own people against lgbt people muslims and other minorities and used chemical weapons on the streets of the uk we did nt just let them off the hook we also let the conservative government off the hook because i believe the conservatives have been desperately slow to wake up to the threat that is posed by the current putin administration and we should have been much quicker to act in relation to that ms nandy said by prevaricating about issues like salisbury we let the tories off the hook i strongly believe that that has to change and that we have to have a much more strategic approach to russia russian hackers targeting coronavirus vaccine researchers uk agency warns almost certain russia tried to interfere in uk general election says dominic raab what is the russia report and why is it being published boris johnson said he does not think the uk will need another national coronavirus lockdown adding that he did not want to do that any more than use britain 's trident nuclear deterrent the prime minister said the authorities were getting better at identifying and isolating local outbreaks although it was important that the power to order national action was held in reserve i ca nt abandon that tool any more than i would abandon a nuclear deterrent but it is like a nuclear deterrent i certainly do nt want to use it and nor do

as winter approaches announcing another easing lockdown restrictions in england mr johnson on friday said he hoped there could be a significant return to normality in time for christmas at the same time he said the government had given local authorities new powers to close specific premises shut outdoor spaces and cancel events mr johnson told the telegraph its not just that were getting much better at spotting the disease and isolating it locally but we understand far more which groups it affects how it works how its transmitted so the possibility of different types of segmentation of enhanced shielding for particular groups is now there were genuinely able now to look at what s happening in much closer to real time to isolate outbreaks and to address them on the spot and to work with local authorities to contain the problem locally and regionally if we have to as he approaches his first anniversary in office mr johnson insisted his agenda for domestic reform and levelling up the economy would not be blown off course by the pandemic we want to be a transformative government because there s a massive opportunity in this country to do things differently and to do things better he said we ve seen that really exemplified in what happened with coronavirus the prime minister confirmed that as part of that he was looking at reform of the civil service in the wake of the announcement the cabinet secretary sir mark sedwill is stepping down please do nt think that i in any way underestimate the brilliance of the uk civil service they are absolutely fantastic he said but maybe there are ways in which we can all learn together to do things faster to have a real spirit of can do i m not saying that people do nt have that but there s an opportunity to learn from the crisis and to work faster i think sometimes its a question of confidence and belief professor sir ian diamond said he had not noticed any uptake in coronavirus since the lockdown measures were eased when asked if he had expected to see an increase in the number of infections as lockdown was lifted he told sophy ridge on sunday that it depended on how the population works he added the message has been quite consistent in that we must be alert and we must be socially distanced and if we are really super careful and if we are able to follow all the rules it does seem to me that we should expect there to be a relative flatline at the moment clearly over the autumn we will need to be ever vigilant the uk government is to stop publishing daily coronavirus deaths after health secretary matt hancock ordered an urgent review into how public health england phe calculates the figures the health secretary called for a review after researchers claimed the way covid-19deaths are reported across england has led to an over exaggeration of the figures due to statistical flaws phe 's calculation of the figures means englands deaths from coronavirus appear far higher than any other part of the uk experts behind the study said matt hancock orders urgent review into england 's covid-19 death figures uk coronavirus death toll increases by 114 to 45,233 on the coronavirus statistics page on saturday a statement said the government would be pausing the uk wide updates until issue was resolved the statement on the government 's website read the secretary of state has today 17 july askedpheto urgently review their estimation of daily death statistics currently the daily deaths measure counts all people who have tested positive for coronavirus and since died with no cut off between time of testing and date of death there have been claims that the lack of cut off may distort the current daily deaths number we are therefore pausing the publication of the daily figure while this is resolved in a blog entitled why no one can ever recover from covid-19 in england a statistical anomaly professors yoon loke from the university of east anglia and carl heneghan from the university of oxford said more robust data is needed into how the data was collated they argue that phe looks at whether a person has ever tested positive and whether they are still alive at a later date the five big changes to england 's coronavirus restrictions this means anyone who has ever tested positive for covid-19 and then dies is included in the death figures even if they have died from

pledge to deliver his vision in time for christmas leading scientists have warned the prime minister signalled another significant easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions in england on friday relaxing work from home guidance and paving the way for theatres and sports stadiums to reopen at a no 10 press conference he said it was his strong and sincere hope that ministers would be able to review the remaining restrictions from november onwards possibly in time for christmas boris johnson accused of passing the buck on work from home policy as england 's coronavirus restrictions ease the five big changes to england 's coronavirus restrictions however professor john edmunds a member of the governments scientific advisory group for emergencies sage has said a return to pre - lockdown normality is a long way off unfortunately i think it is quite a long way away he told the bbc radio 4 today programme if what you mean by normality is what we used to do until february and the middle of march this year go to work normally travel on the buses and trains go on holiday without restrictions meet friends shake hands hug each other and so on that s a long way off unfortunately we wo nt be able to do that until we are immune to the virus which means until we have a vaccine that is proven safe and effective if we return to those sort of normal behaviours the virus will come back very fast sir mark walport a former chief scientific adviser said it could prove difficult to achieve with respiratory illnesses tending to flourish in the colder weather he said that while the disease was declining there were still between 3,000 and 11,000 new cases a day in england it is going to be difficult we know that winter is when respiratory viruses thrive so it is going to be tough he told bbc2s newsnight the prime minister said hope for the best plan for the worst of course what we need to do as far as possible is prevent the worst coronavirus can i refuse to go back to work if i think it 's unsafe the five big changes to england 's coronavirus restrictions his comments echoed the chief medical officer for england professor chris whitty who warned measures such as hand washing isolation and household quarantine would be needed for a prolonged period giving evidence to the lords science and technology committee on friday he said it has not gone away so all of those need to continue for a long period of time the governments chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance who had previously warned against easing the work from home guidance told the committee that the winter would be a very complex time with people going down with other illnesses which were not covid-19 transport secretary grant shapps told itv news that great public understanding of the disease meant it would be easier to control outbreaks and enabled the country to take these next steps out of lockdown but he added that the government would not hesitate to go back to tougher measures if the situation called for it when we first said stay alert perhaps people were n't sure but now they know it 's about social distancing one metre plus taking mitigating measures washing your hands nothing touching your face wearing a face covering he said i think if you take all of those things together then it does give us a sense of being able to provide direction and some hope to people that if we can continue like this then this is where we can expect or hope to be but it will all depend on the data and wo n't hesitate to backtrack on these steps if that 's what we need to do which we 've done in other areas government to pause publishing daily coronavirus death figuresin his address the prime minister said it will be up to employers in england to discuss with workers whether it is safe to return from august 1 from that date also most remaining leisure centres will reopen and indoor performances with live audiences can resume if pilots are successful while trials will begin for sports stadiums to reopen from october mr johnson who also immediately scrapped the advice to avoid public transport said sir patrick and prof whitty had taken part in a cabinet discussion before the relaxation was announced however he said that ultimately decisions are taken by the elected politicians it means that from next month wedding receptions for up

report by itv news correspondent paul davies words by itv news multimedia producersuzanne elliott monday 22 june marks the third windrush day the 72nd anniversary of the ss empire windrush arriving at tilbury docks in essex carrying the first caribbean migrants many of those who left sunnier climes were ex - servicemen who fought with the uk in the second world war and had been invited to a bomb damaged britain to fill labour shortages windrush day was established as a celebration to honour the enormous contribution those who made that journey and others who followed from elsewhere have made to britain the annual event was established in 2018 in the wake the windrush scandal when many of those invited to britain suddenly found themselves on the wrong side of immigration laws that unbeknown to them had changed around them two years on from the inaugural windrush day their fight for justice continues windrush generation working group will right the wrongs of scandal patel says home office is to start making windrush payments under compensation scheme who are the windrush generation hmt windrush brought the first post - war migrants from jamaica trinidad and tobago and other caribbean islands then british colonies to the uk in 1948 there were just over 1,000 passengers on board that first sailing over a 23-year period an estimated half a million people made the 8,000 mile journey from caribbean islands encouraged to the uk to help rebuild a britain battered by war many arrived as children travelling on their parents passports and with no documents of their own few intended to stay for long but many did settle in the uk establishing communities raising families paying taxes even serving in the british armed forces contributing to what the 1940s adverts had referred to as the mother country economically socially and culturally then decades later many found themselves unable to prove they had the right to work or in some cases even live in the country they had called home for 50 years what was the windrush scandal adult windrush immigrants from the 1960s and early 1970s were usually given permanent right to reside stamps when they arrived on uk shores the 1971 immigration act confirmed that the windrush generation had and have the right to live in the uk but they were not given any documents to demonstrate their status and the home office did not keep a record of those granted leave to remain in the decades since the windrush generation had arrived in britain immigration law had changed as successive governments sought to get tough on border control culminating in then home secretary theresa mays hostile environment policy that began in 2012 home office failed to act on warning signs of windrush failings sajid javid vows to end hostile era for illegal immigrants immigration law in the uk now require people to have documentation to work rent a property or access benefits and nhs services which left many of this generation in a perilous situation people with a right to live in the uk found themselves with no papers and no rights as a result some lost their jobs their homes and according to a report into the scandal published earlier this year their sense of identity and wellbeing the home office said 164 people were wrongfully detained or deported from the country that had been their home for decades in her independent report from march windrush lessons learned review wendy williams said they were failed when they needed help most ms williams told itv news i 've made the point that the windrush scandal was both foreseeable and avoidable ms williams said i 've set out clearly why that was and the reason why it was was because there were warning signs both internally and externally that were drawn to the home office 's attention so what i say is is absolutely important for the department to learn the lessons of windrush i 've set out what needs to happen in order for that to occur and everyone is watching everyone is waiting and everyone is looking to the home office that 's both ministers and officials to lead that charge what happened next as the scandal broke the government was forced to act amber rudd the then home secretary resigned in the wake of it the windrush lessons learned review was ordered and a compensation scheme launched in july 2018 at an estimated cost of at least 200 million in march home secretary priti patel told the house of commons more than 11,700 people have been given some form of documentation since 2018 ms williams ' march report found the windrush scandal was foreseeable and avoidable with victims let down by systemic operational failings at the home office they had no reason to doubt their status or that they belonged in the uk she wrote is the compensation scheme working there has been concern among support groups working with those affected by the scandal about the slowness of compensation offers and the difficulties of the claiming official figures published last month revealed fewer than 5 % of claims made under the compensation scheme for victims have been paid out the most recent figures show home office has paid out 362,996 to just 60 people some 1,275 claims were made by the end of march with the number received by the department decreasing each quarter since it launched why has there been little uptake campaigners say those affected are not applying because they are not getting the support they need to navigate a bureaucratic legal system paul nichols 76 came to the uk in 1962 serving in the british army until he was demobbed in 1971 despite making the odd trip to barbados being on the electoral roll and even applying to be a councillor when mr nichols applied for a student loan in 2017 he discovered that as far as the home office was concerned he did nt exist it took mr nichols nearly a year to receive his papers despite the army having a record of his time serving he told itv news it was and continues to be unbelievably traumatic it was an experience i would nt wish on anybody it was unbelievable to say it was hostile would be an understatement i could nt believe the home office could do that he said imagine you made a vow to put your life on the line for the army and then are told we did nt even know you were here mr nichols has yet to apply for compensation citing the legal bureaucracy as a barrier to making a claim its a dehumanising process he says pointing out that those entitled to claim are the victims of the system that they are still trying to battle he told itv news in this particular instance you re not dealing with someone who broke a statute law you did nt do anything wrong you are the victim not the perpetrator its like you re trying to defend something that really and truly is not your fault mr nichols said he has not been offered any support to make his claim a situation replicated across many of those affected as campaigners fight to help them access the compensation they are entitled to on friday windrush campaigners delivered a petition to downing street signed by more than 130,000 people calling for action to address failings which led to the scandal and for swift compensation payments the home office has acknowledged more needed to be done regarding the compensations scheme and said it was working with community leaders so that all those affected can get the compensation they deserve as quickly as possible a home office spokesman said the home secretary has been clear that the mistreatment of the windrush generation by successive governments was completely unacceptable and she will right those wrongs wendy williams recommended that the home office should reflect carefully on the review before responding and we are committed to honouring that request the home secretary has also committed to provide an update to parliament before summer recess video report by itv news political correspondent carl dinnen prime ministerboris

said its very important that the public know that the governments expert advisers support the measures so we do need to hear that to ensure that there s confidence sir keir added that track trace and isolate and local lockdowns would be crucial measures to ensure a return to normality is done safely he said mayors across the country local authority leaders across the country are saying what we need is the data so we know precisely what s going on on a day to day basis on a street by street basis and we need the power to take action rapidly he also condemned mr johnsons criticism of care home workers handling of the coronavirus pandemic earlier this month the pm told the commons that too many care homes had not properly followed procedures implying that they were to blame for deaths sir keir said the prime minister was completely wrong to try and shift the blame to others particularly in the care sector who on the front line have been doing everything they can in difficult circumstances he added lets be honest about mistakes lets set out what they were and make sure they re not repeated coronavirus can i refuse to go back to work if i think it 's unsafe the cost of covid-19 in the uk in 45,000 lives lost and considerably more if excess deaths are included in long term illness for tens of thousands in damage to our prosperity is changing everything but did the shock have to be so great could the government have done more to protect us among the questions that will be examined by boris johnsons promised public inquiry is why vulnerable residents in care homes were put at serious risk why health care workers struggled for months to obtain vital protective equipment whether travellers from the viral hotspots of italy spain and france should have been quarantined whether the full lockdown could and should have been implemented a week or more earlier and why the uk did not increase virus testing capacity much earlier there is one question that overarches all the rest and it is why ministers and officials allowed the risk to build and build and build during february and early march the policy as recorded in the minutes of a meeting of the governments scientific advisory group for emergencieson 25 february was that interventions should seek to contain delay and reduce the peak incidence of cases in that order there was seemingly no consideration given till the illness was spreading virulently to the chinese korean taiwanese and singaporean strategies of attempting to eliminate the virus altogether through mass testing in the community and isolation of infected and potentially infected individuals to the contrary most of the early debate was about when to suspend test and trace in the population as a whole not how to expand it so what went wrong there is no defence for the government in ignorance of the risks i have trawled the minutes of the nine meetings in february of the scientific advisory group for emergencies sage the committee of scientists doctors and experts that has been shaping the governments response to the crisis and reviewed notes of my own contemporaneous meetings with ministers and officials this is what they show 1)the government knew from 11 february that unchecked coronavirus could cause the deaths of more than 500,000 people a senior minister that evening told me the risk is 60 % of the population getting it with a mortality rate of perhaps just over 1 % we are looking at not far off 500,000 deaths despite this desperately worrying risk that was communicated to ministers by sage members and notably the chief medical officer chris whitty sage that same day decided that it is not possible for the uk to accelerate diagnostic capability to include covid-19 alongside regular flu testing in time for the onset of winter flu season 2020 - 21 2)from 13 february there was an assumption that china would be unable to contain the virus sage and wider hmg should continue to work on the assumption that china will be unable to contain the epidemic the minutes say in other words sage knew that it was highly unlikely that the uk could insulate itself from covid-19 . 3 alsoon 13 february sage said that the most effective way to limit spread in prisons at this stage would be by reducing transfer of individuals between prisons but what now seems extraordinary and reckless is there was no similar recommendation to prevent care workers moving between care homes where residents were much more vulnerable than prisoners or to deter older people going to care homes from hospitals without first being tested for the virus 4)on 18 february sage identified that public health england did not have the capacity to carry out contact tracing finding those possibly infected for a case load of infected people greater than 50 new cases a week it tried to make a virtue of this weakness by deciding it would no longer be useful to continuing the tracing of infected people when there is sustained transmission in the uk in the event and disastrously some would say testing of infected people in the community and tracing those to whom they may have passed the virus was formally abandonedon 12 march 5)on 20 february sage approved public health englands strategy of discontinuing contract tracing when cases of coronavirus in the uk could no longer be directly linked to infection abroad 6)that same sage meeting said there was evidence of local transmission unlinked to individuals who have travelled from china in japan republic of korea and iran in other words china had failed to contain the virus 7)the official policy by25 february was one of relative fatalism in that sage concluded that interventions should seek to contain delay and reduce the peak incidence of cases in that order there was no consideration given to the chinese korean taiwanese and singaporean strategies of attempting to eliminate the virus altogether through mass testing and isolation of infected and potentially infected individuals the view of sage and of the chief medical officer chris witty and chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance quite explicitly was that the virus would have to work its way through the population one way or another 8)by27 february the reasonable worst case scenario was 80 % of the uk population become infected and 1 % dying and although this would equate to more than 500,000 deaths it was described in sages minutes as representing a reduction in the number of excess deaths relative to previous planning assumptions on 26 february the sage secretariat produced a briefing note for sage members saying there were no clinical countermeasures available for covid-19 and no vaccine was likely to be available in a uk epidemic 9)that same sage secretariat briefing note says asymptomatic transmission can not be ruled out and transmission from mildly symptomatic people is likely this is highly significant in view of the pms statement on 8 july at prime ministers questions that more measures to protect vulnerable residents in care homes had not been taken because the one thing nobody knew early on during this pandemic was that the virus was being passed asymptomatically from person to person in the way that it is what emerges from the sage minutes of those february meetings is that almost none of the havoc subsequently wreaked by coronavirus should have come as a surprise to its members or the whitehall ministers and officials it advises what they also show is that many weeks before the virus was present in the uk in any scale it was baked into official thinking that large scale testing would not be part of the solution why these are critical days for johnson 's government how will boris johnson fight the scourge of mass unemployment but those minutes leave unanswered a number of profoundly important questions they include a)why was no consideration ever seemingly given to rapidly expanding testing capacity so as to adopt the strategy so successful in asia and latterly in germany of testing infected people and rapidly tracing and isolating their contacts which eventually became british policy but too late to dampen the initial infection rate and death toll b)why was there never a single sage discussion in february of whether there was enough ppe protective clothing or equipment for healthcare workers and others at greatest risk of becoming infected or infecting the vulnerable c)was the cabinet secretary sir mark sedwill aware in february of the magnitude of the threat posed to the uk by the virus and did he become engaged in assessing whether enough was being done to protect the uk d)why was the health secretary matt hancock rather than the prime minister leading the political and government response to the virus until the beginning of march e)why and this is the biggest question of all had whitehall and ministers not learned the most important lesson from the banking crisis of 2007 - 8 which is that when there is a reasonable prospect of catastrophe it is far better to intervene early and with devastating force than do the minimum and hope for the best the problem for ministers whitehall officials and scientists is that it is not hindsight that condemns them the sage minutes from february are explicit that they had all the information they needed to protect the uk but for reasons they are yet to adequately explain they were never confident they could do more than reduce the peak incidence of cases the nhs will get an extra 3 billion in funding to prepare for a possible second wave of the coronavirus pandemic boris johnson is set to announce in the wake of a dire warning of the consequences of covid-19 rebounding downing street said the funding will allow extra hospital capacity while allowing routine treatments and procedures to continue the prime minister will also use a downing street press conference on friday to commit to a new target of reaching the capacity for 500,000 coronavirus tests a day by november the funding for the nhs in england will allow private hospital capacity to be used and for nightingale hospitals to be maintained until the end of march it comes after a report commissioned by the governments chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance warned there could be 120,000 hospital deaths in a reasonable worst case scenario winter always places a great strain on the health service but there are concerns a resurgence of the virus during the annual flu season could be crippling a downing street spokesman said thanks to the hard work and sacrifices of the british people the virus is under control and we have eased restrictions in a cautious phased way but the prime minister is clear that now is not the time for complacency and we must make sure our nhs is battle ready for winter tomorrow he will set out a broad package of measures to protect against both a possible second wave and to ease winter pressures and keep the public safe the spokesman said the immediate funding for england was new and not previously allocated while expenditure will be set out for the devolved nations in due course mr johnson is also expected to publish an additional chapter to the governments road map for recovery from the crisis nhs providers which represents nhs organisations welcomed the financial support to prepare with the triple whammy of pressures from winter a possible second surge and trying to recover from the strain of the pandemic so far but deputy chief executive saffron cordery called for urgent clarity over what the funding will cover saying funding is already in place for the nightingale hospitals and private beds trusts need more than that they have got to recover the lost ground of the last four or five months and put measures in place to manage the additional activity that always happens in winter she added sadly what we do know wo nt be included is social care social care across the country is in a critical condition and the government has still failed to commit to providing the sector with the funding it needs to be fully sustainable the british medical association also called for details on how the money will be used council chairman dr chaand nagpaul said the government talks of winter planning but we need transparency on this including how far this money can stretch in tackling a modelled worst case forecast including a second peak additional non - covid demand and a possible flu outbreak crucially the government must make prevention a priority and take every necessary step to try and avoid a national second spike all together earlier this week mr johnson was warned in the report by the academy of medical sciences that action must be taken now to mitigate the potential for a second peak including scaling up the test and trace system the research said capacity for 350,000 tests per day will be needed to test individuals as they show symptoms of either covid-19 or flu the latest government figures say capacity stood at nearly 338,000 but mr johnson will commit to increase this to half a million by the end of october to bolster test and trace health secretary matt hancock has already announced plans for the biggest flu vaccination programme in history with eligibility for free injections likely to be extended non - urgent operations were suspended to free up hospital beds as the uk was plunged into a lockdown during the first wave but downing street says the new plans to be announced by the pm will allow them to go ahead where possible as ministers target efforts on local lockdowns mr hancock announced a partial easing of the prolonged lockdown measures in leicester but said covid-19 rates in the city remained too high to allow pubs and restaurants to reopen but leicester mayor sir peter soulsby accused the government of penalising businesses and residents in a city that predominantly votes labour it is not yet clear what the pms update to the road map will be but he is eager to get employees back to their workplaces if they are safe the official government advice is still work from home if you can but mr johnson has said people should be talking to their bosses about looking to come back to work in a safe way but sir patrick his top scientific adviser showed some resistance to the change on thursday saying working from home remained a perfectly good option and there was absolutely no reason to change the advice video report by itv news political correspondent libby wiener leaked government documents highlighted by jeremy corbyn during last years general election were almost certainly amplified online by russian actors the government has said the papers relating to uk and us trade talks were used by the then labour leader to back his claims that the conservatives were preparing to sell off the nhs we 're in a position now to say that we believe that know with reasonable confidence that russian actors were involved in trying to interfere with the 2019 election in a written statement the foreign secretary dominic raab said that while there is no evidence of a broad spectrum russian campaign against the general election any attempt to interfere in our democratic processes is completely unacceptable a spokesperson for the prime minister said it was nonsense to imply the government made the statement on thursday to detract from a row over the chair of the intelligence and security committee backbench mp julian lewishad the conservative whip stripped amid claims he colluded with opposition mps to chair the committee over no.10 favourite chris grayling itv news security editor rohit kachroo on allegations that russian actors interfered in 2019 's general election and that hackers linked to therussianintelligence agencies are targeting british scientists seeking to develop acoronavirus vaccine the government has said the hotly anticipated report into russian interference in uk politics will be published before parliament rises for the summer next week after prime minister boris johnson was heavily criticised for blocking its publication ahead of last decembers general election in a written commons statement mr raab wrote on thursday on the basis of extensive analysis the government has concluded that it is almost certain that russian actors sought to interfere in the 2019 general election through the online amplification of illicitly acquired and leaked government documents sensitive government documents relating to the uk us free trade agreement were illicitly acquired before the 2019 general election and disseminated online via the social media platform reddit when these gained no traction further attempts were made to promote the illicitly acquired material online in the run up to the general election former labour leader jeremy corbyn refuses to answer questions whether he knew anything about russian interference as he arrives at his north london home on thursday whilst there is no evidence of a broad spectrum russian campaign against the general election any attempt to interfere in our democratic processes is completely unacceptable it is and will always be an absolute priority to protect our democracy and elections after labour highlighted the documents at a press conference in november reddit an online discussion site said that its own investigation had linked the appearance of the documents to a previous russian disinformation campaign the papers were believed to have appeared online some months earlier but attracted little attention until they were picked up by the labour campaign mr raab said that there was an ongoing criminal investigation into how the documents were obtained in a statement on thursday former leader jeremy corbyn said the documents the party revealed during the general election were genuine and said the tories were seeking to distract from the threat to the nhs and the tory party links to russian oligarchs on facebook the islington north mp wrote the documents we revealed during the general election about the danger of a trump trade deal for our nhs were genuine as is the threat of a 500 million a week higher drugs bill the tories want to distract from the damage a trump trade deal would do to our nhs by continuing to push the bogus claim labour received russian support todays government claim is an attempt to divert attention from the threat to the nhs and the tory party links to russian oligarchs expected to be revealed in the long buried parliamentary russia report removal of tory whip from mp called utter absurdity by ex - cabinet minister shadow foreign secretary lisa nandy said the reported actions of the russian intelligence services are wrong and should be condemned the labour party is committed to working with the government to protect the uks national security and safeguard our institutions from foreign interference none more so than those leading the international effort to develop a covid-19 vaccine the long overdue russia report must now be made public and the foreign secretary come to the house of commons and provide mps with concrete steps that will be taken to protect the uk from these kind of foreign cyber attacks russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova dismissed mr raabs ambiguous and confusing statement she said the uk had admitted there was no evidence of full scale interference by russia the statement is so foggy and contradictory that it is almost impossible to understand if it 's inappropriate to say something then do n't say it if you do say it then produce the facts a spokesperson for th erussian embassy said following the skripal attack in salisbury in 2018 when former russian spy sergei skripal and his daughter were poisoned with a deadly nerve agent novichok then prime minister theresa may said it was highly likely russia was behind it referencing mrs may 's chose of words ms zakharova said the british government has correctly decided that it is time to move on from the phrase highly likely now they are using a different phrase today the british government has bestowed a new pearl upon us

operations paul chichester said we condemn these despicable attacks against those doing vital work to combat the coronavirus pandemic foreign secretary dominic raab said it is completely unacceptable that the russian intelligence services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic while others pursue their selfish interests with reckless behaviour the uk and its allies are getting on with the hard work of finding a vaccine and protecting global health itv news security editor says the uk is looking at an offensive cyber force which could have hundreds of specialists involved but britain can only actually move when doing so in tandem with other states mr raab told itv news the attacks were pretty appalling and need calling out mr chichester said the ncsc would continue to work with its allies to protect our most critical assets adding that the current top priority is to protect the health sector imperial college london began coronavirus vaccine trials on

lewis slams improper bid to impose pms choice as head of security committee positive news is coming on oxford covid-19 vaccine writes robert peston video report by itv news correspondent stacey foster health secretary for england matt hancock has outlined adjustments to leicester 's local coronavirus lockdown from july 24 the local lockdown in the area will be partially relaxed mr hancock told mps including for schools and early years childcare in a statement he told the commons covid-19 rates in the city still remain well above the national average and the average for surrounding areas the health secretary also revealed an issue with some covid-19 test kits across england many were hoping for a full lifting of the restrictions itv news correspondent stacey foster explains mr hancock said use of randox swab test kits would be paused across all settings as they are not up to the usual high standard that we expect pressed on the issue by shadow health secretary jon ashworth mr hancock revealed the reason is that they had a ce stamp and upon investigation of the certification of that stamp the certification was not forthcoming and therefore physical checks were done and we found that the swabs were n't up to the standards that we expect mr hancock added there had been no evidence of any harm as a result of the issue and said test results had not been impacted outlining the changes to leicester 's lockdown the health secretary told mps were now in a position to relax some but not all of the restrictions that were in place from july 24 well be removing the restrictions on schools and early years childcare and taking a more targeted approach to the restrictions on non - essential retail leicester lockdown who 's in charge and how did it unfold how did the national coronavirus testing system fail leicester the devil is in the data he told the commons some say that the local lockdown is unnecessary i wish this were true but sadly it remains vital for the health of everyone in leicester and the rest of the country that these restrictions stay in place mr hancock continued restrictions like those for travel and only having social gatherings of up to six people for example will remain in force and measures introduced on july 4 like reopening the hospitality sector will also not yet apply on the latest infection rates in the area the health secretary said the seven day infection rate in leicester is now 119 cases per 100,000 people and the percentage of people testing positive is now at 4.8 % he said these are positive indicators especially in light of the huge increase in testing mr hancock compared the figures to when the local lockdown was imposed then the seven day infection rate was 135 and 10 % of tests were positive he thanked the people of leicester and leicestershire for their perseverance and hard work and committed to continuing to review the measures every fortnight mr ashworth who is mp for leicester south told the commons if we still have to make further personal sacrifice to keep people safe and hunt this virus down with the lockdown then so be it but added there would be a degree of dismay across the city in response to mr hancock 's remark the labour frontbencher said many businesses would want to know if they can get extra support if they can not reopen coronavirus what is a local lockdown and how does it work local lockdown extended in parts of leicester mr ashworth also pressed the health secretary on comments from the government 's chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance who has said the government was advised to implement lockdown measures earlier than it did mr ashworth asked why did it take a further seven days for the government to implement lockdown if sage was advising march 16 the health secretary replied of course 16 march is the day when i came to this house and said that all unnecessary social contact should cease he claimed that is precisely when the lockdown was started in an address to the nation on march 23 boris johnson announced a three week lockdown to limit the spread of coronavirus the new chair of parliaments intelligence and security committee has condemned downing streets attempt to impose its preferred candidate to lead the committee backbench mp julian lewis said he did not respond to a call to vote for former cabinet minister chris grayling as he considered it to be an improper request mr lewis was expelled from the parliamentary conservative party on wednesday after securing the prestigious isc chairmanship with the support of opposition members removal of tory whip from mp called utter absurdity by ex - cabinet minister in a statement he said that the 2013 justice and security act explicitly removed the right of the prime minister to choose the isc chairman and gave it to the committee members mr lewis said because the isc is a special committee i feel constrained in what i can say but added it was only yesterday afternoon that i received a text asking me to confirm that i would be voting for the prime ministers preferred candidate for the isc chair i did not reply as i considered it an improper request at no earlier stage did i give any undertaking to vote for any particular candidate the mp said number 10 had explicitly denied that the government was seeking to parachute a preferred candidate in to the chair adding it is therefore strange to have the whip removed for failing to vote for the government 's preferred choice of candidate speaking during a visit to nottinghamshire labour leader sir keir starmer said of the intelligence and security committee chairmanship issue i did n't know what was going to happen it 's an independent committee they choose their own chair and they obviously chose to reject the imposition by the prime minister of his preferred chair on them that 's a matter for them we should respect the decision they came to sir keir added it 's a very important committee

itv news scotland correspondent peter smith nicola sturgeon has admitted she is nervous about lockdown relaxations coming into force today in scotland describing them as by some margin the highest risk changes so far huge changes in scotland 's restrictions are being implemented today allowing among other relaxations indoor pubs cafes restaurants hairdressers and barbers to open but with enhanced hygiene practices with the risk of the virus spreading indoors in a pub for example is significantly higher than it is outdoors ms sturgeon said it was important people follow guidelines in order to avoid a return to full lockdown as has been seen in leicester and california it is vital more vital than it has been at any stage of this crisis so far that all of us stick rigidly to the rules and guidance on how to behave in these different settings what does lockdown easing look in england scotland wales and northern ireland nicola sturgeon confirms scotland will move to phase three of the easing of lockdown she said scotland had taken its biggest step so far out of lockdown as it went a full week without any new coronavirus deaths the first minister said no covid-19 deaths have been reported in the last 24 hours the seventh day in a row without a rise in fatalities but she pointed to the tightening of restrictions in california where bars cinemas and restaurants have had to close again that must be a reminder that our progress out of lockdown could yet go into reverse she warned and it will go into reverse if we see signs that the virus is starting to spread widely in the community again so all of us must do everything we can to ensure that does nt happen she encouraged people to take advantage of the added freedoms buy supporting businesses but urged caution as she suggested she would be prepared to reinstate restrictions prevalence of the virus in scotland has now fallen to very low levels the first minister said but as we all go out and about more it becomes increasingly important we are very alert hyper vigilant to any early warnings that case numbers might be starting to increase again what 's changing in scotland from today wednesday the childcare sector can fully open venues like museums galleries and other attractions can also welcome visitors hairdressing services resume cinemas can open their doors places of worship can reopen for communal services and prayer for up to 50 people if that can be accommodated within physical distancing tourism sector can also fully reopen hotels and bed and breakfasts indoor hospitality can reopen such as pubs and restaurants a clear majority of the public say so called gay conversion therapy should be banned according to a poll shared exclusively with itv news the findings come as campaigners call on the government to announce a ban next week after two years of delays 62 % of those surveyed by yougov on behalf of the ozanne foundation which campaigns to end conversion therapy said that they support a ban the christian charity that claims you can change your sexuality revealed the uk church that claims god can fix gay people only 14 % said they do not with the rest saying that they do not know those with a religious affiliation were only slightly less likely to want a ban with 57 % in favour versus 15 % who are not itv news understands the equalities minister liz truss is still finalising plans for a ban which have yet to be signed off by the cabinet but parliament breaks for its summer holiday next wednesday so there are concerns that a ban could be delayed beyond then this week itv news spoke to tom not his real name),who spent three years in group therapy sessions trying to turn himself straight he told us there 's a secrecy around it you 're encouraged not to tell anyone you 're part of it they would ask you to talk about how often you have been tempted to think in a gay way there were a lot of questions about family upbringing and childhood experiences we were made to feel that we would all achieve what we were looking for which was to eventually marry a woman and have a family "instead tom says he was left feeling suicidal there were definitely times that i felt i did n't really want to go on there were times where i felt there was no real hope he said eventually he quit the group and has now embraced his sexuality tom was first referred for conversion therapy by mike davidson who runs the core issues trust and still practices from his office near belfast when we met mr davidson to show him our interview with tom hetold us he was sent to somebody who is registered as a qualified psychiatrist you can not ban people 's human right to plan the trajectory they want to go in mr davidson added people should be free and we should give them the right and freedom to go in the direction they they want to he continued banning just simply wo n't work that 's not what democracy is and that 's not what scientific debate is what are they going to do are they going to ban conversations between people over the past two years itv news has uncovered the many forms in which so called conversion therapy still takes place in britain at winners chapel in dartford our undercover reporter was told that hishomosexualitywas caused by the deviland was offered intensive prayer while the christianorganisationjourney uk provided textbooks toanother of ourundercover reporters saying thathomosexuality was a neurosis at the time the then prime minister theresa may promised itv news she would ban conversion therapy but two years on the new government is yet to announce its plans in june liz truss told mps conversion therapy is a vile abhorrent practice that we want to stop we have commissioned research to look at the scope of the practice in the uk and we will publish our plans shortly after we receive that research those comments were interpreted as a promise to update the commons before recess with only a few days left before mps go on their summer break other countries including germany and malta have already outlawed conversion therapy with the un last month calling for a global ban now one of the uk government 's own lgbt advisors jayne ozanne who has been through the therapy herself has told itv news that patience is running out she said during those two years how many young lives have been ruined how many young lives have been lost i consented to go through it because i thought it was the right thing to do it nearly cost me my life we need to be absolutely clear that it is wrong it is torture let 's eradicate it once and for all and having already spent much of his youth agonising over his sexuality tom does n't want any more time to be wasted i have huge regret he told us looking back i do n't think i was looking for someone to make me straight i was just looking for someone to tell me it 's okay to be gay religious leaders press equalities minister to ban conversion therapy amid possible delay legal action warning over gay conversion allegations after itv news investigation nicola sturgeon said she does not want to make people arriving in scotland from other parts of the uk quarantine if i can avoid it as scotland entered its latest round of lockdown easing measures speaking on the peston show the first minister was asked if she had the powers to make people south of the border quarantine in scotland if there was to be a spike in imported covid-19 cases it comes as pubs cafes restaurants hairdressers and barbers reopened in scotland for the first time since march nicola sturgeon ' nervous as scotland enters ' highest risk stage of relaxing lockdown scottish first minister nicola sturgeon announces the country will move from phase 2 to phase 3 ms sturgeon said scotland would have the ability through public health measures to ask people to quarantine if they came to scotland and i 've said again this is not political it is not constitutional i 'm taking these decisions purely from a public health perspective she added but that 's not something i want to do if we can avoid that i think the first thing we want to do is work very constructively as we do already with authorities in england to look at good outbreak management and where that requires localised travel restrictions then rely on that in the first instance but i 'm not going to shy away from doing anything that i think is necessary and appropriate and effective in protecting people in scotland from a virus that we know now to our painful cost can take life and also as we are increasingly learning can do a lot of long term health damage to people earlier this week ms sturgeon said the scottish government had to take a very close look to make sure the virus was not coming to scotland from other parts of the uk ms sturgeon also defended her decision to ease lockdown at a slower rate than england saying it put them in better stead to drive down covid-19 cases which in turn would give scotland a more sustainable foundation for economic recovery that 's not something i want to do if we can avoid that sturgeon on quarantining english visitors in scotland she also said her focus was 100 % on leading scotland through the pandemic and that no thought had been given to another independence referendum this is the biggest crisis our country has faced the biggest crisis the world has faced in any of our lifetimes and i think any politician in a leadership position that does n't give it that focus i think would find themselves on the wrong side of public opinion pretty quickly ms sturgeon said support for independence was rising before the pandemic you know maybe i said this in an interview earlier in the week maybe there is a lesson in this for my party and for the independence movement in scotland that at a time when we 've not been talking about it and focusing on taking good decisions that are within our power to take we 've seensupport for independence rise the conservative mp who beat ex - cabinet minister chris grayling to become the chair of parliaments intelligence watchdog has had the tory whip removed dr julian lewis secured the role after working with labour mps to defeat mr grayling in the conservative dominated intelligence and security committee in a move that caught westminster by surprise the tory leadership then took disciplinary action against dr lewis as sources said the mp had acted with the opposition for his own advantage no need for face coverings in offices or schools says hancock despite mandatory rule for shops after the tory whip was removed from dr lewis a senior government source said the removal of the whip was because the mp was working with labour and other opposition mps for his own advantage prime minister boris johnson was widely believed to want former transport secretary mr grayling to become the chairman of the body which oversees the work of mi5 mi6 and gchq but the committee members voted instead for former defence select committee chairman dr lewis with the conservatives enjoying a majority with five out of nine places on the committee there had been concern at westminster that the tory members would be whipped to support mr grayling despite concerns about his expertise former national security adviser lord ricketts warned that mr grayling does not match up to the authority and reputation of former chairs following dr lewiss success lord ricketts said the body was now in the hands of someone with much wider experience of defence and security as well as mr grayling and dr lewis the members of the isc are tory mps theresa villiers sir john hayes and mark pritchard labour mps dame diana johnson and kevan jones the labour peer admiral lord west and the snp mp stewart hosie mr johnson has faced criticism over the delay in appointing the committee which has not met since the last parliament was dissolved in november last year the committee has yet to publish its long awaited report into russian interference in uk politics after mr johnson refused to clear it for release before last years general election a committee source told the pa news agency this was a secret ballot but clearly for him mr grayling to lose some tories decided not to vote for him labours deputy leader angela rayner branded the move against dr lewis grubby she tweeted julian lewis mp has the tory whip removed after being elected as chairman of the intelligence and security select committee after beating hapless chris grayling i wonder who in no . 10 ordered that the long serving tory mp had the whip removed what a grubby shower they are labour former frontbencher chris bryant said its a momentous failure of intelligence when a pm takes months to handpick intelligence and security committee members so as to deliver the chair he wants and they refuse to do his bidding to then chuck the new chairman out of the party is to lose control the plot snp defence spokesman stewart mcdonald mp said this is another total shambles from the tory government which has failed to put in place a functioning intelligence and security committee for more than six months since the election with his abysmal record of failure as a tory minister chris grayling is the only man who could lose a rigged election but it is right the committee has elected a chair and it should now get on with the crucial job of ensuring scrutiny and oversight of security matters after months of delay liberal democrat foreign affairs spokesman alistair carmichael said mr johnson had appointed yes men to the isc but true to form however failing grayling has been undone in his bid to be chair i hope we now have a committee with real teeth that can hold this government to account he added that starts by publishing the report into russian interference of our democracy before the summer recess so mps can scrutinise it fully beijing has accused britain of working with the us to discriminate oppress and exclude chinese firms warning of jeopardised relations after huawei was banned from the uks 5 g network boris johnson faced a diplomatic backlash on wednesday in response to his major u - turn over the chinese tech giant a move which president donald trump claimed credit for the prime minister ordered telecoms firms to remove huawei equipment from the uk 's 5 g network by 2027 a move costing billions and delaying the deployment of 5 g by up to three years donald trump takes credit for convincing uk to ban chinas huawei from 5 g network chinese tech firm huawei banned from uk 5 g network culture secretary announces why does n't britain trust huawei and what does the ban mean for me the ban came after a government ordered review found the security of huawei 's equipment could not be guaranteed because of us sanctions chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying warned in a briefing that the ban will only hurt the uk 's own interests adding this is a big world and the uk is just a small part of it without any evidence the uk under the pretext of risks which do nt exist at all cooperated with the us to discriminate oppress and exclude chinese companies in violation of the principle of market economy and free trade this breaches the uks promises she said the uk has made the wrong decision that undermines severely the chinese companys interests and the mutual trust between china and the uk this is about china facing a major threat in its investment security in the uk and our confidence whether the uk market can maintain openness fairness and non - discriminatory we have severe concerns on that and we remind all chinese companies to pay attention to the increasing political and security risks meanwhile in london chinas ambassador to the uk liu xiaoming accused britain of behaving like a junior partner of the us he suggested ministers imposed the ban because they had to succumb to pressure from the china hawks and china bashers while huaweiukvice president jeremy thompson told itv news the ban on his firm was not about trust but about american protectionism mr johnson acted on tuesday after coming under pressure from his own mps on the tory backbenches and from mr trumps administration as the uk tries to broker a post - brexit trade deal with the white house in a press conference mr trump spoke of having convinced many countries including the uk not to use huawei the us president said i did this myself for the most part adding if they want to do business with us they ca nt use it us secretary of state mike pompeo will fly to the uk for talks next week expected to cover 5 g and china as well as a possible transatlantic trade deal health secretary matt hancock acknowledged the us sanctions played a role in the ban and said trade discussions were also an important consideration but insisted it was a sensible decision we all know donald trump do nt we he told sky news all sorts of people can try to claim credit for the decision but this was based on a technical assessment by the national cyber security centre about how we can have the highest quality 5 g systems in the future downing street insisted it was a uk decision in response to the assessment of the sanctions from the us which were like nothing we had ever seen before the us imposed the sanctions it was then for the ncsc national cyber security centre to assess the impact of those sanctions on the security of the uks 5 g network the prime ministers official spokesman said the uks government was clear eyed about dealing with china but we remain committed to a constructive relationship huawei which denies being a security threat urged ministers to reconsider the move telecoms firms will be banned from next year from purchasing new 5 g equipment from huawei and will have to remove all the chinese companys kit by 2027 they are also expected to be ordered to shift away from the purchase of huaweis equipment for full fibre broadband networks over a period lasting up to two years in january the firm was given permission to play a limited role in the 5 g network but downing street insiders acknowledged the sanctions imposed by the white house in may were a game changer ministers ordered a review by the national cyber security centre into huaweis role in the uk after the sanctions barred huaweis access to products based on us semiconductor technology the ncscs technical director ian levy said products adapted to cope with the restrictions are likely to suffer more security and reliability problems because of the massive engineering challenge ahead of them and he said it would be harder for us to be confident in their use within the mitigation measures already in place for the high risk firms equipment

hostile state ' says ambassador as he admonishes uk over huawei decision johnson ousts huawei but slower than his tory critics wanted prime minister boris johnson has committed to an independent inquiry into the government 's response to the coronavirus pandemic speaking at pmqs mr johnson said i do not believe that now in the middle of combating still as we are a pandemic is the right moment to devote huge amounts of official time to an inquiry but of course we will seek to learn the lessons of this pandemic in the future he added in response to a question from liberal democrat 's temporary leader ed davey no need for face coverings in offices ' says hancock despite rule for shops sir ed said an inquiry was needed due to britain having suffered one of the worst death rates in the world under the rule of mr johnson it came after labour leader sir keir starmer accused the prime minister of failing to prepare for a second peak of coronavirus after a government commissioned report predicted almost 120,000 people could die without urgentpreparation sir keir said july and august must be a period of intense preparation for a second spike and criticised the government 's track and trace system as currently not being good enough job retention bonus wo n't save everyone and people will lose jobs sunak warns it is vital that the government learns the lessons from the mistakes that have been made and acts now to save lives for the future he said in the commons one of the key recommendations in this report commissioned by the governments office for science is that testing and tracing capacity will need to be significantly expanded to cope with increased demands over the winter the reality is this trace and track is not working as promised as it stands today the prime minister responded describing the uks covid-19 test and trace system is as good as or better than any other system in the world uks economic recovery is disappointing but there s reasons for optimism and yes it will play a vital part in ensuring that we do not have a second spike this winter he added mr johnson later claimed sir keir has more briefs than calvin klein as he attacked sir keir over a perceived lack of consistency it came after the labour leader warned the pm is kidding no one by claiming everything is a stunning success in response to the covid-19 pandemic watch pmqs in full the health secretary has said there is no need to for face coverings to be made compulsory in offices or schools despite a rule due to be implemented forcing people to wear them in shops in england matt hancock admitted there were broader issues with some of the new restrictions being introduced for example with beard trims being permitted but facial treatments being banned but said there was an explanation for the discrepancy between shops offices and schools the reason is that where a mask is useful is where you 're seeing somebody for a short to medium period of time if you 're in the same room as them for the full day like in an office together or for instance teachers in schools then we do n't think that masks make much difference he told itv 's lorraine he said face coverings had already been made mandatory on public transport and will be made compulsory in shops from july 24 because you 're seeing different people and for relatively short periods of time and so the masks then help in scotland masks have been mandatory in shops since friday coronavirus compulsory to wear face coverings in shops in england from 24 july senior cabinet office minister michael gove was recently pictured in a shop without a face covering after saying it was good manners to wear one but mr hancock defended his colleague saying the photograph was taken before an announcement on coverings had been made despite ministers now admitting face coverings are useful in slowing the spread of coronavirus the rule enforcing them in shops will not come in to force until july 24 the health secretary said the delay in implementation is to give businesses 10 days to get things organised he added we recommend wearing a mask in shops and we are going to make it mandatory from july 24 onwards i think that gives people the clarity they have been seeking he also sought to explain why beard trims were considered safe but facials are not a beard trim is quick and essentially defined as part of a haircut so i know that in all these rules we have had to bring in they all have issues around the boundaries that have been complicated and people would have wrestled with all the way through mr hancock was also quizzed about rules imposed early on in lockdown and admitted some of them caused confusion and could have been clearer asked about family members missing funerals of loved ones he said it was not the intention to stop very close family members going to funerals that is how the guidance was interpreted that obviously meant that we had nt written that guidance as clearly as we should have done i saw that and we changed it and my heart goes out to everybody involved video report by itv news correspondent rachel younger shop assistants have said they fear abuse from customers over mandatory face coverings the government has announced that from july 24 shoppers will be legally obliged to wear face coverings in supermarkets but it is unclear whether this guidance applies to other food retailers like cafes bakeries and delis rizwan ahmed a shop assistant at a small supermarket in maida vale london said most customers arrive without face coverings despite signs requesting they wear one mr ahmed 38 said i ve been telling everyone to wear masks but people do nt care now some people wear them some do nt say we have 100 people pass through the shop about 10 will be wearing a mask he said having to enforce the new law will create a difficult situation for shop assistants adding there could be trouble because some customers mind supermarket assistant holly 34 from solihull agreed the restriction is likely to cause tension between staff and customers she told pa we have had people become very irate when we have had to limit purchases and remind them about the one way system so yes i do think myself and the colleagues will get more abuse from members of the public especially our regulars who probably think we will let them off face coverings compulsory in shops in england from july 24 here 's everything you need to know she added the restriction is too little too late and the police do not have time to deal with shoplifters let alone people failing to wear a mask according to a yougov poll on july 12 38 % of people in the uk said they wear a face covering in public spaces up from 13 % on may 1 and six percent the day before lockdown was enforced on march 27 victoria szatmari 28 who manages peppermint cafe in maida vale said she believes most customers will be conscious about wearing a mask but is a little worried about whether she will be expected to enforce it elena a bakery manager in london who did not want to give her full name said she is also unsure whether the restriction will apply to her shop and worries warm weather may make customers less likely to comply she added i m from italy and a lot of people there are complaining about wearing masks because its really really hot and i completely understand how they feel definitely some people will get angry or annoyed about it she said the department for health told pa it will keep the regulations under review and will continue assessing if measures need to be put in place for other settings going forward though has not clarified which settings are included initially according to their latest guidance the public should wear a face covering in enclosed public spaces where social distancing is nt possible and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet helen dickinson chief executive of the british retail consortium said she supports the restriction but warned that retailers must not be responsible for enforcing it she said with hundreds of incidents of violence and abuse directed at retail staff every day we welcome the announcement that enforcement will be left to the authorities rather than potentially putting hardworking retail colleagues in harms way trade union usdaw said the governments announcement on face coverings leaves many questions unanswered and agreed enforcing the rule could become a flashpoint for abuse usdaw general secretary paddy lillis said it is right to make the wearing of face coverings mandatory in shops but there must now be clear and detailed guidance from the government we urge them to develop and agree that with usdaw and retail employers as we successfully did on joint safety guidance for the reopening of high street shops with the british retail consortium shops can call police if customers fail to wear face covering no 10 hints work from advice will be scrapped as pm

this year the culture secretary has confirmed in a major policy u - turn oliver dowden also announced that all huawei equipment currently being used within uk 5 g will have to be completely ripped out by 2027 no new kit is to be added from january 2021 and uk 5 g networks will be huawei free by the end of 2027 mr dowden said huawei said the decision means bad news for anyone in the uk with a mobile phone and threatens to move britain into the digital slow lane mr dowden admitted this will have real consequences for the connections on which all our constituents rely updating mps in the house of commons mr dowden added the decision had been made after us sanctions imposed in may forced the 5 g giant to use untrusted microchips in their products a spokesman for huawei uk said the firm 's future in the uk had been politicised and claimed the move is about us trade policy and not security why does n't britain trust huawei and what does the ban mean for me by the next election mr dowden said an irreversible path for the complete removal of huawei equipment from 5 g networks will have been implemented before sanctions the firm was using us made microchips which meant britain 's security agencies were certain they could vet huawei 's equipment and avert any threat sanctions are forcing huawei to produce their own chips most likely from china and the national cyber security centre ncsc which assesses the threat of tech firms to the uk advised ministers they could no longer guarantee to nullify the risk itv news asia correspondent debi edward explains how the news has been received in china the ncsc said huawei has zero access to alternatives which the uk has sufficient confidence in they found the new restrictions make it impossible to continue to guarantee the security of huawei equipment in the future the chinese ambassador to the uk liu xiaoming branded the governments announcement on huawei wrong he tweeted disappointing and wrong decision by the uk on huawei it has become questionable whether the uk can provide an open fair and non - discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries the ban on huawei will delay the uk 's full rollout of 5 g by two to three years and the transition to an alternative will cost up to 2 billion tech expert matthew howett has estimated the delay 's cost to the economy to be as much as 6.8 billion in terms of lost benefit it 's about attracting new industries and new investment from manufacturers that want to take advantage of the 5 g capability all that gets lost if you slow us down he said mr dowden admitted the rollout of 5 g will be transformative for our country but said it will only be useful if we have confidence in the security and resilience of the infrastructure it is built upon mr dowden said the government had always been clear eyed from the start that huawei was high risk but added that the us sanctions against huawei was a significant material change and one we have to take into consideration huaweiukvice president jeremy thompson said the ban on his firm was not about trust but about american protectionism he claimed the sanctions were designed to protect american interests this is a trade war he said the americans have under invested in mobile pretty much since the second generation and here we are on the fifth generation he added there are two ways of winning a race you can either run faster in our business that 's you invest in r and d or trip up the competition the americans have chosen to trip up the competition but us president donald trumps national security adviser praised britains decision robert obrien who is in europe this week said the reported uk action reflects a growing international consensus that huawei and other untrusted vendors pose a threat to national security as they remain beholden to the chinese communist party we look forward to working with the uk as well as our many other partners and allies to spur innovation promote vendor diversity in the 5 g supply chain and ensure 5 g security free from dangerous manipulations huawei has operated in the uk for more than 20 years and played an integral role in the rollout of the 2 g 3 g and 4 g networks huawei equipment will be allowed to remain within the infrastructure for these networks as us sanctions do not affect them and tech used prior was more easy to monitor providers of full fibre broadband will be told transition away from new huawei equipmentand will be allowed to do so in a two year period the government 's aim of full fibre broadband being available across the uk by 2025 remains in place before us sanctions were imposed boris johnson had opted to not ban huawei from 5 g but limited to no more than 35 % in the periphery of the network describing the firm as a high risk vendor that ban on huawei from the core of 5 g remains in place shadow digital science and technology minister chi onwurah called on the government to get a grip get a plan and secure our critical communications infrastructure our digital economy and our national security she added this is a car crash for our digital economy but one which could have been visible from outer space the china britain business council said britain risks falling behind in the global race to introduce and exploit this vital technology it added we understand that the intelligence agencies underlying assessment of huaweis involvement in 5 g has not changed if this is right this decision is a response to assertive us trade policy rather than to any real or perceived problem with huawei products the government will seek to legislate at the earliest opportunity with a new telecoms security bill to put in place the powers necessary to implement this tough new telecoms security framework it will give the government the national security powers to impose these new controls on high risk vendors and create extensive security duties on network operators to

against the home secretary which emerged overnight from when she ran the department for international development mr johnson failed to confirm if he knew about bullying allegations which had been levelled against her before he appointed her as home secretary mr corbyn said the latest allegations that ms patel bullied staff in a third government department would suggest a shocking and unacceptable pattern of behaviour if they were found to be true but mr johnson offered his support to ms patel who was sat on the government front bench for prime minister 's questions before

would look at issues beyond sir philip 's claims there are established process for civil servants to raise issues with their line manager and through the permanent secretary of their department any issues raised can be passed to the cabinet office scientists have cautiously welcomed boris johnsons suggestion that face coverings may become mandatory in shops in england the prime minister said on friday that he wanted to be stricter on insisting people wear coverings in confined spaces where they are meeting people they do not normally see face coverings are currently compulsory on public transport and in hospitals in england but are now mandatory in shops in scotland the uk government insisted early on in the pandemic that masks were not necessary for use by the general public when out and about but the pm signalled a shift in policy during an online question and answer session with the public on friday afternoon he said i do think we need to be stricter in insisting people wear face coverings in confined spaces where they are meeting people they do nt normally meet we are looking at ways of making sure that people really do have face coverings in shops for instance where there is a risk of transmission eminent epidemiologist professor david heymann of the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine said masks should be worn by all people in a situation where no one can physically distance to prevent infection of others he said face masks protect others from infection by catching virus containing droplets when a person who is infected and has a high level of virus in the nasal passage speaks shouts sings coughs or sneezes face masks should be worn when physical distancing can not be assured from others such as by carers in care homes and by people serving others who are physically distancing but who because of their work can not physically distance from them they should also be worn by all people in a situation where no one can physically distance to prevent infection of others especially in closed spaces such as public transport face masks do not substitute for physical distancing if physical distancing is possible and they do not protect the wearer from infection unless they are worn as part of personal protective equipment that also protects the eyes a potential site of infection dr paul hunter professor of medicine at the university of east anglia said the pm was right to be reviewing englands position on face coverings he said it was unlikely that the scientific debate on the issue would be resolved anytime soon but that shops may be an example of a place where it is not possible to maintain social distancing however if it is mandated to wear them in shops this raises the issue of whether they should be mandated in other contexts he explained dr hunter also cautioned the most important thing however is that anyone wearing a mask must not assume that they are automatically protected people should still practice distancing and continue to wash their hands university of bristol professor adam finn said that wearing face coverings in crowded places will reduce the likelihood of that happening the more efficient the face covering is at catching the droplets the better it will work so if you are in a shop and everyone else is wearing a mask you should feel safer than if they are nt shadow health secretary jonathan ashworth urged the government to conclude this review rapidly to provide the strong and clear guidance needed however ucl epidemiologist dr antonio lazzarino said he was worried masks are a pretence to ease the lockdown to help the economy this may well happen at the expense of peoples health lockdown is the only measure that is proven to work welsh first minister mark drakeford said he did not think the evidence on wearing face coverings was decisive yet i agree that as time goes on there is more emerging on the side of supporting face coverings in public he said but i do nt think it is decisive yet when the debate reaches a point if it does when the advice changes then the position will change in wales the latest figures from the office for national statistics suggested more than half 52 % of adults in britain who left their home in the week before being surveyed had worn a face covering the survey was conducted between july 2 - 5 and is up from the previous week when 43 % reported doing so tory former health secretary jeremy hunt said people should wear face coverings in shops as he called for simple government messaging the chairman of the commons health and social care committee told bbc radio 4s today programme i m afraid i do go all nanny on that one i understand the public health advice which is that if there s a risk of being less than two metres close to someone then you should wear it but if not you do nt have to but it does nt answer the basic question which is if i m going shopping should i wear a face mask or not and i think with public health advice in a pandemic you just need simplicity so i would favour saying we should wear face masks in shops earlier this week the world health organisation acknowledged there is emerging evidence that covid-19 could be spread through particles in the air and the president of the royal society professor venki ramakrishnan said everyone should wear a face covering in public to reduce the risk of a second wave of covid-19 infection boris johnson has urged people togo back to work if they can a significant shift from the government 's policy of telling people to work from home the pm said people should try to lead their lives more normally as coronavirus restrictions are eased after months of lockdown in an online question and answer session with the public mr johnson said i want people to go back to work as carefully as possible its very important that people should be going back to work if they can now itv news political correspondent shehab khan has more on the pm 's comments i think everybody has sort of taken the stay at home if you can i think we should now say well go back to work if you can because i think its very important that people should try to lead their lives more normally boris johnson tells school leavers their sacrifice helped save thousands of lives leisure performance and beauty lockdown easing in england what will change what will gyms and swimming pools be like when they reopen in england i want to see more people feeling confident to use the shops use the restaurants and get back into work but only if we all follow the guidance he later added that people should only return if their company is obeying the guidelines and it is safe to do so mr johnson also hinted that stricter rules on wearing face coverings could be brought in as we get the numbers down in the way that we have and we really stamp out outbreaks in the way that we are i do think we need to be stricter in insisting people wear face coverings in confined spaces where they are meeting people they do nt normally meet he said in an online question and answer session with the public the pm said the government is looking at ways of making sure that people have face coverings in shops where there is a risk of transmission his comments come as downing street faced questions about why more cabinet ministers are not wearing face coverings after new figures suggested the majority of britons are covering up while in public fresh data from the office for national statistics ons indicated that 52 % of adults in britain had worn a face covering when leaving their home in the final week of june up from 43 % on the week before regardless of whether they had worn a face covering previously 58 % of the 1,788 adults quizzed between july 2 - 5 said they were very or fairly likely to wear one in the next seven days the level of usage provoked further questions for number 10 about why so few of the governments leading figures had been spotted wearing a face covering boris johnson appeared in public wearing a mask on friday tweeting images of himself with the caption if you re out this weekend be sure to follow the guidelines on social distancing while chancellor rishi sunak following his summer economic statement was pictured serving food to customers at a wagamama restaurant in central london without a non - surgical mask government recommendations as part of the one metre plus guidance are that measures such as wearing a face covering should be taken if people indoors can not keep two metres away from each other a spokesman for the prime minister asked about ministers not donning face masks said i do nt spend my time with individual ministers but all the ministers abide by the social distancing guidance which is in place mr sunak has also been pictured greeting people this week by bumping elbows to avoid shaking hands when asked whether such a gesture was according to social distancing rules the pms spokesman said the guidance is clear that you should stay two metres apart where you can if that s not possible it is one metre plus mitigation and that mitigation has been set out in the guidance culture minister caroline dinenage told bbc radio 4 's today programme that she had taken to wearing a face covering all the time and said a lot of her colleagues were doing the same the tory mp last month tweeted a picture of herself wearing a cloth covering to mark face coverings being made mandatory on public transport health secretary matt hancock has been seen wearing a face covering while visiting a hospital while culture secretary oliver dowden also wore one while attending a gallery this week as of friday first minister nicola sturgeon has changed the rules making it obligatory for shoppers to cover their face with a covering or similar garment in scotland when asked whether ministers had considered introducing a similar rule for england ms dinenage told the bbc we have said face coverings in closed spaces is advised but people can use their own discretion but of course we will keep this under review this is a topic upon which scientists tend to have rather different views so we are looking at it as new scientific studies emerge the president of the royal society professor venki ramakrishna has recommended that everyone should wear a face covering in public to reduce the risk of a second wave of covid-19 infections meanwhile london mayor sadiq khan has repeated his call for face coverings to be made compulsory in public telling the pm in a letter that he was disappointed and frustrated that the government had not demanded masks be worn in busy and enclosed public places a spokesman for the pm said a face covering was no substitute for good social distancing practices such as staying two metres away from others gyms and pools to reopen and outdoor performances will return in england has coronavirus changed the fitness industry forever for barnsley 's leader tackling coronavirus has been a lonely battle with cases still much higher than elsewhere sir stephen houghtoneven fears there might be another lockdown as was enforced in leicester but while the government only recently offered details of test results to help the council throughout the pandemic he 's been getting advice and some practical help from an unlikely source in germany every other week sir stephen chats over video link to the mayor of german town schwabisch gmund richard arnold who 's been sharing his coronavirus tackling tips he inspired sir stephen to promote the wearing of face coverings in public in an attempt to slow the spread of coronavirus in his hard hit town this idea of community face coverings i have to say i stole from the germans he told itv news providing hand outs to locals in the town centre at one stage schwabisch gmund even sent over much needed ppe to help when supplies ran low in barnsley german mayor richard arnold on sending ppe to barnsley i asked stephen how i could help the city of schwabisch gmund feels very very close to barnsley mr arnold said we love barnsley we love the people there and the citizens and the council agreed to help immediately and send some of the masks and the ppe they 've also exchanged personalised masks with their cities symbols unlike in germany barnsley still has no app to help fight the disease we went to visit the twin town 's mayor richard arnold to askhe thought they 'd done so much better in reducing cases mr arnold lauded germany 's coronavirus app and questioned why the uk had not worked with european neighbours in order to get one up and running it 's growing people are believing in it now and i think once we 've reached 60 % of the population we could then say we can control when you go outside when you meet people you could mingle in crowds because the app will show you whether there is someone positive or not barnsley and schwabisch gmund leaders discuss the coronavirus app he told me he was surprised there was no testing early on in barnsley he said here we organised the testing and we did this in a way where you go to fast food restaurants we developed this kind of fast track testing so we could test a lot of people who felt not very well germans were also given very strict rules and lots of guidance on how to behave at the start of the pandemic he says he believes that gave them confidence whereas his impression was in britain everything was very confused an uncertain psychologically it was very important but also medically it was very important he added video report by itv news political correspondent paul brand people living in care homes in england will soon be allowed to have loved ones visit them inside their residence so long as the facility has been made covid secure the health secretary has told itv news matt hancock acknowledged people are yearning to see their loved ones and said announcements will be made in the next few days setting out how safe visits can occur there 'll be more details soon but i think that people are yearning to see their loved ones and the residents of care homes get so much from visitors mr hancock told itv news political correspondent paul brand it 's been a very very long period and that period where there has nt been any visiting to care homes that s coming to an end very soon he hinted indoor visits could be permitted from as early as next week very much hope that in the next few days well be able to make this change said it was important for ministers to get it right in order to avoid more transmission in care homes we ve got to make sure it works for each local area but i hope we can make that change very soon full details on care home visits will be set out by the health secretary matt hancock very soon itv news political correspondent paul brand explains the health secretary also dropped a big hint that a pay rise was on the horizon for social care staff he said the social care sector does an incredibly important job and pointed to previous pay rises he has voted for and said he was proud they had been made i ca nt make a financial announcement now but i think you can see where my heart lies he told paul brand its a very important and valued job and i 'm really proud of the increase in the living wage that we ve introduced that has had more of an impact on the care sector than any other sector and i want to see that go further despite providing the sector with some good news mr hancock would not offer an apology to people employed in social care over comments made by boris johnson which appeared to blame the industry for its high numbers of coronavirus cases mr johnson told reporters too many care homes did not properly follow procedures during the coronavirus pandemic one care home boss debbie adams told itv news she was absolutely livid when she heard his comments and said she wants an apology when asked whether he would say sorry to care home managers for the comments made by mr johnson the health secretary declined care home boss calls boris johnson a joke instead he sought to clarify the pm 's comments saying he never meant to blame care homes he added i can also say how much we value their work and everything they ve done to keep people safe in the wide ranging interview which will be available on youtube to watch in full the health secretary said a second peak in coronavirus is not inevitable despite many believing the recent lockdown relaxations will cause one he said well i very much hope there wo nt be one people talk about the second wave as if it 's something that is inevitable we do see spikes we ve seen in australia they thought that they d more or less got rid of it and then there s been a spike and they ve locked down melbourne he admitted the most difficult time is in the winter because people are indoor more and secondly because there s some evidence that the virus transmits more easily in cold environments and so that is undoubtedly going to be a challenge but there s no inevitability to it so long as people keep following the social distancing guidelines he said the darkest moments of the crisis so far was after lockdown had been imposed but no changes could be seen in transmission levels or death levels plus when both he and the prime minister were ill with coronavirus the 15 billion spent on ppe personal protective equipment since march is one of those numbers that once it 's in your head it 's impossible to unthink it like a ghoul from a nightmare it gauges both the scale of the health and economic crisis we 're enduring but also quite how astonishingly unprepared the government really was remember at the beginning the health secretary matt hancock said we had more than adequate stocks of ppe because of no deal planning just for the record the 15bn dispensed on face masks gowns and visors which have a user life of anything from a day to a few weeks would on the government 's sums be enough to pay for at least 18 new hospitals which is not to argue of course that matt hancock should have scrimped on the ppe although for the government to spend quite that much but still have healthcare workers complaining they were unprotected is quite an achievement and will be a focus of the totemic public enquiry as and when).the 15bn for ppe is also just 7 % or so of all the additional spending by the government to protect our health and the economy over the past three and a bit months it 's why with tax revenues collapsing with the collapsing economy the government is set to borrow something like 350bn just in this year as the ft points out equivalent to close to a peacetime record setting 20 % of our national income on the peston show last night i asked the business secretary alok sharma whether borrowing at this rate was sustainable noting that it was more than twice the deficit as a share of national income as what was being borrowed after the 2008 crash and which the tory party at the time regarded as end of the world recklessness alok sharma said what every politician from every mainstream party says namely that the uk would be in the direst of straits if the money had n't been spent and that it is only sensible for the chancellor to keep spending to support an economic recovery and keep unemployment to a minimum who would argue?but there remains a question of whether the consequential rise in the national debt to more than 100 % of national income is sustainable forever and whether some thought should be given to the long term consequences if nothing else there should presumably be a plan to cut the annual increase in borrowing from its vertigo inducing height to something nearer terra firma say a pedestrian 2 % or 3 % of gdp.alok sharma 's point interest rates are at a record low and it has been years since the uk encountered reluctance from investors to provide the cash is the kind of backward looking quest for comfort that i 've encountered far too many times from the bosses of businesses whose foot is on the accelerator to insolvency for the avoidance of doubt the uk is never going bust with our own currency and independent central bank able to create money at will there 's always the remedy of extreme degradation of the currency but i am not sure that is so much of a comfort living in a country whose prosperity is undermined by the cancers of high inflation and high interest rates is best avoided there is comfort to be had though as i mentioned on news at ten a couple of weeks ago in that the bloating of the uk 's official government debt is a phenomenon afflicting every single rich western country the latest projections from the imf for example shows there are plenty of rich competitor countries with bigger debts than the uk 's 102 % of gdp on the imf 's projections the debts of spain and france are 25 percentage points higher and italy 's more than 60 percentage points higher even the debts of germany canada and the us are greater by the fiscal equivalent of a sneeze a few percentage points and 40 percentage points respectively to put it another way if the borrowing explosion is a crisis it is not a peculiarly british crisis but it is a crisis of the whole west and japan which for decades now has muddled through with massively higher debts).and what flows from that really matters first when international investors are looking to place their funds in a country or are choosing which government 's debt to hold in the ugly contest held for borrowers the uk is by no means the ugliest so even without the bank of england 's voracious appetite for sunak 's paper there is probably an enduring market for uk government bonds second and more importantly if the idea gets round that all high borrowing countries have to retrench any time soon the whole world will be in the deepest darkest doo doo because this year 's global recession will just go on and on and on which means that just like the virus itself the solution to the global economic challenge can not be reached with each country suiting its own peculiar needs and autonomously reversing stimulus in a lethal game of beggar my neighbour what is required is massive perhaps unprecedented global coordination to ease the journey to whatever the new economic normal may look like at this high point of populist nationalism we urgently need the giant penny to drop that putting the world first is the better route to save the nation and that leaders and governments must rediscover the virtues of international co - operation otherwise the virus will send us hurtling back to the gloom and mayhem of the 1930s more lockdown restrictions set to be eased to boost uk economy fears mount over looming

chancellor rishi sunak has announced a raft of measures worth up to 30 billion as part of his plan to rescue the economy in the aftermath of coronavirus notable parts of the plan include the eat out to help out scheme which will see the government offer 50 % off up to 10 per head on meals out on certain days of the week during august mr sunak said he wants to get pubs restaurants cafes and b&bs bustling again as such there is also a reduction in vat from 20 % to 5 % for the next six months on food accommodation and attractions itv news political editor robert peston analyses rishi sunak 's announcement what is a stamp duty holiday and will it work government gives diners 50 % off food in august with eat out to help out plan dosh for nosh all you need to know about sunaks summer mini budget the chancellor said property transactions fell by 50 % in may and to get people buying houses again he announced the stamp duty threshold will be increased from 125,000 to 500,000 until march 31 2021 as part of mr sunak 's plan to boost employment the government will pay 1,000 to employers who bring back staff who have been furloughed and 2 billion has been set out to create hundreds of thousands of jobs for young people with the government set to help pay for six month placements for under-25s facing long term unemployment on green measures the chancellor announced a 2 billion green homes grant to help homeowners and landlords apply for vouchers to make their properties more energy efficient youth employment kickstart scheme outlining the biggest package of support for youth unemployment in decades mr sunak said firms will be encouraged to hire young people on six month work placement schemes with the government paying the majority of wages the government will pay 100 % of the minimum wage for 25 hours per week for young people aged between 16 and 24 who have been hired under the scheme these will be new jobs the chancellor said with the funding conditional on the firm proving these jobs are additional he added these will be decent jobs with a minimum of 25 hours per week paid at least the national minimum wage he said the hope is for the first people to be in their jobs by autumn with an initial 2 billion made available and no cap on the number of places available he also said employers will be paid 1,000 to take on trainees they 'll also be paid to create new apprenticeships for the next six months itv news political correspondent romilly weeks reports on the impact of the announcement on businesses and jobs the chancellor told mps well pay businesses to hire young apprentices with a new payment of 2,000 and well introduce a brand new bonus for businesses to hire apprentices aged 25 and over with a payment of 1,500 mr sunak said an extra 1 billion would be given to the department for work and pensions to support people back into work the jobs retention bonus the jobs retention bonus is designed to save the jobs of workers who have been furloughed since lockdown was announced explaining the scheme mr sunak said if you re an employer and you bring back someone who was furloughed and continuously employ them through to january well pay you a 1,000 bonus per employee some 9.4 billion has been set aside by the treasury to pay for the job retention bonus which is what the cost will be if all 9.4 million furloughed jobs are restored mr sunak said this scheme was being announced to replace the furlough scheme which he said ca n't be open forever the longer people are on furlough the more likely it is their skills could fade and they will find it harder to get new opportunities it is in no ones long term interests for the scheme to continue forever least of all those trapped in a job that can only exist because of government subsidy he said the jobs retention bonus will reward and incentivise employers who bring furloughed staff back eat out to help out and vat reduction mr sunak said the eating out discount was something that has never been tried before in the uk meals eaten at any participating business from monday to wednesday will be 50 % off up to a maximum discount of 10 per head for everyone including children businesses will need to register and can do so through a website which will open on monday each week in august businesses can then claim the money back with the funds in their bank account within five working days the 40-year old said another part of the plan to help get customers back into restaurants cafes and pubs is a reduction in vat so i ve decided for the next six months to cut vat on food accommodation and attractions mr sunak said vat will be reduced from 20 % to 5 % from july 15 until january 12 to help noting this is a 4 billion catalyst for the hospitality and tourism sectors benefiting over 150,000 businesses and consumers everywhere all helping to protect 2.4 million jobs stamp duty reduction the chancellor has announced an increase in stamp duty in order to reinvigorate the housing market after prices fell for the first time in eight years he announced he has decided to cut stamp duty telling the commons right now there is no stamp duty on transactions below 125,000 today i am increasing the threshold to 500,000 this will be a temporary cut running until march 31 2021 and as is always the case these changes to stamp duty will take effect immediately the average stamp duty bill will fall by 4,500 and nearly nine out of 10 people buying a main home this year will pay no stamp duty at all how will the funding be paid for the 30 billion announced in mr sunak 's summer statement means the will have spent at least 160 billion on supporting the economy through coronavirus as the deputy director of the institute for fiscal studies carl emmerson says the huge sums of cash will come from government borrowing he says these measures are likely to push the deficit further above 300 billion though he pointed out how borrowing during coronavirus is at very low interest rates how debts are paid off depends on how the economy bounces back after the crisis mr sunak denied tax rises were inevitable but appeared to concede they are likely those decisions are always for future budgets but the important thing for now is that we act in a way that is bold that is decisive he said he said creating jobs is the best way to make sure we have strong economy the treasury has already warned of the significant fiscal cost to providing support and finance experts are already warning about the huge forthcoming cost to the taxpayer mr sunaks latest round of coronavirus emergency measures adds to the near-160 billion plan already unveiled since march watch rishi sunak deliver his summer statement in full a care home manager whose reaction to boris johnson 's comments on the sector were quoted in the commons has invited the prime minister to come and apologise to staff at her facility debbie adams called the pm a joke"after the prime minister suggested too manycare homesdid not properly follow procedures during the coronavirus pandemic mr johnson has since avoided apologising for his comments despite coming under sustained criticism during prime minister 's question on wednesday speaking to itv news ms adams said i think the prime minister needs to apologise i 'd invite him down to come and apologise to my staff definitely she added he needs to actually try to make right what he said if we go back to the words that he said that we did n't follow procedure really boris johnson the care home manager said the sector adhered to the guidance the government gave them but criticised it for not knowing what the procedure was after mr johnson stopped short of a full apology in the commons ms adams branded the pm very insincere adding my staff are absolutely fuming and i do n't blame them they 've worked very very hard care home manager debbie adams says the pm blamed the care homes ' earlier on wednesday the prime minister dodged requests from labour leader sir keir starmer to backtrack on his criticism of the social care system sir keir said on monday when asked why care home deaths had been so high the prime minister said and i quote too many care homes did nt really follow the procedures in the way that they could have that has caused huge offence to frontline care workers it has now been 48 hours will the prime minister apologise to care workers mr johnson provided a carefully worded response to sir keir but stopped short of saying sorry for his remarks the last thing i wanted to do is to blame care workers for what has happened or for any of them to think that i was blaming them because they ve worked hard incredibly hard throughout this crisis looking after some of the most vulnerable people in our country and doing an outstanding job mr johnson replied and as he knows tragically 257 of them have lost their lives and when it comes to taking blame i take full responsibility for what has happened mr johnson was pushed by sir keir to reverse his comments about those working in a sector which has undergone a tough time during the pandemic sir keir added by refusing to apologise the prime minister rubs salt into the wounds of the very people that he stood at his front door and clapped the prime minister and the health secretary must be the only people left in the country who think they put a protective ring around care homes those on the front line know that was nt the case after sir keir quoted a frustrated care home manager interview by itv news mr johnson told the commons that the government appreciates the incredible work of care home workers before pledging to reform the sector a joke watch care home manager debbie adams ' reaction to boris johnson 's comments the prime minister said he hoped it would be on a cross - party basis to which sir keir agreed although noted his government has been in power for 10 years with no plan no white paper of course well join in plans for reforming social care but 10 years wasted sir keir starmer said more than 19,000 care home residents have died from covid-19 adding overall around one in 20 care home residents are estimated to have died from the virus its chilling these are extraordinary numbers but the prime minister has consistently ducked responsibility for this will he accept it is nt care workers who are to blame its his government boris johnson accused the labour leader of reading out pre - prepared questions adding i ve made it clear this government takes responsibility for everything that we ve done throughout this crisis sir keir said the pm continues to insult those on the frontline by not taking these issues seriously before adding huge mistakes have been made he went on the decision to discharge 25,000 people to care homes without tests was clearly a mistake will the prime minister simply accept his government was just too slow to act on care homes mr johnson said the understanding of the disease changed dramatically over recent months and defended the governments action plan in other matters raised labours anna mcmorrin questioned the pm on the issue of modern slavery in fast fashion clothing factories ms mcmorrin said i am shocked and angered at workers in uk clothing factories like boohoo being paid a mere 3.50 an hour and being forced to work in totally unacceptable conditions in the 21st century there must be no room for exploitation and modern slavery we must call time on fast fashion for the sake of people and our planet so my question is simple what will the prime minister do about it mr johnson replied first of all it is this conservative government that set up laws against modern slavery its this conservative government that massively increased the living wage not only instituted the living wage but massively increased it and we would hope that it would be the labour mayor of leicester who would stand up for the interest of the workforce in his community and that s what we will do will rishi sunak exorcise the ghoul of looming mass unemployment why these are the critical days for boris johnson 's government boris johnson branded a joke for clumsy care home comments chancellor rishi sunak has unveiled his 30 billion mini - budget to kickstart the economy and protect jobs in what he said was a plan designed to get the country through the economic crisis triggered by the covid-19 pandemic numerous investments were announced from a cut to stamp duty and cheaper meals out heres what we learned the scale of the economic hit could potentially be very large indeed the chancellor said the economy had shrunk by 25 % in two months as a result of the lockdown the same amount it grew in the previous 18 years the office for budget responsibility and the bank of england have both warned of significant job losses as a result the cost of measures to protect jobs and businesses could rise to 30 billion up to 9.4 billion is available to pay firms 1,000 bonuses for each furloughed worker kept on some 3.7 billion is available for the kickstart scheme for 16 to 24-year olds and measures to boost skills and apprenticeships under this plan the government will directly pay employers to create decent new jobs for any 16 to 24-year old at risk of long term unemployment mr sunak said employers will need to provide training and support to find a permanent job and in return the government will pay the young peoples wages for six months the cost of slashing vat from 20 % to 5 % from july 15 to january 12 on food accommodation and attractions could be 4.1 billion while up to 500 million is available under the eat out to help out scheme offering diners a discount in august infrastructure spending announced by boris johnson last month adds 5.6 billion while green measures add 3.1 billion the temporary stamp duty cut in england and northern ireland could cost the exchequer 3.8 billion despite all the spending pledges mr sunak did not announce any new revenue raising measures so the new spending will add to the amount the government has been borrowing during the pandemic and pressure is likely to mount on the chancellor to set out how it is all going to be paid for in his next big set piece the autumn statement mr sunak will not let a good crisis go to waste the chancellor said the governments response is a question of values not just economics telling mps it is an unambiguous choice to make this moment meaningful for our country in a way that transcends the frustration and loss of recent months it is a plan to turn our national recovery into millions of stories of personal renewal the chancellor is a bigger draw than the prime minister it may be due to the scale of the economic crisis or a reflection on mr sunaks rising status but the commons was as packed as social distancing rules allowed it was the best attended event in the chamber since the lockdown began with a number of mps using the galleries above the green benches to be able to hear directly from the chancellor people are being encouraged to eat out despite the prime ministers drive to get the nation fit in august meals eaten at any participating business from monday to wednesday will be 50 % off up to a maximum discount of 10 per head for everyone including children mr johnson has said the uk is significantly fatter than most other european countries and we will be happier and fitter and more resistant to diseases like covid if we can tackle obesity half price meals and reduced vat part of sunak plan to save economy from covid-19 what is a stamp duty holiday and how will it work dosh for nosh all you need to know about sunaks summer mini - budget rishi sunak unveiled a plan for jobs in a 30 billion mini - budget he said was designed

think tank is urging the cabinet minister to further loosen the purse strings having already announced a string of bailouts and wage subsidy and emergency loan schemes since the outbreak started and announce a fiscal package worth 10 % of gdp it said such large scale support is required to turnaround what it claims could be the biggest shrinking of britains economy in a century with the foundation claiming a fall of 9.3 % is likely and with the stimulus tools utilised by the last labour government during the global economic crash including cutting interest rates by 5 % not available to the tory administration the think tank is urging the treasury to splurge in order to avert long term job losses and revive the countrys fortunes james smith research director at the resolution foundation said the covid induced economic crisis is like no other crisis we ve seen and with interest rates already at record lows the chancellor will need to take the lead in delivering an ambitious policy response to secure britains economic recovery the measures the chancellor announces in his mini - budget tomorrow need to be big enough to reflect the size of the crisis we face targeted at the sectors that need the most support and flexible enough to cope with the uncertainties that lie ahead a 200 billion fiscal stimulus should therefore focus on protecting jobs and supporting spending in hard hit sectors of the economy and reflect the fact that low income households have found it far hardest to cope the think tanks ideas for shoring up jobs is laid out in its report easing does it

economic hit the foundation recommends that a stimulus package delivered over two years should include a 17 billion per year job support package which would see the furlough scheme extended and job guarantees for young people a 30 billion high street voucher scheme is also recommended the report authors said vouchers worth 500 per adult and 250 per child could be handed out to be spent in hard hit sectors of the economy such as face to face retail hospitality and leisure universal credit should also be boosted by 10 billion to support low income families according to the report meanwhile

khashoggi and 25 russian nationals involved in the mistreatment and death of lawyer sergei magnitsky the foreign secretary said the uk was seeking to hold to account the perpetrators of the worst human rights abuses with a powerful new sanctions regime set up to replace measures taken by the eu when britain was a member the individuals and organisations are the first wave of designations under the new regime with further sanctions expected in the coming months others sanctioned include two high ranking myanmar military generals involved in the systematic and brutal violence against the rohingya people and other ethnic minorities north korea is also being targeted with sanctions imposed on two organisations involved in the forced labour torture and murder that takes place in secretive nation 's gulags the new powers will enable us to impose travel bans and asset freezes against those involved in serious human rights violations dominic raab said the foreign secretary warned if you re a kleptocrat or an organised criminal you will not be able to launder your blood money in this country he said the sanctions aim to send a very clear message on behalf of the british people those with blood on their hands the thugs of despots the henchmen of dictators will not be free to waltz into this country to buy up property on the kings road to do their christmas shopping in knightsbridge or frankly to siphon dirty money through british banks or other financial institutions the new powers will enable the uk to sanction those involved in the violation of human rights including the right to life the right not to be subjected to torture or cruel inhumane degrading treatment or punishmentand the right to be free from slavery servitude or forced or compulsory labour mr raab said this is a demonstration of global britains commitment to acting as a force for good in the world britain has often moved with either the eu or un when sanctions have been imposed in the past but is imposing its own human rights sanctions for the first time ever due to leaving the european union the uks autonomous sanctions regime is set to be brought into force on monday mr raab said from today the uk will have new powers to stop those involved in serious human rights abuses and violations from entering the uk channelling money through our banks and profiting from our economy this is a clear example of how the uk will help to lead the world in standing up for human rights we will not let those who seek to inflict pain and destroy the lives of innocent victims benefit from what

said the new powers are designed to allow individuals to be targeted without punishing the wider people of a country that may be affected the foreign office says the new powers will allow britain to work independently with allies such as the us canada australia and the european union an fco spokesperson said the regime will allow the uk to target individuals and organisations around the world

coronavirus pandemic the culture secretary has admitted despite setting out a 1.57 billion support package designed to protect the sector oliver dowden said the vast majority of the uk 's world beating arts industry will be rescued including venues known as britain 's crown jewels but admitted the package is not going to be able to support everyone sadly not everyones going to be able to survive and not every job is going to be protected and sadly ill have to be honest with you of course well see further redundancies he said during a visit to william shakespeare 's globe theatre while he said protecting the crown jewels was a priority he said he also hopes to save local venues whether that is the theatre or the gallery which are often the only place people can go to to access culture leaders in the industry have mostly welcomed the government support made up of grants and loans which was unveiled by chancellor rishi sunak on sunday evening mr dowden said the package had been set out to help businesses weather the storm caused by the covid-19 pandemic arts are the cultural beating heart of our nation from shakespeare to ed sheeran they enrich our lives but also they make us an economic powerhouse creative industries we are a world leader in all of them he said he said priority will be given to the uk 's crown jewels so institutions which are nationally and internationally renowned boris johnson said the government is working on a plan to reopen theatres as much as safety measures could allow i totally understand the frustration of people in the theatre world the prime minister said they re huge for the uk and they re one of the most amazing things about this country he said he wants to set out next week a timetable for when theatres and other sectors can get back to normal as much as possible there will have to be some creativity in becoming covid secure in the theatre for all sorts of reasons he added but we can do it and we are working very hard now with the theatre sector to get that done so that they can reopen in due course the tate the science museum group the natural history museum national gallery and the royal shakespeare company were among those who welcomed the money meanwhile digital culture media and sport committee chair julian knight said the support package would take some cultural institutions out of the danger zone however he said more was needed to secure the sectors future including possible tax breaks mr dowden said cash will also be awarded to institutions across the uk not just in london he said if you ve only got one gallery in your local area or a theatre its that much more important so its really important that we help those institutions to stay in place labour shadow dcms secretary jo stevens told bbc radio 4s westminster hour that although the funding is a much needed relief for the industry for some it is already too late i do wonder what took the government so long she said they have known the problems in the sector for weeks and weeks and weeks and for some areas and some organisations and theatres across the country from north to south its already too late jobs have gone so the big things will be how quickly its going to get to people and how is it going to be spread around the country in towns and small cities where arts and culture venues are so valuable to local economies the funding was well received by composer lord lloyd webber who said the news was truly welcome at a time when so many theatres orchestras entertainment venues and other arts organisations face such a bleak future however not everyone in the industry reacted so positively to the announcement after playwright shelley silas tweeted she did not believe the tories had properly listened to the industrys lobbying fellow playwright jack thorne responded i disagree and i know there ll be those who believe we should never praise them and of course it wo nt be enough money but i think they have listened and acted and i think we should say thank you wo nt change how i feel about the vast majority of their politics obviously ms silas followed up by writing she would be interested to see a breakdown of how the funding will be divided up tweeting happy for you to disagree jack i d be interested to see a breakdown of where and which buildings / organisations the grants / loans go to hope the nuffield can be saved prob too late comedian and tv presenter jason manford kept his thoughts to a simple thank you guidance for a phased return of the performing arts sectors is expected to be published by the government shortly the package comes after some theatres which are not yet able to stage live performances closed down making staff redundant amid the pandemic museums have also said they face an uncertain future while 1,500 artists and acts signed a letter to culture secretary oliver dowden calling for a road map for the live music industry the government said the money represents the biggest ever one off investment in uk culture and will help struggling institutions stay afloat while their doors are closed 1.5 billion pledged to rescue museums galleries and theatres how the arts industry is suffering in lockdown theatre to be wrapped in colourful barrier tape as it remains closed the government is considering whether to ban huawei from the uk after sanctions imposed by the us raised questions over the firm 's security the culture secretary has said oliver dowden said he has received a national cyber security centre ncsc report on the chinese technology firm and will be discussing it with boris johnson the prime minister had previously made a controversial move to permit huawei 's involvement in the uk 's 5 g network but mr dowden says his boss 's decision is not fixed in stone by july 22 a decision will have been announced on whether to rescind the firm 's access downing street has promised everything you need to know about huawei / uk agreement greece to allow uk flights from july 15 the chinese ambassador to the uk liu xiaoming told reporters any move to ban huawei would send out a very bad message to other chinese businesses he said we want to be your friend we want to be your partner but if you want to make china a hostile country you will have to bear the consequences mr johnson has been under enduring pressure from his own backbenches to halt the companys involvement over concerns that it presents a security risk mr dowden said the ncsc had reviewed the impact of the sanctions announced by the us in may in a bid by donald trumps administration to cut the firm off from international semiconductor supplies he told itv news he and the prime minister were considering analysis provided by the ncsc and said a decision would be announced in parliament mr johnsons move to allow huawei a role set the government at odds with the us which had repeatedly warned against the firm amid clashes with china the us imposed sanctions on the firm to deter countries from using their technology huawei vice president victor zhang said the consequences of the sanctions were as yet unclear we are working closely with our customers to find ways of managing the proposed us restrictions so the uk can maintain its current lead in 5g. as ever we remain open to discussions with the government he said we believe it is too early to determine the impact of the proposed restrictions which are not about security but about market position after campaigning that has intensified over the past few weeks the government has announced a 1.57 billion rescue package for culture arts and heritage organisations in britain including theatres independent cinemas museums and the live music sector with warnings that without more government support around 70 % of theatres were facing closure by christmas the package includes a mixture of loans and grants and is been billed as the biggest ever one off investment in uk culture in a statement culture secretary oliver dowden said i understand the grave challenges the arts face and we must protect and preserve all we can for future generations i said we would not let the arts down and this massive investment shows our level of commitment while the funding is aimed at keeping organisations afloat the government says it is continuing to work on guidance for a phased return of the performing arts sector meanwhile with the details yet to come on how the funds will be shared out the boss of one theatre which is facing possible redundancies of more than 100 said he hoped regional cities would also be recognised stephen crocker from the theatre royal norwich said while he was hugely grateful to the government theatres still need a detailed reopening plan for their long term survival the announcement has been welcomed by the chair of the arts council sir nicholas serota who in a statement described the funding as a very significant investment by the government in the future of arts and culture in this country bosses at the royal shakespeare company said they were pleased and relieved at the news of the funding lord andrew lloyd webber said the news is truly welcome at a time when so many theatres orchestras entertainment venues and other arts organisations face such a bleak future will this save theatres and music venues from closing political correspondent daniel hewitt

of june to attend a political rally in support of donald trump mr farage was pictured in the us on june 20 making saturday 's pub visit an apparent breach of the full 14-day self isolation period required for overseas travellers according to the uk government 's coronavirus restrictions travellers arriving from the us must self isolate for a full 14-days upon their return the apparent breach has prompted angry reactions on social media and prompted calls for an investigation into mr farage 's actions trump rally flops in oklahoma but do n't count him out yet queues for pubs and hairdressers as lockdown restrictions ease on super saturday acting liberal democrat leader sir ed davey has written to kent police asking them to investigate the former mep for violation of the quarantine he wrote there are clearly serious questions to answer for nigel farage adding it is a responsibility of everyone to take the lockdown requirements seriously in order to stop the spread of the virus by choosing to go to the pub when he should have been staying at home mr farage is showing a flagrant disregard for the safety of people in his community a spokesman for mr farage denied the 56-year old had broken quarantine rules by going to the pub while mr farage later tweeted another image from the pub writing to all those screaming and shouting about me going to the pub i have been back from the usa for 2 weeks and i have been tested the result was negative sorry to disappoint you cheers pubs and restaurants across england have reopened their doors for the first time in four months as lockdown measures in the country eased on what has been billed as super saturday nigel farage parts company with broadcaster lbc after comparing black lives matter to the taliban portugal 's foreign affairs minister has branded the uk 's quarantine plans for its citizens as absurd claiming britain has 28 times more deaths a tweet was posted from augusto santos silva 's official twitter account after the uk published a list of 73 countries and territories from which people can arrive on british soil without a mandatory 14-day period of quarantine several of the uk 's european neighbours were on the list including spain france italy and greece but portugal was not on the list revealed the full list of countries exempt from quarantine on return for english travellers it means anyone arriving in the uk from the country must isolate for 14 days a translation of the portuguese tweet reads it is absurd that a country the united kingdom which has 28 times more deaths than portugal due to # covid19 imposes quarantine on passengers from portugal portugese media has quoted mr santos silva as saying he hopes the british government corrects its decision very soon other countries absent from the list include the us china and thailand approved destinations pose a reduced risk to the public health of uk citizens but the list will be kept under constant review the department for transport said it means people who depart on saturday and spend at least six days in one of the listed locations will not need to self isolate on their return prime minister boris johnson has urged the public to not blow it this weekend when pubs reopen in england and said he hopes people behave responsibly amid the continuing coronavirus pandemic in an interview with lbc 's nick ferrari mr johnson said britain is in good shape in its fight against covid-19 but said people must enjoy summer sensibly and continue sticking to guidelines but he has refused to condemn his father stanley for apparently breaching lockdown rules with his recent trip to greece despite urging the public to be sensible ahead of the reopening of the hospitality industry this weekend the prime minister when prompted refused to criticise his father for flying to athens a move described by many on social media as a blatant lockdown breach the 79-year old johnson arrived in the capital city on wednesday evening to visit his mountain villa after flying via bulgaria in order to bypass greece 's ban on arrivals from the uk when asked by lbc 's nick ferrari what he 'd say to his dad the prime minister said i think you really ought to raise that with him when pressed he continued to dodge the question instead saying he was not going to get into details of family conversations following the comment twitter was littered with furious users writing one rule for us and another rule for them it follows the prime minister 's stringent defence of his chief aide dominic cummings over his trip to durham during the height of lockdown mr johnson said he really understands people 's feelings regarding mr cummings ' 260-mile journey but would not go so far when speaking about his father when asked for one comment on his dad 's trip mr johnson said i think the overwhelming majority of the british people have understood what needs to be done and have been very prudent and that is the right thing to do he says people should continue following the rules as lockdown eases the prime minister wants people to go out this weekend in order to help restart the uk 's stalled economy with many businesses within the hospitality industry set to open on saturday the prime minister will tell a downing street press conference this evening that people should not overdo it when they hit pubs for the first time in months he will say later anyone who flouts social distancing and covid secure rules is not only putting us all at risk but letting down those businesses and workers who have done so much to prepare for this new normal tomorrow saturday is about supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months boris johnson to warn the public not to overdo it when pubs reopen in england holidaymakers in england given green light to travel abroad from saturday but he will add we are not out of the woods yet all these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their

responsibly we must not let them down the virus is still with us and the spike in leicester has shown that if it starts running out of control again the government will not hesitate in putting on the brakes and re - imposing restrictions video report by itv news political correspondent shehab khan the first ministers of scotland and wales have criticised the uk government 's shambolic handling of quarantine rules for travellers returning to the country in a scathing criticism of number 10 's handling of proposals to lift quarantine restrictions at the border both nicola sturgeon and mark drakeford said communication had been lacking ms sturgeon said her government would not be dragged along in the wake of another governments to be quite frank shambolic decision making process while mr drakeford described dealing with boris johnson 's government on the matter as an utterly shambolic experience it follows the scrapping of the 14-day self isolation policy for people returning to or visiting england from certain destinations under the changed proposals travellers returning from countries such as spain france italy and germany will no longer need to self isolate for two weeks mark drakeford blasts uk government for utterly shambolic ' decisions over quarantine rules pms father stanley johnson criticised for greece trip amid pandemic holidaymakers in england given green light to travel abroad from saturday when asked about the changes mr drakeford told a press conference in cardiff if ever there was an example of making an announcement first and then trying to work out what you meant by it that is what we have seen since this announcement was first trailed in the press and day after day we have attempted to get a sensible answer from the uk government on how they intend to make these changes i just have to say its been an impossible experience to follow mr drakeford added that he has lost track of the number of weeks that have gone by since he last had direct contact with mr johnson he added however that the way the issue of air bridges had been handled was the exception and not the rule in terms of relations with the uk government striking a similar note ms sturgeon said it had been really quite challenging for scotland to come to a position on uk government proposals on lifting quarantine restrictions she said there were difficult and complex decisions to be made speaking at the scottish government 's daily coronavirus briefing she added just to illustrate the point on the shifting sands of the uk government 's position the list of countries that they were yesterday demandingthat the scottish government sign up to and suggesting we were a barrier to getting an agreement on is not the same as the list they have shared with us today ms sturgeon said it was now likely very likely that her government would be able to agree the list of countries the uk has categorised as low risk but added we will need to do a proper assessment of that speaking on friday morning transport secretary grant shapps told itv that the government had been really careful and cautious in bringing in exemptions to the quarantine rule in response to the criticisms made by both first ministers a uk government spokesperson said we have been working with all devolved administrations on quarantine from the outset and we will continue to do so it is for the devolved administrations to make and explain their own decisions and the measures they 're putting in place it concluded air passengers arriving in airports in england should ensure that they follow the guidance from the relevant devolved administrations in the area where they live what are air bridges and which holiday destinations could be included coronavirus uk holidaymakers left in the dark over quarantine free travel boris johnson has indicated he would not take the knee in solidarity with the black lives matter movement and said he does not believe people should be bullied into joining in the prime minister said i do n't believe in gestures when asked whether he would take the knee in an interview with lbc he admitted he can do more to better represent minorities at the top of government but said he does not think people should be bullied into making gestures such as the one synonymous with the black lives matter movement i do nt believe in gestures i believe in substance he told lbc 's nick ferrari when asked would you take the knee racist fish spray painted on denmark 's little mermaid man arrested over toppling of edward colston statue in bristol he went on i do nt want people to be bullied into doing things they do nt necessarily want to do if you think of what happened with those officers standing at the cenotaph they were being insulted in quite aggressive terms by members of the crowd and told to take the knee some of them did and it was very difficult for the others who did nt that s my position following his comments black labour mp david lammy questioned the prime minister 's stance that he does not believe in gestures he wrote on twitter says the man who brandished a smoked kipper on stage in the tory leadership hustings which led to him becoming prime minister mr johnson 's comments follow those of the foreign secretary who recently said he would only take the knee for two people the queen and the missus when i asked her to marry me dominic raab said he believed the stance originated in tv series game of thrones adding it feels to me like a symbol of subjugation and subordination rather than one of liberation and emancipation while government ministers have distanced themselves from stance labour leader sir keir starmer has done the opposite by posing for a photo while taking the knee he posted a photograph in early june of himself and deputy labour leader angela rayner of them both taking the knee he wrote we kneel with all those opposing anti - black racism boris johnson will urge the public not to overdo it when pubs and restaurants reopen in a warning that the health of the economy is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly the prime minister will lead a downing street press conference ahead of the easing of the lockdown in england on saturday which will be a major test for keeping coronavirus transmission down he is expected to impel people to act safely or run the risk of the government putting on the brakes and bringing back severe restrictions as has been witnessed in leicester the lockdown imposed on march 23 suppressed covid-19s spread by drastically reducing the peoples contacts but the reopening of the economy will be a tense moment in the battle speaking on friday mr johnson is expected to paint the easing in england as a means of supporting the livelihoods of bosses and their employees but warn we are not out of the woods yet they are our local restaurants hairdressers libraries museums cinemas and yes pubs they are also hotels b&bs indeed much of our tourism industry he will say according to an extract released to the media ahead of the speech all these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe but the success of these businesses the livelihoods of those who rely on them and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly we must not let them down the virus is still with us and the spike in leicester has shown that if it starts running out of control again the government will not hesitate in putting on the brakes and re - imposing restrictions anyone who flouts social distancing and covid secure rules is not only putting us all at risk but letting down those businesses and workers who have done so much to prepare for this new normal on friday the prime ministers official spokesman said mr johnson will be warning people not to overdo it asked if mr johnson would be visiting a pub or restaurant on saturday the spokesman said he s talked about his enthusiasm for a haircut and pint previously but i do nt know exactly what he s doing on saturday yet the spokesman added that it would be plain for all to see next week what he s been doing at the weekend if he gets his blonde mop trimmed over the weekend it comes after the treasury was forced to delete a tweet from its official account on wednesday evening urging people to grab a drink and raise a glass pubs are reopening their doors from 4 july the department was accused of sending the most tone deaf tweet in history by journalist piers morgan who said 65k people dead the economy catering millions facing unemployment and the treasury wants us all to go out on the p & celebrate a treasury

but essential international travel the 79-year old arrived in athens on wednesday evening to visit his mountain villa and shared a video of his plane landing in the capital on social media platform instagram he also posted a picture of himself wearing a face mask which appeared to be taken in an airport mr johnson flew to athens via bulgaria the daily mail said because the greek government has banned direct flights from the uk until mid - july he told the paper he was visiting the country on essential business trying to covid proof my property in view of the upcoming letting season i need to set up distancing measures at the property because they re taking it very seriously here the greeks are trying to stop bulk arrivals from the uk but they were quite happy to have me coming in all they wanted to know was where i was coming from and what i was doing then i had my temperature taken and was swabbed twice mr johnson said air bridges must be set up as soon as possible adding from what i ve seen the arrival of the british will not be a danger to the greeks because they re so careful here but his trip has angered mps with shadow minister rosena allin khan tweeting most people have been following the guidelines and socially distancing not everyone will get a holiday this year those closest to the prime minister have different rules though labour mp kate osborne said dominic cummings broke the lockdown rules now its @borisjohnsons father one rule for the elite and another for everyone else it seems they re laughing directly in the face of people up and down this country shame and labours neil coyle tweeted junior johnson axes freedom of movement undermining rights for 60 million brits senior johnson sneaks to his greek villa during a global pandemic liberal democrat alistair carmichael said this is simply further evidence that when it comes to following the rules it is one rule for the conservatives and one rule for everyone else whilst the prime minister is continuing to ask people to make huge sacrifices especially the people of leicester he must reflect on how much of a kick in the teeth these reports will be the foreign office currently advises british nationals against all but essential international travel because of the coronavirus pandemic the prime ministers official spokesman confirmed that the foreign office advice remains in place but said it is for individuals to make the judgments themselves it could have gone either way boris johnson thanks nhs staff after coronavirus recovery what you can and ca n't do in england as lockdown eases from july 4 video report by itv news political correspondent paul brand boris johnson has pledged to extend the right of hong kong citizens to live and work in the uk after accusing china of a clear and serious breach of a treaty with britain the prime minister on wednesday accused beijing of violating the former british colonys degree of autonomy by imposing a much criticised national security law on the territory he told mps he would introduce a new route for those with british national overseas status to live and work in the uk and apply for citizenship which could potentially extend the right for nearly three million people mr johnson followed foreign secretary dominic raab in accusing china of breaching the treaty that aimed to smooth the transition when the territory was handed back to china in 1997 asia correspondent debi edward gives an update from beijing during prime ministers questions mr johnson told the commons the enactment and imposition of this national security law constitutes a clear and serious breach of the sino british joint declaration it violates hong kongs high degree of autonomy and is in direct conflict with hong kong basic law we made clear that if china continues down this path we would introduce a new route for those with british national overseas status to enter the uk granting them limited leave to remain with the ability to live and work in the uk and thereafter to apply for citizenship and that is precisely what we will do foreign secretary dominic raab has accused china of a clear and serious violation of a treaty forged with the uk by imposing national security legislation on hong kong the cabinet member said the uk will honour its commitment to citizens of the former british colony which could extend the right for nearly three million hong kongers to come to the uk mr raab on wednesday said beijing had breached the joint declaration signed between the uk and china to protect freedoms in the territory by enacting the controversial legislation hong kong police use water canon on defiant protesters hong kong protests what does one country two systems ' mean his statement came after hong kong police made their first arrests under the law including one person said to have displayed a sign with the union jack and calling for hong kongs independence taking effect on tuesday night the law makes activities deemed subversive or secessionist punishable by imprisonment it is seen as targeting the anti - government demonstrations in a statement outside the foreign office mr raab told reporters the uk had carefully assessed the legislation since its publication on tuesday night it constitutes a clear violation of the autonomy of hong kong and a direct threat to the freedoms of its people and therefore i m afraid to say it is a clear and serious violation of the joint declaration the treaty between the united kingdom and china he said video report by itv news asia correspondent debi edward the foreign office has summoned the chinese ambassador to make clear the uk 's concern over the new hong kong national security law liu xiaoming was called to a meeting where the foreign office 's permanent secretary sir simon mcdonald said the imposition of the legislation breaches the sino british joint declaration the meeting comes just hours afterchinaimposed the legislation on the city the national security law targets secession subversion terrorism and colluding with foreign forces with punishments up to life in prison sir simon made clear the uk 's deep concern over the new law which came into effect inhong kongon monday without the details being published first foreign secretary dominic raab said if beijing tried to stop people with british national overseas status from leaving hong kong there would be little that could be done by the uk he told itvs peston programme ultimately if they follow through on something like that there would be little that we could do to coercively force them acts of vandalism against government facilities or public transport can be prosecuted as subversion or terrorism while anyone taking part in activities deemed as secessionist would also be in violation of the new law the law directly targets some of the actions of anti - government protesters last year which included attacks on government offices and police stations damage to subway stations and the shutdown of the citys international airport chris patten chinese government is behaving in aggressive and loutish ' way boris johnson deeply concerned about china 's approval of national security law for hong kong the new national security law further blurs the distinction between the legal systems of semi - autonomous hong kong which maintained aspects of british law after the 1997 handover and the mainlands authoritarian communist party system mr raab continued there is an issue around freedom and human rights in hong kong and there is an issue around china keeping its word on an international obligation it made to the united kingdom back in 1984 itv news asia correspondent debi edward explains how china is likely to react to britain 's offer to the people of hong kong i would nt want to be naive about this i think we need to be realistic but i do think that china as a rising leading member of the international community is sensitive to the reputational risk in all of this but clearly not sufficiently that it has nt proceeded anyway there is diplomatic leverage there are other ways that we can persuade china not to fully implement either the national security law or some of the reprisals you talk about but ultimately we need to be honest that we would nt be able to force china to allow bn(o)s to come to the uk hong kongs leader has strongly endorsed the new security lawchinascentral government is imposing on the semi - autonomous territory in her speech marking the anniversary of its handover from colonial britain this decision was necessary and timely to maintain hong kongs stability carrie lam said boris johnson said on tuesday the uk government is deeply concerned by the legislation adding we will be setting out our response in due course a pro - democracy political party the league of social democrats organised a protest march during the flag raising ceremony preceding ms lams speech participants chanted slogans echoing demands from protesters last year for political reform and an investigation into alleged police abuses president xi jinping signed a presidential order making the law take effect after its approval by the standing committee of the national peoples congress chinas rubber stamp legislature and it has been added to the basic law hong kongs constitution hong kong 's last british governor has told itv news china 's passing of a new national security law puts an end to the one country two systems framework which was agreed when the territory was handed back to beijing 23 years ago chris patten watched as the union flag was lowered over the former colony on july 1 1997 following more than 150 years of british rule as part of the handover beijingsigned an agreement lodged at the un to respect hong kong 's autonomy and all that came with it freedom of speech assembly and an independent judiciary for 50 years but in an interview with itv news lord patten told itv news correspondent ivor bennett the new legislation which criminalises sedition and subversive activities will drive a coach and horses through that agreement and will put in danger the civil liberties it was supposed to uphold if hong kong is damaged it 's because ofxi jinping he said before accusing china 's current leader of turning the screw on hong kong hong kong 's tiananmen square vigil does n't just defy a ban it challenges china 's rule the death of hong kong ' shows emboldened chinese president will not tolerate trouble three quarters of people polled believe there will be a second coronavirus lockdown in 2020 a new survey for itv 's peston has revealed and the majority would blame the public for a second wave of those polled almost half 48 % said they expected a second spike in the virus to hit in winter leading to another nationwide lockdown with 87 % believing there will be serious damage to the economy while six in ten people thought there would be further disorder on britain 's streets in the next six months and despite pubs and restaurants in england being allowed to open from saturday 70 % of those polled think they will have to close again later in the year the poll of 2,000 people by jl partners found that six in ten said they would blame a second wave on the public for flouting lockdown rules the majority of parents believe children will be able to return to school by september this comes ahead of an expected announcement by education secretary gavin williamson on thursday that will set out the governments road map to get children back in the classroom of those parents polled 64 % said the plans was achievable while 14 % said it was unlikely to happen according to the exclusive survey for itv s peston only one in seven 13 % think they will go on a holiday abroad this summer with 32 percent saying they expect to take a uk ' staycation speaking on itvs peston foreign secretary dominic raab said local flare ups would be mitigated if people followed the guidance which would allow the country to get back to some sort of normality the foreign secretary was also asked about the situation in hong kong on the day a controversial security law was enforced bychina the government have offered up to three million hong kong residents the chance to settle in the uk and ultimately apply for citizenship but mr raab admitted there was little the british government could do ifchina tried to block hong kong chinese people from coming to the uk well there 's of course all of the international diplomacy that we 're engaged in but ultimately if they follow through on something like that there would be little that we could do to force them to coercively force them the foreign secretary told itv news political editor robert peston but he said he believed china was sensitive to the damage it 's doing to its reputation i would n't want to be naive about this i think we need to be realistic but i do think china as a rising leading member of the international community is sensitive to the reputational risk in all of this but clearly not sufficiently that it has n't proceeded anyway he said it was difficult to give precise forecasts as to how many people of hong kong would take up the offer to come to the uk we think that the majority of people would probably either hunker down in hong kong and others would move to other countries in the region but for us it 's a point of principle we want to live up to our commitments to the people of hong kong and whilst china has failed to live up to its responsibilities in relation to the autonomy and the freedoms of the people of hong kong we will stick by ours hong kong 's tiananmen square vigil does n't just defy a ban it challenges china 's rule the death of hong kong ' shows emboldened chinese president will not tolerate trouble embattled housing secretary robert jenrick has been given less than a week to provide the housing committee with answers to 26 questions relating to his controversial decision to approve a development application made by tory donor richard desmond he 's been embroiled in controversy for weeks after it was revealed he approved the 1,500-home westferry printworks scheme in east london after sitting next to its multimillionaire mastermind at a tory fundraising event two weeks after sitting next to the senior minister former daily express owner mr desmond donated 12,000 to the tories and it was recently revealed the timing of mr jenrick 's decision saved the developer millions of pounds mr jenrick published a 129 page document revealing correspondence between himself and mr desmond leading the prime minister and cabinet members to insist the matter is closed the housing communities and local government committee said it respectfully disagrees with the prime minister and its chair has sent a letter to mr jenrick with a further 26 questions about his decision based on the published documents asking for a reply by 6 july pm has full confidence in jenrick over cash for favours ' row as starmer calls for investigation westferry printworks key questions about approval for controversial development the chummy text messages and letters showed mr jenrick was insistent the controversial development scheme was pushed through before a new tax levy came into force which would cost the developer millions of pounds clive betts chair of the committee which scrutinises mr jenrick 's department in the letter to mr jenrick said the documents clearly do demonstrate that serious mistakes were made he was he was not accusing the minister of deliberate wrongdoing but said the documents have created a strong perception of bias the documents released last wednesday eveningshowed mr desmond had urged the minister to approve the development scheme before a new levy came into so that marxists did not get doe for nothing mr jenrick overruled planning inspectors to sign off the development application but later had to quash his own approval conceding that the decision was unlawful due to apparent bias the government has resisted calls for an inquiry into the issue and has repeatedly insisted the matter is closed in his letter to mr jenrick mr betts wrote the committee respectfully disagrees with the prime ministers assertion that the matter is closed and believes that there are important lessons that must be learned mr jenrick has labelled allegations against him as wild accusations and baseless innuendo he wants answers to his 26 questions by july 6 and has invited mr jenrick to give speak at a public evidence session on july 13 sir keir starmer has attacked boris johnson 's flippant attitude to the relaxation of lockdown pointing to a major incident on bournemouth beach last week which he suggested could have been averted these are matters of life and death the labour leader told the prime minister at pmqs as he asked whether mr johnson regretted not putting measures in place to avert mass influxes of people to tourist attractions his comments come after south coast councils said they were completely overstretched as huge numbers of visitors defied advice to stay away from beaches on the hottest day of the year so far last week a major incident was declared in bournemouth as it was estimated 500,000 people attended the beach just days after the prime minister announced the forthcoming reopening of pubs following the announcement mr johnson was asked in the commons how seaside towns should cope with the expected influx of people the pm replied saying they should show some guts at pmqs today sir keir said two days later bournemouth beach was closed with 500,000 visitors a major incident was declared does the prime minister now regret being so flippant mr johnson replied that he was making it absolutely clear that as we go forward with our plan our cautious plan for opening up the economy it is very very important that people who do represent seaside communities places where uk tourists will want to go should be as welcoming as they can possibly be he added but it is also vital that people have to behave responsibly and that is why the scenes in bournemouth were completely unacceptable and that is why we stick to the advice that we have given at pmqs the prime minister was also accused of being so slow to act regarding the spike of coronavirus cases in leicester which led to a localised lockdown sir keir said the prime minister 's inaction caused a lost week for officials in leicester who were not provided with vital coronavirus testing data he claimed up until last thursday local authorities in leicester were only given half of the data the local authority thought there were 80 positive tests in the last fortnight when the real figure was 944 he said so there was a lost week whilst the virus was spreading during pmqs he told the commons at the daily press conference on june 18 the health secretary said there s an outbreak of covid-19 right now in parts of leicester yet it was only on monday evening this week that the government introduced restrictions that s a delay of 11 days during which the virus was spreading in leicester why was the government so slow to act how the national coronavirus testing system failed leicester what does lockdown lifting look like across the uk airbus planning to cut 1,700 jobs in uk as result of coronavirus crisis prime minister johnson claimed the government acted decisively and put on the brakes in leicester he told the commons actually the government first took notice and acted that was going on in leicester on june 8 because we could see there was an issue there we engaged actively with the authorities in leicester with public health in leicester with everyone responsible in leicester in the way we have done with other areas that have had similar issues unfortunately in leicester it did not prove possible to get the results that we have seen elsewhere so on monday we took the decision which i hope the right honourable gentleman approves of to go into lockdown in leicester because i have been absolutely clear with the house and with the country we are going forward we have made huge progress but where necessary we will put on the brakes we acted decisively and i think it was the right thing to do sir keir said the 4,000 business and the 160 schools that are now shut might take some persuading that the government acted quickly enough video report by itv news political editor robert peston boris johnson has announced billions in funding to rebuild britain after the coronavirus crisis but labour leader sir keir starmer has said the cash is not enough the prime minister 's plans to build hundreds of thousands of new homes across the uk and dozens of infrastructure projects with a support package worth billions he is changing planning regulations to make it easier for people to build new homes extend their dwelling or repurpose a building in order to make it a place for living hoping to emulate franklin delano roosevelts 1930 's new deal which lifted the us out of the great depression mr johnson has announced the bringing forward of a 5bn plan to boost capital investment projects support jobs and fast track economic recovery on the cash sir keir said there is not much that s new and its not much of a deal adding what s been announced amounts to less than 100 per person and its the re - announcement of many manifesto pledges and commitments so its not enough the 5bn comes alongside a 12bn affordable homes programme aimed at supporting the building of up to 180,000 new affordable homes over the next 8 years new rules will mean a wider range of commercial buildings will be allowed to change to residential use without the need for a planning application builders will no longer need a normal planning application to demolish and rebuild redundant residential and commercial buildings if they are repurposed as homes law will be changed to enforce local lockdown in leicester health secretary says and property owners will be able to build additional space above their properties via a fast track approval process so long as neighbours approve of the extension prime minister johnson said he has set up project speed with chancellor rishi sunak in order to scythe through red tape and get things done in order to build better greener and faster it sounds positively rooseveltian it sounds like a new deal mr johnson said adding this is a government that is wholly committed not just to defeating coronavirus but to using this crisis finally to tackle this countrys great unresolved challenges of the last three decades the government says developers will still need to adhere to high standards and regulations just without the unnecessary red tape itv news political editor robert peston explains how the uk is entering a very bad period economically changes will come into force in september as the prime minister tries to level up the uk after the coronavirus crisis which many hope will have subsided after summer there is also 5bn going towards capital investment projects to support jobs and economic recovery the package includes 1.5bn for hospital maintenance 100 m for 29 road network projects and over 1bn to fund the first 50 projects of a new ten year school rebuilding programme starting from 2020 - 21 some 560 m and 200 m will go towards repairs and upgrades at schools and fe colleges 142 m will fund digital upgrades and maintenance to around 100 courts and 83 m will support the maintenance of prisons and youth offender facilities there 's also 60 m for temporary prison places 900 m for a range of shovel ready local growth projectsin england as well as 96 m to accelerate investment in town centres and high streets through the towns fund this year too many parts of this country have felt left behind neglected unloved as though someone had taken a strategic decision that their fate did not matter as much as the metropolis the prime minister said peston why these are the critical days for boris johnson 's government and so i want you to know that this government not only has a vision to change this country for the better we have a mission to unite and level up- the mission on which we were elected last year to avoid the use of greenfield sites cash has been allocated from the 400 m brownfield land fund to the west midlands greater manchester west yorkshire liverpool city region sheffield city region north of tyne and tees valley to support the building of around 24,000 homes an additional 450 m will be awarded to the home builders fund to help smaller developers access finance for new housing developments the cash will assist the delivery of 7,200 new homes under the affordable homes programme will be a 1,500 unit pilot of first homes which will be sold to first time buyers at a 30 % discount the discount will be fixed by law in order to keep the homes affordable for generations of families to own also announced in the prime minister 's speech in dudley was a a planning policy paper due in july which will set out a plan to reform englands seven decade old planning system the government hopes the plan will introduce a new approach that works better for the uk 's economy and society pm 's 1 billion schools pledge a very small gesture the prime minister said to build the homes to fix the nhs to tackle the skills crisis to mend the indefensible gap in opportunity and productivity and connectivity between the regions of the uk to unite and level up to that end we will build build build build back better build back greener build back faster and to do that at the pace that this moment requires mr johnson hopes his plan will create jobs and aid financial recovery after the uk 's economy was severely damaged by the coronavirus pandemic wrapping up his speech mr johnson said if we deliver this plan together then we will together build our way back to health we will not just bounce back we will bounce forward stronger and better and more united than ever before travelling to dudley on tuesday for the pms socially distanced new deal launch was a bit of shocker it was as though i had gone through a time slip to behind the iron curtain circa 1985 there was almost no one in stations apart from uniformed officials not a sandwich in sight at the buffet manifold shops still shut despite being urged to open this is a deep freeze in mid summer its impoverishing for all of us literally so for all boris johnsons determination to change the narrative from viral despair to hope his new deal is as of tuesday night the equivalent of lighting a match to melt a glacier his 5billion of accelerated investment is equivalent to a quarter of a percentage point of our national income or gdp against a record breaking forecast collapse in our national income this year 40 to 50 times as great and in a way the underlying reality is worse still in respect of what most of us think is fair and in respect of johnsons stated mission to level all of us up in that the weight of calamity is heaviest on the poorest with lowest or least adaptable skills pending vaccine this is a disease that can only be held at bay with social distancing and is therefore especially lethal for shops restaurants bars entertainment venues gyms and anywhere that we go as a mob which means that as the governments employment support schemes taper to nothing in the coming three to four months those thrown out of work are not the same as the factory workers who moved into call centres or shops or chauffeuring over the past 40 years the multiple economic shocks since 1979 have all caused human tragedies of legions of individuals robbed of the dignity of work by the absence of demand for their redundant skills but even if johnson succeeds in his stated aim of rebalancing the economy away from consumption and towards making and exporting partly with the unwanted help of an illness that deadens the desire to consume it is impossible to turn a shop worker or waiter into an engineer or a bricklayer or a carer overnight which means that if hope is not to be lost by the cheerful faces of our lost shop till you drop and drink till you barf culture if school and university leavers are not to be robbed of years of career progression one pledge made by the pm on tuesday matters more than all the rest that is his promise to give relevant training to anyone who needs it his so called opportunity guarantee but we do nt know where the capacity to provide that training will be found how much it will cost and how decisions will be made about which skills are most likely to provide a reward the holy grail of industrial policy my entire 40 year career has been creating a system of lifelong learning so that the immorality of unsought unemployment can be minimised never has it been more desperately needed more from robert peston why these are the critical days for boris johnson 's government boris johnson makes controversial appointment of brexit aide david frost as national security adviser former prime minister theresa may has questioned why her replacement boris johnson has chosen a political appointee with no proven expertise to be the government 's new national security adviser nsa backbencher ms may attacked prime minister johnson 's recent decision to appoint one of his closest allies david frost to the national security council suggesting he would be unable to provide expert independent advice sir mark sedwill the person being replaced by mr frost was appointed cabinet secretary and nsa by mrs may during her time in office but it appears the influence of dominic cummings in the current government may have spelled the end for the uk 's former top civil servant sir mark announced over the weekend he will step down in september and the uks current brexit negotiator mr frost is set to take up the role uk 's top civil servant sir mark sedwill to stand down itv news political editor robert peston said mr frost is close todominic cummings and his appointment is being viewed as a win for the prime minister 's top adviser in his new role mr frost will continue as a political adviser rather than becoming a member of the civil service and a formal process will begin to find a new cabinet secretary to replace sir mark the prime minister has faced criticism for appointing a political special adviser to a position previously filled by permanent civil servants minister for the cabinet office michael gove said that it is entirely appropriate for the prime minister to choose an adviser appropriate to the needs of the hour during a commons debate about mr frost 's appointment ms may said i served on the national security council for nine years six years as home secretary and three as prime minister during that time i listened to the expert independent advice from national security advisers on saturday mr gove said we must be able to promote those with proven expertise why then is the new national security adviser a political appointee with no proven expertise in national security mr gove responded we have had previous national security advisers all of them excellent not all of them necessarily people who were steeped in the security world some of whom were distinguished diplomats in their own right boris johnson makes controversial appointment of brexit aide david frost as national security adviser uk 's top civil servant sir mark sedwill to stand down peston why these are the critical days for boris johnson 's government david frost is a distinguished diplomat in his own right and it is entirely appropriate that the prime minister of the day should choose an adviser appropriate to the needs of the hour number 10 has also defended the adviser 's appointment saying such political appointments were not unusual in other countries the appointment of the nsa is always a decision for the prime minister the spokesperson said it is not unusual in other countries for ambassadors to serve as national security advisers and ambassadors can be political appointees david frost has the status of an ambassador the first civil service commissioner has agreed the appointment that is consistent with the constitutional reform and governance act boris johnson has unveiled plans to build build build britain out of economic mire caused by the coronavirus pandemic part of the strategy announced on tuesday means there will be new planning rules will come into force in september making it easier to build new homes pm pledges billions to build thousands of new homes what does it all mean new regulations will make it easier to change land use in town centres allowing empty shops to be converted into new homes number 10 have claimed the proposals were the most radical reforms to our planning system since world war ii so how will it work more types of commercial premises will have total flexibility to be repurposed through reform of the use classes order a building used for retail would be able to be permanently used as a cafe or office without requiring a planning application and local authority approval but pubs libraries village shops and other facilities judged to be essential to communities will not be covered by these flexibilities what about planning applications a wider range of commercial buildings will be allowed to change to residential use without the need for a planning application builders will no longer need a normal planning application to demolish and rebuild vacant and redundant residential and commercial buildings if they are rebuilt as homes what about extensions property owners will be able to build additional space above their properties via a fast track approval process subject to consultation with neighbours when will this come in they are expected to come into effect by september through changes to the law number 10 officials stressed that developers will still need to adhere to high standards and regulations but without the unnecessary red tape this all sounds vaguely familiar efforts to make it easier to build more homes have been going on for years under successive governments in march 2019 then local government secretary james brokenshire promised new planning rules so the owners of high street premises can change the way the buildings are used more easily mr brokenshire had also proposed a new right to allow buildings to extend upwards to create new homes did the prime minister announce anything else on housing officials will examine how public sector owned land can be managed and released possibly for new homes or environmental schemes the pilot of the previously announced first homes scheme will see 1,500 homes sold to first time buyers at a 30 % discount which will remain in perpetuity for future owners money from the 400 million brownfield land fund has been allocated to the west midlands greater manchester west yorkshire liverpool city region sheffield city region and north of tyne and tees valley to support around 24,000 homes anything else more change is coming down the track with a planning policy paper expected next month to set out a comprehensive reform of the entire system how are the proposals being received the campaign to protect rural england cpre warned that deregulation would not help address the housing shortage because it is already far too easy to build poor quality homes cpres tom fyans said transferring decision making power from local councils and communities and handing them to developers is the exact opposite of building back better the prime minister will announce a new deal for the united kingdom as he looks to take the country back to prosperity boris johnson will lay out a number of large infrastructure projects which is hoped will create jobs and aid the economic recovery an investment of 5bn which is being compared to franklin delano roosevelts 1930 's new deal will be made it sounds positively rooseveltian it sounds like a new deal mr johnson is expected to say on tuesday all i can say is that if so then that is how it is meant to sound and to be because that is what the times demand a government that is powerful and determined and that puts its arms around people at a time of crisis this is a government that is wholly committed not just to defeating coronavirus but to using this crisis finally to tackle this countrys great unresolved challenges of the last three decades to build the homes to fix the nhs to tackle the skills crisis to mend the indefensible gap in opportunity and productivity and connectivity between the regions of the uk to unite and level up to that end we will build build build itv news political editor robert peston on the pm 's likely announcement money will be spent on hospital maintenance road networks and building schools among other things the investments will be made across the country with money being directed to the former labour heartlands in the north where the tories won seats at the last election too many parts of this country have felt left behind neglected unloved as though someone had taken a strategic decision that their fate did not matter as much as the metropolis and so i want you to know that this government not only has a vision to change this country for the better we have a mission to unite and level up- the mission on which we were elected last year liberal democrat education spokeswoman and party leadership contender layla moran said mr johnson was offering nothing new she said boris johnson is attempting to hoodwink the nation again with reheated promises rather than seizing this moment to move forward as a country this speech looks like a rehash of manifesto pledges with no real plan to deliver a greener and fairer future it shows this government has already run out of ideas and run out steam the prime minister also needs to realise that our infrastructure is human not just bricks and mortar we need a mass retraining programme and a cast iron promise not to repeat the mistakes of the thatcher years and leave entire communities behind robert peston why these are the critical days for boris johnson 's government video report by itv news correspondent stacey foster ministers and top health and science advisers are to meet on monday evening as it looks increasingly likely a lockdown in leicester will be extended the city 's mayor sir peter soulsby said the government was still minded to extend the current level of restrictions for two weeks which could see pubs restaurants and hairdressers in leicester forced to stay closed for another fortnight after a rise in coronavirus cases sir peter said he remains sceptical after his discussion with health secretary matt hancock on monday afternoon took matters no further than the report he received in earlier it comes as itv news has learned the city 's walkers crisps factory saw 28 coronavirus cases in june the factory is to stay open as it is understood that the transmission of the virus has occurred within the community not within the factory a walkers ' spokesperson said the safety of our team and their families is our number one priority and we continue to maintain the highest level of vigilance to help prevent the spread of the virus and to protect our people we have seen an increase in the number of confirmed cases reflecting the situation in the local community and coinciding with the roll out and uptake of testing we are in regular contact with the local health authorities and government bodies and are reassured that we have all the correct measures in place to protect our employees sir peter has heavily criticised the government over its handling of the situation in the city saying he needs to be convinced that an extension to lockdown is necessary according to public health england data almost 3,000covid-19cases have been confirmed in leicester since the start of the coronavirus epidemic of these 866 cases were reported in the last two weeks withenglands pubs restaurantsand hairdressers set to reopen on july 4 the people of leicester may have to wait for the recent flare up to subside sir peter said a public health england phe report sent to him overnight had been cobbled together and readily acknowledges that cases are higher in leicester due to higher levels of testing in the city itv news science editor tom clarke on the situation in leicester this would mean pubs restaurants hairdressers outdoor playgrounds and other areas would not reopen in line with the rest of england as planned on july 4 he also told bbc radio 4s today programme of his anger saying it was only last thursday that we finally got some of the data we need but were still not getting all of it and it was only at 1.04am that the recommendations for leicester arrived in my inbox what they re suggesting is not a return to lockdown it seems that what they re suggesting is that we continue the present level of restriction for a further two weeks beyond july 4 i ve looked at this report and frankly its obviously been cobbled together very hastily its superficial and its description of leicester is inaccurate and certainly it does not provide us with the information we need if we are to remain restricted for two weeks longer than the rest of the country it has previously been suggested that a local lockdown could include identifying the surge at testing centres informing infected communities communication campaigns including leaflets and visits by health officials shutting individual businesses and schools and requiring people to self isolate speaking about the situation in the city on monday morning boris johnson said the government was concerned about leicester and talked of the need for a whack a mole strategy amid suggestionsthe city could have an extended lockdown on a visit to a construction site in west london the prime minister said we are concerned about leicester we are concerned about any local outbreak i want to stress to people that we are not out of the woods yet we are making these cautious calibrated steps we are opening as much of hospitality as we can on july 4 opening as much of the economy as we can some things alas still remain closed until they can become covid secure but to make all that possible we have to remain vigilant he said the local strategy had worked in weston super mare and where there had been outbreaks around gp surgeries in london it is unclear whether that would mean just the place where an outbreak occurred like a factory or an entire geographical area leicester public health director ivan browne was also critical about the level of information given to the city to tackle the outbreak he told the today programme i do nt think at the moment were seeing a single cause or a single smoking gun on this so we need really try to dig down and find out what is going on and its likely to be a combination of factors information has been challenging all the way through this the labour mp for leicester east claudia webbe said the governments lifting of lockdown restrictions on july 4 while her constituency was seeing a new spike in cases would be reckless she said countrywide lockdown measures introduced in late march should be re introduced in leicester such as asking people to stay in their homes as much as possible and the two metre social distancing restriction scotland could ask people from other parts of the uk to quarantine after nicola sturgeon warned england did not appear to be trying to eradicate coronavirus the first minister said she was not currently planning to force people arriving from england wales and northern ireland to quarantine but would consider doing so if it is required from a public health perspective ms sturgeon told the scottish governments daily coronavirus briefing we have to be on our guard against cases coming into scotland from elsewhere she explained her governments coronavirus strategy was to get as close to elimination as possible but suggested the uk government was letting it circulate at higher levels ms sturgeon said i would really welcome a statement from the prime minister that englands strategy was about trying to eliminate the virus as well as opposed to what appears to me to be perhaps letting it circulate at higher levels as long as it does nt threaten to overwhelm the national health service we have to keep these things under review if we want to keep our levels of infection as low as we can get them she added i m not trying to be overly critical here i m just being very clear with people what the scottish governments strategy is which is to get to elimination if we possibly can pubs hairdressers and cinemas to reopen in scotland from july 15 nicola sturgeon confirms scotland reports no coronavirus deaths for fourth consecutive day as uk death toll rises by 25 but also being clear that if that is our strategy and other countries or other parts of the uk have a different approach which might mean infection levels are higher then clearly we then have to consider how we mitigate against our infection levels rising asked about whether further quarantine measures could come into force for travellers to scotland from other parts of the uk she added we have no plans to introduce any measures like this right now but i m not ruling anything out we are taking the time to consider the uk governments proposals around air bridges for the arrangements between parts of the uk and other countries she said so if we did see an ongoing divergence between infection rates and levels in scotland and other parts of the uk from a public health perspective we would require to give consideration about how we mitigate that and guard against infection rates rising in scotland as a result on the issue of border and immigration powers being reserved to the uk government ms sturgeon argued that rules over quarantine were linked to public health and therefore under scottish government control she expressed disappointment that the emergency cobra taskforce had not met for weeks and that said she would welcome genuine substantive discussions involving the four nations in advance of certain decisions being taken the prime ministers official spokesman said on the issue of quarantine we have taken a four nation approach to these matters throughout we have worked closely with the devolved administrations at all times and this continues asked whether scotlands first minister could block the plan the spokesman said we do continue to work with the scottish government on this our approach on the issue of quarantine has been a four nation one and we will continue to work with the devolved administrations scottish conservative leader jackson carlaw said the first minister needs to rule out any attempt to close off scotland from the rest of the uk while it may be that localised lockdowns will be needed to deal with individual flare ups over the months ahead they should be handled as such video report by itv news political correspondent shehab khan a 1 billion cash injection to schools in england pledged by boris johnson is a tiny tiny step in the right direction according to one headteacher the prime minister will attempt to kick start the economy after covid-19 with a decade long schools rebuilding plan in which construction work will start on the first 50 projects as soon as september 2021 but emily proffitt headteacher at cooper perry primary school in stafford says the announcement is a very small gesture after a decade of funding cuts ms proffitt told itv news we 've had a decade of underspending a decade of loss of everything so actually yes it is welcome we would never say we do n't want it however it is a tiny tiny step in the right direction parents face childcare chaos as pre - school settings may be forced to close i 'm really scared children 's coronavirus fears revealed in new impact report the pm is expected to announce a spending blitz during a speech on tuesday as he lays the groundwork for the uk to spend its way out of the coronavirus downturn by undertaking a vast building programme part of the plans will include a 10-year undertaking to improve school facilities along with sprucing up classrooms currently in use another 560 million will go towards school repairs in this financial year while further education colleges will see 200 million of the 1.5 billion promised by chancellor rishi sunak at the spring budget to transform college estates over the next five years fast tracked so work can be brought forward mr johnson speaking before a school visit planned for monday said all children deserve the best possible start in life regardless of their background or where they live the pm said as we bounce back from the pandemic its important we lay the foundations for a country where everyone has the opportunity to succeed with our younger generations front and centre of this mission this major new investment will make sure our schools and colleges are fit for the future with better facilities and brand new buildings so that every child gets a world class education he added details of the programme along with eligibility for funding will be laid out in full at the next spending review according to number 10 investment will be targeted at school buildings in the worst condition across england including substantial investment in the north and the midlands the government is aiming for the projects to utilise modern and green construction methods both to help meet the uks net zero emissions target by 2050 and also create highly skilled jobs in the construction sector education secretary gavin williamson said replacing and upgrading poor condition school and college buildings with modern energy efficient designs will give our students and teachers the environment they deserve and support them to maximise their potential but liberal democrat education spokeswoman layla moran called the pms announcement spin over substance the funding is nowhere near the 7 billion the national audit office has said is needed to repair our schools said the mp labour leader sir keir starmer said mr johnson would have to ensure his building programme reversed a lost decade of stagnant investment in many parts of the country new analysis from the opposition party suggested seven of englands nine regions saw a reduction in public capital investment per person over the past 10 years since the conservatives came to power in some parts of the country including yorkshire east midlands and the south west investment per person is still less than half that seen in london said labour the party said all regions had seen a decrease in both health and education investment per person since david cameron became prime minister in 2010 class size limits could be expanded to get pupils back to school minister says government u turns on children 's free summer meals after previously rejecting plea from marcus rashford sir keir said for much of the country the tories record on building and investment has been a lost decade our recovery from the coronavirus crisis needs to match the scale of the challenge he added it must be built on solid foundations it has to work for the whole country and end the deep injustices across the country we are on the cusp of one of the biggest economic crises we have ever seen the government must immediately prioritise protecting peoples lives and livelihoods that s why labour has called for a back to work budget that has a laser like focus on one thing jobs jobs jobs these may well be the defining few days of the johnson government having failed to make a towering success of the initial response to the covid-19 crisis by his own admission on times radio on monday morning the prime minister is now embarking on the kind of structural reform of the machinery of government and of how the government supports the economy that will determine whether he will be seen by future generations as a homeric hero or homer simpson so far we can see the building blocks of the reconstruction rather than the detail these blocks include first supposedly significant infrastructure investment as a response to the economic calamity that is the consequence of the coronavirus calamity what the prime minister this morning called doubling down on the commitments he made in his election manifesto at the end of last year rather than responding to the explosion of government debt with cuts to public services and second they are to give more political direction to whitehall and to people the civil service with more data scientists and those who have proven skills in delivering projects and assessing results rather than those with the traditional kind of cognitive humanities backgrounds who johnson fears are more expert in analysing problems than solving them of course when i talk about the johnson government what i actually mean is the johnson / cummings / gove government since that is the troika who promulgate this red toryism what is profoundly unclear and how could it be at this early juncture and in the mayhem of this covid-19 era is whether any of this will work in restoring health and prosperity take the decision to turn the post of national security adviser hitherto the preserve of career civil servants into a political post with the appointment to it of johnson 's brexit negotiator david frost this could backfire horribly if as some mandarins fear but they would would n't they the spooks and military top brass wo n't reveal their secrets to someone who is not really of their ilk and frost starts with the handicap that johnson himself alienated much of the so called deep state when he was foreign secretary and although cummings gove and johnson may be right that the cabinet office at the heart of government is no longer fit for purpose in replacing sir mark sedwill in the lynchpin role of cabinet secretary it will not fit their purpose in the long run if they appoint a flunky without the backbone to tell them when they are wrong or choose someone who does not properly understand the byzantine ways of whitehall and is therefore unable to bend other public servants to their will in other words and having already relegated his cabinet colleagues to a role of marginal influence johnson is about to embark on a bold experiment that strikingly for this brexiteer in chief is quite frankly not very british the pursuit of french style grands projets and modernisation of infrastructure and the marginalisation within the machinery of government of the oxbridge generalist by a pm who is the quintessence of oxbridge generalist bluffer it is a quiet but revolutionary coup and like all coups it is high risk the

uk 's top civil servant has announced he is standing down from the position sir mark sedwill has announced he will leave his role as cabinet secretary national security adviser and head of the civil service in september it is understood the government will return to having a separate cabinet secretary and national security advisor one of boris johnson 's closest allies david frost is to replace sir mark as national security advisor mr frost is the uk 's current brexit negotiator with the eu itv news political editor robert peston also reports mr frost is close to the prime minister 's chief aide dominic cummings and the departure of sir mark is part of cummings ' long standing plan to end whitehall groupthink by replacing traditional mandarins with data scientists and physicists robert also reported there will be a formal process to appoint the new cabinet secretary meaning sir mark will remain in the post for some time in a statement sir mark said it had been a privilege to serve in his role following more than 30 years in government service i am fortunate to have served in some of the most challenging and rewarding jobs in national and international public service under seven prime ministers and in extraordinary times he said itv news political editor robert peston explains how sir mark sedwill 's announcement is not a brilliant start for this government after the coronavirus crisis boris johnson has nominated sir mark for a life peerage and has also asked him to lead a new g7 panel on global economic security as the uk assumes the presidency with a mission to ensure that the global free trading system on which our economy is based remains fair competitive and secure the prime minister said over the last few years i have had direct experience of the outstanding service that you have given to the government and to the country as a whole it has been by any standards a massive contribution but as pm i have particularly appreciated your calm and shrewd advice you have also spoken with a unique authority unusual in a cabinet secretary on international affairs and national security and as national security adviser you have done much to keep this country safe it is therefore great news that you have agreed to continue to serve this country on the international stage beginning with the uk 's preparations for the g7 summit next year you have done it all in whitehall from afghanistan to the modernisation of the civil service from immigration policy to brexit and defeating coronavirus after serving for decades with great distinction and unflappable good humour i believe you have earned the gratitude of the nation itv news political correspondent paul brand explains how significant sir mark sedwill 's announcement is shadow minister for the cabinet office helen hayes paid tribute to sir mark 's dedication we pay tribute to the work mark sedwill has done the labour mp said he has been a dedicated public servant and has run the civil service in difficult times on the day it was revealed millions of jobs across the country could be under threat in the coming months it is very concerning that boris johnson and dominic cummings are preoccupied with reshuffling whitehall number 10 on saturday announced a series of reforms which will see mr johnson given a firmer grip over his cabinet mr johnson will chair a number of new strategic committees as part of his cabinet operation which government sources said would be responsible for setting direction on the government 's domestic international and economic priorities sir mark 's departure is seen as a win for the pm 's chief aide dominic cummings who is according to the times said to have told a meeting of political aides this week that hard rain is going to fall after explaining how he felt whitehall 's fundamental shortcomings had been displayed during the coronavirus crisis sir ed davey acting leader of the liberal democrats said sir marks resignation as cabinet secretary showed the political strength of the prime ministers chief aide dominic cummings he said boris johnson is clearly ready to grant cummings his every wish when it comes to politicising the civil service and sweeping out those who may try to hold his government to account sedwills departure threatens to introduce yet more instability into the civil service at a time when it is already stretched to breaking point by the covid-19 crisis the largest economic downturn in living memory and the imminent threat of a no deal brexit the prime minister must be absolutely clear about any further plans for civil service reform and must guarantee full parliamentary scrutiny of these our world class civil service fulfils a vital role we can not afford to see it hollowed out cabinet secretarysir mark sedwillwas the countrys top civil servant and the most powerful official in government the 54-year old former diplomat was appointed to the role in 2018 when he was already the national security adviser critics including former chancellor george osborne questioned the sustainability of the grammar school and oxford educated civil servant handling the two roles pm makes controversial appointment of brexit aide as national security adviser on sunday june 28,sir mark announced he will stand down from his role as cabinet secretary national security adviser and head of the civil service in september dubbed the ultimate securocrat sir mark became the civil services highest ranking official after running the home office between 2013 and 2017 sir mark was a trusted lieutenant oftheresa maywhen she was pm and sat in her dwindling trusted inner circle after working with her for years at the home office as permanent secretary sir mark oversaw the establishment of the troubled inquiry into the departments handling of allegations about paedophile activity between the 1970s and 1990s he was also forced to tackle fall out from the termination of a contract to provide the controversial eborders programme when a tribunal ruled the government should pay out more than 220 million to a us defence firm in 2018 he played a role in the response to the poisoning of the skripals in salisbury known as a keen golfer windsurfer and scuba diver sir mark has also been at the centre of brexit preparations in whitehall in april 2019 the daily mail claimed to have gained a copy of a 14-page letter the cabinet secretary sent to ministers warning them of the consequences of a no deal brexit he rose to the defence of the prime ministers europe adviser olly robbins following criticism from eurosceptics he was thwarting the brexit process last year currenteducation secretary gavin williamsonaccused mrs may and sir mark of badly mishandling the investigation into the leak of information from a top secret meeting of the national security council and called for a probe into it mr williamson was sacked from his role of defence secretary over his alleged involvement in the leak of information about chinese tech giant huawei sir mark was said to be furious at the leak and his investigation was reportedly uncompromising in its dealing with cabinet ministers and aides hauling them in for interviews issuing questionnaires and demanding they hand over mobile phones mr williamson and his allies claimed his eventual toppling was part of a vendetta pursued against him by sir mark the pair were reported to have had a series of clashes during mr williamsons time at the ministry of defence mod in an interview with the civil service quarterly in february 2019 sir mark admitted he had an unusual background for a cabinet secretary having spent much of his career overseas he joined the foreign and commonwealth office fco in 1989 serving in egypt iraq cyprus and pakistan before becoming ambassador to afghanistan in 2009 he later worked as the nato senior civilian representative in the conflict hit country before becoming fco political director in 2012 sir mark studied at st andrews and oxford universities and is married with one daughter he was knighted in the 2017 new year honours list for services to national security one of boris johnsons closest allies david frost who has been negotiating the terms of the uks future relationship with the eu is to become national security adviser in succession to sir mark sedwill who is standing down both as cabinet secretary and nsa this is an unusual and controversial appointment because frost is a political appointment a special adviser in his current role and will continue as a political adviser rather than becoming a member of the civil service there will be a formal process to find a new cabinet secretary frost is close to dominic cummings and is routinely referred to as frosty in johnsons circle so anyone who has persuaded themselves that cummings 's influence has waned may need to re - think cummings 's pervasive influence was also manifest in the ditchley lecture given by michael gove which contained more details on cummingss long standing plan to end alleged whitehall groupthink by replacing traditional mandarins with data scientists and physicists or at least supplementing the humanities crowd with those from harder disciplines but back to frost whose appointment is bound to cause a bit of a big gulp among the spooks and military top brass they are not happy said one military source johnson is generous to sedwill in a handwritten letter to him thanking him for being a bridge to the new order of things since he became pm 11 months ago and sedwill will have an enduring role on the uks behalf chairing the panel on global economic security when the uk assumes the presidency of the g7 group of leading industrial nations next year which seems an odd appointment given that sedwills expertise is in the world of spooks not economics but there has been gossip in whitehall for months that he was not performing the central role expected of cabinet secretaries one cabinet member said that since simon case was appointed to the new role of 10 downing street 's permanent secretary mark has been invisible one important question that will be answered by an expected future public inquiry is what kind of role sedwill has played in the coronavirus disaster senior whitehall figures have complained he has not gripped the crisis to the extent they would have expected however the pm in his letter praised sir marks work on limiting the damage of the covid-19 epidemic and in helping to deliver brexit in sir marks letter to the pm he acknowledges that his dual role as cabinet secretary the most senior member of the home civil service and national security adviser was exceptional uk 's top civil servant sir mark sedwill to stand down video report by

dismissed for sharing an article online containing an allegedly anti - semitic conspiracy theory on thursday there had been calls from mps on the left of the party for the former shadow treasury minister to be reinstated but sir keir dismissed the demands following a meeting with riled backbenchers saying his mind was made up he has hand picked ms green mp for stretford and urmston to replace ms long bailey rebecca long bailey the left wing corbyn allys career in politics prior to her election in 2010 the 60-year old was chief executive of the child poverty action group and before that was director of the national council for one parent families now known as gingerbread announcing the decision on saturday sir keir said i m delighted to appoint kate green as shadow education secretary kate has spent a lifetime campaigning against child poverty and educational inequalities i look forward to working with her in this new role for ms green it is a return to the shadow cabinet after serving as shadow minister for women and equalities under mr corbyns leadership she quit after the referendum in what was seen by left wing critics as a coup against the islington north mp and went on to chair owen smiths failed leadership bid ms green mp said its a privilege to have been asked to serve as shadow education secretary the coronavirus pandemic has had a devastating impact on childrens

a conference call with sir keir to protest against ms long baileys dismissal as shadow education secretary sir keir speaking to the pa news agency on friday said the meeting with concerned mps was

put my statement out yesterday ms long bailey was fired on thursday after refusing to take down a tweet linking to an interview with the actor maxine peake in which she claimed police linked to the death of george floyd in the us had learned their tactics from the israeli secret services the former shadow education secretary however insisted it was not racist or anti - semitic to draw attention to concerns about police tactics the speed of sir keirs decision to move against her was being seen as fresh evidence of his willingness to take on the corbynistas she was the favoured candidate of the left when she stood against him in the labour leadership election earlier this year despite unhappiness among supporters of the former leader there was no sign of any other left wing frontbenchers

pillar of support and a partner for me since our days in college our children have tolerated my many absences over the years as they have grown studied and experienced the world they have not just supported me they have given mary and i the benefit of their views of the ireland which they have grown up with i was blessed to be born into the home which my late parents created for me and my

feud with fine gael dating back to the foundation of the state a century ago fine gael and fianna fael needed the support of the greens to have a working majority in the irish parliament equating to

to have continued close economic ties with the european union after brexit angela merkel has warned the german chancellor spoke with six european newspapers ahead of germany assuming the role of presidency of the eu council on july 1 it also comes just a day after boris johnsons senior brexit adviser signalled the next stage of talks with the eu would be tough majority of britons oppose weakening of food standards under uk us trade deal four years on from the eu referendum what s going on with brexit in comments carried by the guardian mrs merkel said with prime minister boris johnson the british government wants to define for itself what relationship it will have with us after the country leaves it will then have to live with the consequences of course that is to say with a less closely interconnected economy if britain does not want to have rules on the environment and the labour market or social standards that compare with those of the eu our relations will be less close mrs merkel 65 who has led germany since 2005 and will retire from politics when her fourth term as chancellor ends next year also said a no deal brexit would not be a personal defeat for her she said europe could only respond appropriately to the reality as britain sets out what it wants from talks mrs merkels comments come as the pms brexit adviser known as the sherpa on eu negotiations said the intensified process in discussions next week needed to be realistic david frost said the uk would not allow brussels the right to hit back at changes in british law with tariffs earlier mr johnson insisted the uk would reject an eu offer to extend the brexit transition period beyond the end of the year in bullish language mr frost insisted uk sovereignty over laws courts and fishing waters was not up for discussion he also said that what he called some of the eus more unrealistic positions would have to change in order to achieve progress mr frost said he was looking forward to the

out sir keir starmer has dismissed calls by labour leftwingers to reinstate rebecca long bailey after she was sacked for sharing an article online containing an anti - semitic conspiracy theory members of the campaign group of mps held a conference call with the labour leader to protest against ms long baileys dismissal as shadow education secretary but while they said the discussion had taken place in a mutually respectful manner they made clear sir keir had stuck to his guns saying there had been a significant disagreement between them long bailey sacking exposes labour tensions on dealing with anti - semitism claims rebecca long bailey the left wing corbyn allys career in politics the labour leaders office declined to comment on the talks saying it had been a private meeting ms long bailey was fired on thursday after refusing to take down a tweet linking to an interview with the actor maxine peake ms peake claimed police linked to the death of george floyd in the us had learned their tactics from the israeli secret services sir keir said he had acted in order to rebuild trust with the jewish community after years in which labour has been embroiled in allegations of anti - semitism under his predecessor jeremy corbyn however the move infuriated left wing allies of the former leader including ex - shadow chancellor john mcdonnell who rejected claims ms peakes comments were anti - semitic and said he stood in solidarity with ms long bailey in a statement following its meeting with sir keir the campaign group said it had also raised the issue of the freedom of party members to speak out on the issue of israel on the sacking of rebecca long bailey from the shadow cabinet it was clear that significant disagreement remains on this point the statement said the socialist campaign group of labour mps made it clear that rebecca long bailey should not have been sacked and should be reinstated the statement said the imminent annexation of the west bank by israels government was discussed and the need for the labour party mps party members and supporters to speak out against israels illegal annexation and ongoing human rights abuses by the government of israel was raised this was a businesslike exchange of views which took place in a mutually respectful manner rebecca long bailey has been sacked as shadow education secretary after sharing an article containing an anti - semitic conspiracy theory the party has said labour leader sir keir starmer who said he would have a no tolerance approach to anti - semitism within the party when taking over from jeremy corbyn asked ms long bailey to step down after she posted on twitter earlier on thursday the former labour leadership contender posted an article about maxine peake to twitter with the caption maxine peake is an absolute diamond labour said the article contained an anti - semitic conspiracy theory though ms long bailey says her post was nt intended to be an endorsement of all aspects of the article itv news political correspondent libby wiener said there has been much unhappiness from the left of the party over the decision to sack rebecca long bailey in an interview for the independent ms peake claimed the tactics used by the police in america kneeling on george floyds neck that was learnt from seminars with israeli secret services a claim denied by israel ms long bailey said i retweeted maxine peakes article because of her significant achievements and because the thrust of her argument is to stay in the labour party sir keir said it was wrong to share the article because it contained anti - semitic conspiracy theories i have therefore stood rebecca long bailey down from the shadow cabinet in comments reported by the bbc he said i ve made it my first priority to tackle anti - semitism and rebuilding trust with the jewish community is a number one priority for me culture corbyn and chaos labour 's recipe for election disaster major incident declared as thousands flock to south coast a spokesperson for sir keir starmer said as leader of the labour party keir has been clear that restoring trust with the jewish community is a number one priority anti - semitism takes many different forms and it is important that we all are vigilant against it former frontbencher long bailey said she had learned that many people were concerned by ms peake 's claims within the article i wished to acknowledge these concerns and duly issued a clarification of my retweet with the wording agreed in advance by the labour party leaders office but after posting i was subsequently instructed to take both this agreed clarification and my original retweet down she wrote on twitter i had asked to discuss these matters with keir before agreeing what further action to take but sadly he had already made his decision she added i am clear that i shall continue to support the labour party in parliament under keir starmers leadership to represent the people of salford and eccles and work towards a more equal peaceful and sustainable world the jeremy corbyn ally received immediate support from the ex - leaders former right hand man john mcdonnell who said criticism of practices of israeli state is not anti - semitic he went on i do nt believe therefore that this article is or rebecca long bailey should ve been sacked i stand in solidarity with her ms long bailey was one of the favourites to win the labour leadership election before sir keir won a landslide in the election in the end she was only able to win 27.6 % of votes sir keir won 56.2 % she was viewed by many as the continuity candidate for former leader mr corbyn who faced widespread calls of anti - semitism within the party while he was in charge instead of purging the front bench of mr corbyn supporters sir keir put ms long bailey in his shadow cabinet but vowed he would act immediately against anti - semitism an investigation into the labour party by the equality and human rights commission was called to look into claims of anti - semitism mike katz national chair of the jewish labour movement said ms long bailey 's sacking should be welcomed the labour party must be able to implement the kind of cultural and structural changes required to end institutionalised discrimination we hope that the party at every level reflect and learn from this action video report by itv news political correspondent daniel hewitt boris johnson is again backing housing secretary robert jenrick over a cash for favours row saying he has full confidence in the minister amid calls from labour for an inquiry into his behaviour mr jenrick is under increasing pressure after documents revealed the extent of contact between himself and multi - millionaire tory donor richard desmond before the cabinet minister signed off on the 1,500-home westferry printworks scheme in east london it revealed he was insistent the controversial development scheme was pushed through before a new tax levy came into force which would cost the developer millions of pounds the cache of letters and texts released on wednesday evening showed chummy correspondence between mr jenrick and former daily express owner mr desmond in which the property developer urged the minister to approve a development scheme so that marxists did not get doe for nothing jenrick insistent housing plan pushed through before levy document states westferry printworks key questions about approval for controversial development mr jenrick overruled planning inspectors to sign off the development application but later had to quash his own approval conceding that the decision was unlawful due to apparent bias former tory councillor andrew wood who quit the party in february over what he described as mr jenrick 's shocking decision said it was now time for the minister to leave the cabinet when asked by itv news whether mr jenrick should resign cllr wood said yes he should for two reasons number one because of the poor judgement he showed last year in terms of making the decision and if he ca nt deal with a in his terms a relatively small planning application how can he make those really big decisions despite the ongoing controversy the prime minister 's spokesman said mr johnson considers the matter closed labour leader sir keir starmer emphatically disagreed the prime minister needs to stop saying the matter 's closed it obviously is not closed he said robert jenrick needs to come clean full disclosure of all the documents all the relevant bits of paper answer all the questions i think there needs to be a cabinet office inquiry into his behaviour this has turned into a judgement call on the prime minister number 10 believes mr jenrick has already published the relevant documentation and it currently does not look like cabinet secretary mark sedwill will be probing the matter in a letter to labour sir mark said mr jenrick had set out a full and factual account of his actions adding in light of this account the prime minister considers that the matter is closed health secretary matt hancock offered his support to mr jenrick explaining how the cabinet secretary has looked at the correspondence its all been published and the cabinet secretary has decided that there is nt any need for any further investigation and that s why the prime minster regards this matter as closed labour wants mr jenrick to explain to mps his links with mr desmond after the breathtaking documents were released shadow communities steve reed said they raise far more questions about the controversy than they answer whether the prime minister likes it or not this matter is far from closed he said an explosive and unprecedented case of a secretary of state quashing his own unlawful biased decision to approve a cash for favours planning decision that saved a conservative donor over 150 million demands the utmost transparency that is why the secretary of state must come back to the house of commons to explain himself and why he must publish all remaining evidence the public need to know there is not one rule for the conservatives and their wealthy friends and another rule for everyone else downing street has since distanced itself from the row saying no one in number 10 has discussed this appeal with mr desmond or the applicants the spokesman was unable to say whether anyone in no 10 had discussed the development more generally with mr jenrick after downing street restated its backing for mr jenrick labour deputy leader angela rayner tweeted here we go again the untouchables the old boys network covering for each other disgusting this is nt a government its a farce not a spot of integrity amongst them critics say mr jenrick broke the ministerial code in a cash for favours row when after sitting next to media mogul mr desmond at a tory fundraising event and being shown about three or four minutes of promotional video about the project he overruled a planning inspector to approve it two weeks after the cabinet minister stepped in to approve the housing scheme electoral commission records show that mr desmond personally gave 12,000 to the conservatives mr jenrick originally gave the development the go ahead in january 2020 overruling both tower hamlets council and a planning inspector he subsequently reversed the ruling following legal action by the council admitting that what he did was unlawful by reason of apparent bias he has labelled allegations against him as wild accusations and baseless innuendo mr jenrick added transparency matters openness matters and settling this matter matters because i certainly do nt want to be the subject of the innuendo and the false accusations that the opposition are choosing to peddle sir bernard jenkin chairman of the commons liaison committee said he thought mr jenrick would survive the calls for him to resign the senior tory said clearly there has been a little bit of a mistake and the decision has had to be rescinded but there is no sign of actual maladministration the government 's coronavirus test and trace app will rely on individuals self declaring they are at risk of infection matt hancock has said speaking on itv 's peston show the health secretary said if the app says you are at risk it will be your responsibility to call the nhs and to quarantine data from the app will not he said be held centrally and so the nhs and the government wo n't know if you get an automatic alert the government recently abandoned its plans to set up its own tracing app switching instead to technology used by apple and google plans for the app have been beset with delays concerns about privacy and complaints about inaccuracy still no date for coronavirus tracing app as hancock blames apple for struggles clearing up the reason for the switch to different technology mr hancock said the app that had been in trials had not been able to transmit information to the state reliably he added the question is when the information is transmitted to the state and that will be based on the apple / google api and their way of doing things you know we wanted to do it differently because then the nhs can spot flare ups that functionality is n't available coronavirus contact tracing app what has changed and why is it taking so long one in four people with coronavirus missed by nhs tracing system the technology will however rely on users of the app to notify authorities they have received an alert that they are at risk meaning it will be up to individuals to self declare mr hancock told robert peston the way we 'll have to do it is that if your phone tells you that there 's a problem you 've been close to somebody who has tested positive instead of that data automatically coming to us people will have to self declare the health secretary added that business owners in the hospitality sector will not be held responsible for customers failing to give the correct information that would ensure they could be contacted should they be identified as at risk pressed on when the test and trace app is likely to be up and running mr hancock said i 'm not putting a date on it i 'm not putting a date on it he added i want it to work i 'm really glad now that we 've got apple are working really well and i 'm very grateful to them for coming to the table and we 're going to make it work executive chair of nhs test and trace baroness dido harding has previously said there would be a world class system in place by september why is nhs test and trace contacting only one in nine people infected with coronavirus on the frequency of covid-19 testing for nhs workers mr hancock told the peston show that staff would not be tested every week geneticist sir paul nurse told the show such a move would be a mistake adding that the uk has been playing catch up in its handling of the pandemic sir paul said there was the need for better preparation earlier in the pandemic pointing to the outbreak in countries like south korea as guidance he added that an app could have been in place ahead of when the coronavirus outbreak hit the uk asked what he thought of a what have we learned"-style inquiry into the handling of the crisis mr hancock said we 're constantly doing that sort of thinking i have n't seen that proposal all i care about is constantly finding out what works and adapting our response to it because we are still learning about this virus video report by itv news political correspondent carl dinnen housing secretary robert jenrick is under fire after documents state he was insistent a controversial development scheme was pushed through before a new levy would cost its tory donor backer millions of pounds the release of a stash of letters and texts show that multi - millionaire tory donor richard desmond urged mr jenrick to approve the east london development scheme so that marxists did not get doe for nothing the release of documents came after mr jenrick told mps he would outline the timeline of events and the rationale for his decision making over the westferry printworks planning decision labour said the timing of the planning approval just a day before a new community infrastructure levy cil came into force would have saved mr desmonds northern and shell company up to 50 million what is the issue and what is robert jenrick under fire for in a document a housing ministry official indicated the secretary of state sos wanted westferry to be signed off and approved the following day so that it would avoid the cil it stated on timing my understanding is that sos is was insistent that decision issued this week ie tomorrow as next week the viability of the scheme is impacted by a change in the london cil regime however prime minister boris johnson considers the matter closed according head of the civil service sir mark sedwill the comments came in a letter seen by the pa news agency which was sent to labours shadow communities secretary steve reed in response to his questions on what basis the housing secretary approved the development and what contact he had with the developer sir mark wrote that mr jenrick had set out a full and factual account of his actions adding in light of this account the prime minister considers that the matter is closed boris johnson still has full confidence in robert jenrick despite richard desmond housing row housing secretary robert jenrick accused of unlawfully approving tory donor 's bid to build 1,500 houses mr jenrick published information after labour tabled a motion which was approved directing the government to release all documents relating to the controversial approval by mr jenrick for the westferry development which was submitted by former media mogul mr desmond the housing secretary has faced accusations of cash for favours after it emerged ex - daily express owner mr desmond had personally given the conservative party 12,000 two weeks after the scheme for 1,500 homes was approved mr jenrick has since had to quash his own approval conceding the decision was unlawful the newly released documents show that in a text to mr desmond on november 18 after spending time with him at a tory fund raising event event mr jenrick said good to spend time with you tonight richard see you again soon i hope mr desmond replied thanks robert i really appreciate your text will call your office tomorrow to arrange very best in a text two days later regarding the development mr desmond said we appreciate the speed as we do nt want to give marxists loads of doe for nothing we all want to go with the scheme and the social housing we have proposed and spent a month at the marxist town hall debating thanks again all my best richard mr jenrick replied as secretary of state it is important not to give any appearance of being influenced by applicants of cases that i may have a role in or to have predetermined them and so i think it is best that we do nt meet until after the matter has been decided one way of sic another and i ca nt provide any advice to you on that other than to say that i will receive advice from my officials after the general election assuming i remain in office and will consider it carefully in accordance with the rules and guidance i hope that is okay and we can meet to discuss other matters soon hopefully on the 19th robert shadow communities secretary mr reed raised the issue in the commons after the release of the information asking if the cabinet minister would make a new statement he questioned whether mr jenrick would speak as specifically that he did not immediately notify officials following his dinner with the applicant richard desmond that rather than closing discussion down with the developer as mr jenrick implied he instead initiated contact with him the next day via text and the letters confirm that he rushed through the decision deliberately to help the developer

majority of those who test positive and their own contacts and getting them to self isolate and it is a formidable achievement the prime minister was told off by speaker lindsay hoyle for saying sir keir was misleading mps with the figures one of us is going to have to give way it will have to be you he said prime minister obviously no one misleads and no honourable member ever would which ever side they re from mr johnson rephrased saying sir keir was inadvertently giving a false impression of what test and trace is doing the prime minister as he has at previous pmqs referenced the labour leader 's former job as a lawyer i understand the constraints of the professions in which he used to work mr johnson said accusing him of yo yoing for initially welcoming the relaxation of lockdown before appearing to criticise it which is it is he supporting what were doing or is he against it he asked sir keir said he does support the changes but added 65,000 people have lost their lives because of covid-19 the prime minister could welcome challenge to save lives sir keir also asked about the lack of a heavily delayed nhs tracing app which the government originally said would be integral to the system tech problems were encountered during a pilot of the app on the isle of wight and the government has been seeking to downplay its importance since nhsx is no longer developing the app alone and is now working in collaboration with google and apple sir keir said the app really matters because unless someone with covid-19 can name and identify everybody they ve been in contact with the app is the only way of tracing unknown contacts he said up until last week the government maintained that the app was critical another of their slides at the daily briefing but at the weekend health secretary matt hancock downplayed the app saying it was only ever additional support so which is it critical or not uk must start preparing for second covid-19 wave what s changing on july 4 in england the new rules explained responding mr johnson asked the labour leader to name a single country in the world that has a functional contact tracing app because there is nt one germany 12 million downloads i checked that overnight fired back sir keir mr johnson said sir keir was completely wrong adding in the commons no country in the world has a working contact tracing app and i ve always been clear we ve always been clear that the app would be the icing on the cake if we can get it to work it ll be a fine thing but there is nt one anywhere in the world so far according to fullfact multiple countries have launched apps including germany france australia singapore and latvia however uptake has been fairly low and its too early to say whether they will be effective in helping combat covid-19 sir keir highlighted the concerns of local authorities that they will not have the powers to implement local lockdowns quickly in the event of outbreaks he said the real concern amongst council leaders is that they do nt have the powers or guidance to implement lockdowns quickly if needed sir keir added can the prime minister tell us when local authorities will get the guidance that they need the prime minister claimed local lockdowns had already been implemented for instance in weston super mare or gp surgeries in north london there have been local lockdowns local crackdowns we have a very effective cluster busting operation which is designed to ensure that we keep those outbreaks under control watch pmqs in full the wife of conservative former cabinet minister owen paterson has been found dead at their family home the mp has said in a statement former environment secretary mr paterson said the loss of his wife rose had come as a terrible shock to the family it is with great sadness that i must inform you that my wife rose has been found dead at our family home in shropshire he said rose and i were married for 40 happy years she was a wonderful caring wife mother and grandmother her death has come as a terrible shock to us all i would ask the media to respect the privacy of myself and my family at this extremely difficult time mrs paterson the daughter of the fourth viscount ridley was the chairman of aintree racecourse the couple married in 1980 and had two sons and a daughter mr paterson was in cabinet under david cameron from 2010 to 2014 first as northern ireland secretary before taking over the environment brief housing secretary robert jenrick has confirmed he will release all relevant information relating to his controversial decision to award a development project to tory donor richard desmond mr jenrick says he acted within the rules when he approved mr desmond 's application to build 1,500 houses worth 1 billion in east london but opposition mps suspected wrongdoing and a commons motion was tabled to try and force him into releasing documents relating to the decision despite previously refusing to share documents the 38-year old said he would write to the chair of the housing select committee outlining the timeline of events and the rationale alongside the letter he will be releasing later today all relevant information relating to this planning matter using the freedom of information act as a benchmark he acknowledged there are higher standards of transparency expected in the quasi - judicial planning process which is why i will also release discussions and correspondence which the government would not normally release critics say mr jenrick broke the ministerial code in a cash for favours row when after sitting next to media mogul mr desmond at a tory fundraising event and being shown about three or four minutes of promotional video about the project he overruled a planning inspector to approve it jenrick accused of unlawfully approving tory donor 's bid to build 1,500 houses coronavirus social distancing 2 m vs 1 m what does the science say two weeks after the cabinet minister stepped in to approve the housing scheme electoral commission records show that mr desmond personally gave 12,000 to the conservatives mr jenrick says the release of documents will show this was a decision taken with an open mind on the merits of the case after a thorough decision making process he has labelled allegations against him as wild accusations and baseless innuendo mr jenrick added transparency matters openness matters and settling this matter matters because i certainly do nt want to be the subject of the innuendo and the false accusations that the opposition are choosing to peddle labour 's steve reed asked why mr jenrick overruled professionals to take his decision adding without a credible answer the suspicion arises once again that the secretary of state was bending over backwards to do favours for his billionaire dinner date shadow secretary of state for communities and local government mr reed said cash paid to the tories after they sat together at dinner raises questions about cash for favours which would be a serious abuse of power mr jenrick said the accusations made against him were not simply wrong but actually outrageous but admitted things could and should have been done differently johnson still has full confidence in jenrick despite desmond housing row what s changing on july 4 in england the new rules explained he told mps any accusation that my view on a highly complex and publicised development could have been swayed by an encounter with a developer is not just simply wrong but actually outrageous who the applicant was is immaterial to my decision as it always is and always should be i knew nothing of the donation that was made and would never have allowed it to influence my decision even if i had known about the donation on monday boris johnson 's spokesman said the prime minister had full confidence in the housing secretary amid the row involving former daily express owner mr desmond it followed a sunday times report which revealed how mr desmond admitted showing mr jenrick a promotional video about his project at a tory fundraising event according to mr desmond after watching the video mr jenrick told him sorry richard i ca nt discuss it the cabinet minister then granted permission for the 1,500-flat development the day before a new council community levy would have cost mr desmonds company an extra 40 million the decision was later reversed after legal action by tower hamlets council and mr jenrick admitted what he did was unlawful by reason of apparent bias donald trump doubled down on calling covid-19 kung flu at a packed rally in arizona the us president 's second rally in less than a week drew energetic crowds as he spoke to young conservative students at a phoenix megachurch on tuesday the event was in stark comparison to trump 's weekend rally in tulsa oklahoma his first of the coronavirus era which drew sparser crowds anthony fauci next few weeks critical to containing virus spikes barack obama warns democrats against complacency trump hailed the patriotic young americans who stand up tall for america and refuse to kneel to the radical left you are the courageous warriors standing in the way of what they want to do and their goals he told the boisterous crowd they hate our history they hate our values and they hate everything we prize as americans trump rally flops in oklahoma but do n't count him out yet his address to the crowds was full of typical trump lines including boasts about tv ratings ridiculing his presidential rival joe biden and attacking china 's handling of the coronavirus crisis as he did in oklahoma over the weekend trump referred to the virus as kung flu a pejorative term that asian americans say is racist the weekend rally appeared to focus trump 's mind on his reelection campaign during his visit to the battleground state of arizona with trump telling supports it will be the most corrupt election in the history of our country and that we can not let this happen ahead of the rally dr anthony fauci the federal government 's top infectious disease expert warned that the us was at a critical crossroads in containing coronavirus he said right now the

difficulty bottom line its a mixed bag since late may arizona has emerged as one of the nations most active hot spots for the spread of covid-19 the democratic mayor of phoenix said she did not

a second wave of coronavirus ministers have been warned that urgent action is needed to prevent further loss of life and to protect the economy amid growing fears of a renewed outbreak over the winter the appeal is backed by the presidents of the royal colleges of physicians surgeons gps and nursing as well as the chairman of the british medical association it comes after boris johnson announced on tuesday the biggest easing to date of the coronavirus lockdown in england what can i and ca n't i do in england from july 4 the prime minister said the two metre social distancing rule would be replaced with a one metre plus rule paving the way for pubs restaurants hotels and cinemas to begin reopening from july 4 in an open letter to the leaders of all the uk political parties published in the british medical journal the health leaders call for a rapid and forward looking assessment of the state of national preparedness in the event of a renewed flare up while the future shape of the pandemic in the uk is hard to predict the available evidence indicates that local flare ups are increasingly likely and a second wave a real risk they said many elements of the infrastructure needed to contain the virus are beginning to be put in place but substantial challenges remain the job now is not only to deal urgently with the wide ranging impacts of the first phase of the pandemic but to ensure that the country is adequately prepared to contain a second phase they called for the creation of a cross - party commission with a constructive non - partisan four nations approach to be established to develop practical recommendations for action based on what had been learned so far we believe this will be essential if the uk is to get ahead of the curve they said it should focus on those areas of weakness where action is needed urgently to prevent further loss of life and restore the economy as fully and as quickly as possible we think there s a strong case for an immediate assessment of national preparedness with the first results available no later than august and that all its work should be completed by the end of october ministers have already said that the temporary nightingale hospitals set up in case the nhs was overwhelmed by covid-19 cases will remain on standby over the coming months the letter comes as imperial college economist professor david miles told bbc radio 5 the easing of lockdown measures was overdue he said we probably have gone past the point some weeks ago where the benefits of keeping in place the lockdown were large enough to match the rising and enormous costs of lockdown however at the final daily no 10 briefing both the governments chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance and the chief medical officer for england professor chris whitty stressed it was not a risk free move prof whitty said it was absolutely critical that people continued to observe social distancing taking steps to mitigate the spread of the disease when it was not possible to stay two metres apart he warned the virus was likely to be present in the uk until at least the spring of 2021 and that if people returned to their normal patterns of behaviour we will get an uptick for sure sir patrick also warned that despite the falling numbers of people infected with the disease the threat remained do nt be fooled that this means it has gone away the disease is growing across the world it is coming down in the uk but it has nt gone away he said the easing of the two metre rule was warmly welcomed by the hospitality sector which had warned that many pubs cafes and restaurants would be forced to close if it remained in place hairdressers barbers cinemas museums and art galleries in england are now also preparing to open their doors to visitors again from july 4 however close proximity businesses including nightclubs soft play centres indoor gyms nail bars and beauty salons will remain shut as will bowling alleys and water parks

health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus video report by itv news political editor robert peston prime minister boris johnson has set out a more detailed picture of how england will move further out of lockdown as he warned local outbreaks could force him to reverse some of these changes earlier mr johnson announced that pubs restaurants and hairdressers will be able to reopen from july 4 providing they adhere to covid secure guidelines in an attempt to help the hospitality industry 's reopening the safe social distance will become one metre plus chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance and professor chris whitty the chief medical officer sounded a far more cautious note as they stood alongside the prime minister at the final regular government daily coronavirus briefing warning the loosening of restrictions was not risk free sir patrick said the r number for the transmission of the coronavirus remains below one across the uk as the epidemic continued to shrink albeit slowly by between 2 % and 4 % a day do nt be fooled that this means it has gone away the disease is growing across the world it is coming down in the uk but it has nt gone away he said robert peston it 's not freedom day but complexity day pub hosts and screens what will the new normal look like in bars professor whitty said there was a risk coronavirus could start to increase in its spread if restrictions involved with the one metre plus rules were not followed speaking at the daily downing street briefing he said a lot of the changes are about emphasising things that we can do and it is really critical that individuals and firms take these really seriously what you can and ca n't do in england from july 4 as coronavirus lockdown measures are eased 2 into 1 does go pubs and hairdressers to reopen on july 4 because if we do nt take them seriously then chains of transmission between households will be reestablished prof whitty said such mitigation involved not sitting face to face or even physical barriers he added to be really clear it is absolutely critical that every individual every household and every firm takes these precautions seriously if that does not happen we will go back to a situation where transmission starts to rise again if people hear a distorted version of what s being said that says this is all fine now its gone away and start behaving in ways that they normally would have before this virus happened yes we will get an uptick for sure professor whitty continued itv news health correspondent emily morgan and political editor robert peston on the health risks of england 's lockdown easing and why the government have decided to lift restrictions now mr johnson has said that he takes full responsibility for the decision to ease the lockdown we are indebted to our scientific colleagues for their advice continually but it is our responsibility to choose under the changes indoor gatherings involving two separate households will be permitted including the possibility of staying overnight in homes hotels or b&bs but social distancing will need to be maintained where the two metre rule can not be applied it will be replaced with a one metre plus measure with the protection offered by the physical distance enhanced by other mitigation measures such as the use of face coverings increased hygiene or layout changes in premises despite the easing of lockdown measures from july 4 mr johnson said police would still have the powers to break up large gatherings and urged the public to act responsibly last week chancellor rishi sunak said a decision on whether to ease the two metre rule in england will be for ministers rather than the governments scientific advisers sir patrick has previously said the two metre restriction was not a scientific rule but a risk based assessment addressing mps in the commons on tuesday mr johnson warned thel measures will be under constant review and the government will not hesitate to apply the handbrake or reverse measures should the virus begin to run out of control the daily downing street coronavirus press conference is to be scrapped in favour of ad hoc briefings the government announced on tuesday itv news correspondent rachel younger meets the families happy to hear the news of lockdown easing briefings will instead take place to coincide with

minister unveils the next step in his roadmap to lifting lockdown measures social distancing dropped to one metre plus the two metre social distancing rule can now be relaxed and replaced with a one

use of hand sanitiser can i see a friend or family member who i do n't live with indoor gatherings of any two households will be allowed from july 4 people will be able to visit someones house for a

since lockdown began two of the most popular british pub chains wetherspoons and greene king have outlined how their outlets will look as they reopen their doors from july 4 in england while others have not been able to make plans a spokesman for one independent pub the gloucester old spot in cheltenham said they are all guns blazing for a reopening but need government guidance for the sector beyond the new one metre rule from signing in to going to the toilet and the new normal for bartenders and servers hundreds of pubs across the uk will have to change the way they operate reopening businesses many venues and businesses will be allowed to reopen as long as they are covid secure for example by maintaining social distancing these include hotels hostels bed and breakfast accommodation holiday apartments or homes cottages or bungalows campsites caravan parks or boarding houses boris johnson did however say shared facilities must be kept very clean restaurants cafes workplace canteens bars pubs and cinemas can reopen as can places of worship libraries community centres and bingo halls theatres and concert halls can reopen but not for live performances museums and

minister has announced and the two metre rule will become one metre plus from saturday july 4 pubs restaurants and hairdressers will be able to reopen providing they adhere to covid secure guidelines in a bid to assist their reopening the safe social distance will become one metre plus some form of infection mitigation for example on public transport it will be one metre plus a face covering the two metre rule should be followed where possible but where it can not be people should stay one metre apart and mitigate the risk of infection itv news health correspondent emily morgan on the risks of lifting lockdown in a further relaxation of the coronavirus lockdown from that date people will be able to meet indoors at home at the pub or anywhere else permitted to be open with one other household of any size at a time it 's not freedom day but complexity day children needing foster care rises 44 % during coronavirus pandemic prime minister boris johnson told mps in the house of commons our long national hibernation is beginning to come to and end and life is returning but he warned it will be all too easy for that frost to return he said all measures will be under constant review and the government will not hesitate to apply the handbrake or reverse measures should the virus begin to run out of control meeting households will not need to be exclusive and overnight stays will be permitted meaning for example one set of grandparents could stay over one night and another set the next though social distancing must still be observed two households will be able to meet indoors in any setting the prime minister said for example two groups could sit together at a restaurant but we are not recommending meetings of multiple households indoors because of the risk of creating greater chains of transmission mr johnson told mps mr johnson said he was trusting the public to use their common sense to follow the new measures as guidelines instead of legislation for outdoor meetings two separate households of any size will be able to meet up and could even go camping together because campsites are also due to reopen from july 4 people can enjoy staycations in england with the reopening of other accommodation sites including hotels b&bs hostels and caravan parks other businesses in the hospitality industry due to reopen include places of worship libraries community centres bingo halls cinemas museums galleries hair salon barbers outdoor playgrounds outdoor gyms arcades social clubs aquariums and zoos all businesses reopening must be able to ensure they are covid secure theatres and concert halls will be allowed to reopen but fans will be disappointed to learn live performances are not permitted there is an issue around singing and the way it can spread infection businesses which will not be allowed to reopen include nightclubs bowling alleys spas nail bars massage parlours indoor fitness centres indoor gyms sports venues water parks swimming pools and exhibition centres mr johnson said the culture secretary and business secretary would establish task forces with public health experts and the sectors to help closed businesses become covid secure and reopen he said we will also work with the arts industry on specific guidance to enable choirs orchestras and theatres to resume live performances as soon as possible recreation and sport will be allowed but indoor facilities including changing rooms and courts will remain closed and people should only play close contact team sports with members of their household labour leader sir keir starmer welcomed the pms statement he said we will study the guidance and there are obviously a number of questions that need to be answered but overall i welcome this statement i believe the government is trying to do the right thing and in that we will support them but he asked when the track and trace system would be in place he said the prime minister will know we have got very serious concerns about the gaps in the current system including the absence of an app getting this right is essential to unlocking in a safe manner mr johnson rubbished criticisms of the system saying it has had great success i\ the number of children needing foster care has risen by 44 % during the coronavirus pandemic creating a state of emergency a childrens charity said meanwhile the number of people looking to become foster carers has fallen by almost half over the same period barnardos added there were 2,349 referrals to the charitys fostering services between march 1 and april 23 this year in england wales and northern ireland up from 1,629 in the same period in 2019 and just 161 people inquired about becoming a foster carer during the two months down 47 % from 302 across the same period in 2019 the charity says vulnerable children who may have experienced neglect or abuse are now in a state of emergency as they wait to be placed with foster families barnardos chief executive javed khan said the coronavirus pandemic has hit vulnerable families the hardest with many reaching crisis point peston it 's not freedom day but complexity day this has created a state of emergency as more children than ever need a safe and loving foster family while fewer adults are coming forward as potential foster carers the charity says the covid-19 outbreak has increased pressures on families who are experiencing job losses deepening poverty and worsening mental health children have also been in lockdown in homes where domestic and sexual abuse is taking place at the same time inquiries from people looking to foster have dropped with many peoples situations affected by the virus and amid an uncertain future mr khan added today there are hundreds of children who have been referred to barnardos and are waiting to be placed with a foster family if you re over 21 have a spare room and the time and commitment to support a child in need please do consider getting in touch today men make more coronavirus antibodies than women new guidelines for 2.2 m people shielding in england pubs and cinemas to re open in latest lockdown easing the charity is appealing for adults including single people people identifying as lgbtq and those from black asian and minority ethnic backgrounds to get in touch if they can help foster carers will be supported by the charity with training and a dedicated social worker and will receive financial support a department for education spokesman said foster carers make a lifelong difference to the lives of the vulnerable children when they need it most we encourage more people to come forward both now and in the future so there are enough foster carers available at the right time and in the right place to provide safe loving homes for these children we have published guidance online for anyone interested in becoming a foster parent during the pandemic we have also made it easier for councils and fostering agencies to identify potential placements and to assess and approve new foster carers so that children get the support they deserve without delay welcome to c day where the c stands for the complexity of living with coronavirus because when the prime minister announces the return to something like normal living today our revised way of life will feel anything but normal and also bloomin complicated for example we 'll be able to have friends or family inside our houses again but not friends and family from different households at any one time just those from one household at a time and we wo n't be allowed to hug and we can continue to socialise with up to five people from different households if we are outside and if we live alone and we visit a household in a nominated bubble we will be able to hug it is the kind of systemic complexity that only young people with their flexible minds would be able to understand or at least they would if their education had not been suspended what are the new rules for shielders perhaps the most important reform today is that we are moving back to the nanny state and away from the coronavirus police state in that these rules will be guidelines not the law or at least it 's back to nanny for a while because if there is a surge in coronavirus cases there will be a return to some form of police state lockdown either local regional or national depending on whether nhs test and trace actually works what about the re - opening of swathes of the economy and our community infrastructure from pubs to cinemas to hotels well those pillars of our existence will feel open and thriving in the way that department stores were in soviet russia in the 1980s so when we go to the pub or restaurant we are likely to have to leave our names at the door just in case at some future juncture it turns out an infected person was sitting or standing nearby there 'll be perspex dividers between tables and even with dividers we 'll have to keep 1 m from others and if we can wear a face covering so much the better but you whoop at least it 's 1 m not 2 m which means only half of hospitality venues will go bust for lack of business rather than three quarters maybe but even the 2 m to 1 m is not quite what it seems because the distancing rule is most important in deciding who has to be quarantined under the track and trace system when we come into contact with an infected person surely fewer of us will now face quarantine if the distance is an easier to sustain 1 m rather than 2 m sorry not as simple as that we 'll still be quarantined if we 've been less than 2 m from a covid-19 sufferer for more than 15 minutes unless we 're both wearing masks or sitting side by side or there 's a perspex divider between us it could not be simpler could it i am so looking forward to the conversation with the tracer who rings me up to inform me that i have been in the dangerous proximity of an infected person and then we work out whether a gap of 1.75 m for 17 minutes from an infected person who was wearing a face covering when i ca n't remember if i was wearing mine means go directly to quarantine or not forgive my facetiousness this stuff is tricky but then this virus is a wily bugger and every country in the world is facing the same horrendous calculus namely how much to semi - permanently change the way of life to reduce the risk of another surge in infection while calibrating various restrictions on our freedoms by the differential cost to our prosperity our income against that backdrop all the talk from distinguished former chancellors about how a vat cut would make sense to stimulate economic activity is almost a joke because when it comes to our massively reduced capacity to spend at least as much of the problem is a supply constraint as inadequate demand for example the boss of a huge retailer tells me that with social distancing the maximum permitted number of people in their shops at any given moment has been reduced by 95 % maybe that falls to 60 % or 70 % with mask wearing 1 m but it still means most of their outlets are kaput so when the pm urges you to do so put on a face mask go down the local drink a couple of lemonade shandies and try to forget that the humungous bill for this epidemic has yet to arrive or even be totted up matt hancock is leading the government 's daily coronavirus press conference the health secretary is speaking alongside england 's deputy chief medical officer dr jenny harries the pair are speaking following a meeting between boris johnson senior cabinet members and top advisers who have been deciding whether to reduce the two metre social distancing rule to one how will pm choose between the joy of six and double bubble biggest spike in coronavirus cases worldwide over weekend some spaniards have concerns with uk covid-19 rates the prime minister is set to reveal his decision tomorrow in the house of commons he 'll also unveil his plan to reopen the hospitality sector from july 4 despite the uk easing its lockdown as the prevalence of coronavirus in britain goes down monday saw the largest worldwide daily increases yet in coronavirus cases over the weekend with more than 183,000 cases in 24 hours video report by itv news health correspondent emily morgan those shielding from coronavirus in england will be allowed to meet other people outdoors in groups of up to six from july 6 the health secretary has announced shielders who live alone or are single parents with children will also be able to create a support bubble with one other household of any size the same rule is already in place for the wider population the government 's shielding support package which delivers food and medicine will remain in place during this period to give people time to adjust to the changes england 's 2.2 million shielders those considered clinically extremely vulnerable to covid-19 must follow this guidance until the end of july after which people will no longer be asked to shield from august 1 the advice will be relaxed but shielders will retain their priority for supermarket delivery slots and still be able to access help with shopping medication phone calls and transport to medical appointments support will also remain available from nhs volunteers and local councils biggest spike in coronavirus cases worldwide over weekend those who need to work and can not do so from home will be advised to return to work from august 1 so long as their workplace is covid secure children who are clinically extremely vulnerable will be able return to their education settings from this point if they are eligible from this date food and medicine boxes being delivered through the national shielding service will stop as shielders will be advised they can visit shops and pharmacies the changes have been made following the reduction of the uk 's covid-19 alert level from four to three shielders are still advised to follow strict social distancing measures and should continue to frequently wash their hands england 's deputy chief medical officer dr jenny harries said health experts will continue to monitor the evidence around coronavirus transmission and will adjust the advice accordingly if worrying trends emerge england 's health secretary matt hancock said he wanted to thank all those who have been shielding acknowledging how the period will have been incredibly tough shielding has involved not leaving your house for months not seeing people you care about not being able to wander to the park for some fresh air or even pop to the shops for something you need he said this sacrifice has been for a purpose and i want to thank every single one of you itv news health correspondent emily morgan on why many are still concerned about the change in guidelines shielders are still advised to remain at home as much as possible despite the evidence showing on average less than 1 in 1,700 in our communities are estimated to have the virus down from 1 in 500 four weeks ago the government says shielding advice will only be paused at the start of august rather than stopped entirely because ministers anticipate introducing local shielding advice if there are local flare ups of the virus but dr harries says new risk assessment research methodology which is being published on monday could mean that in future a slightly different group may be advised to shield one group where this is particularly relevant is for children she said she said hospital admissions for under-18s with coronavirus is very low indeed and only 36 children within the uk have been admitted to intensive care said there were children who were staying home from school because they are shielding who would would be better off in the classroom there is almost certainly a large number a very large number of children who are not going to school at the moment who could go because parents are concerned that they should be shielding dr harries said what are the changes to the government 's shielding guidelines englands deputy chief medical officer told the downing street press conference that children with asthma which is under control should be in school those children are at very very low risk from covid they are probably at very very significant risk of getting left behind in their education in terms of the long term health outcomes that would be far worse how will pm choose between the joy of six and double bubble some spaniards ' slightly concerned by uk covid-19 rates what is dexamethasone and how does it work the government says it recognises the anxiety felt by many shielders about their return to work and has ordered employers to ensure robust measures are put in place to protect them from risk in a further bid to reassure shielders communities secretary robert jenrick said we will continueto deliver the unprecedented package ofsupportincluding food and medicine deliveriesuntil the end of july mr jenrick said the government will be writing to everyone on the shielded patient list with updated information on shielding advice and the ongoing support available to them but many are still concerned kate osborn who is a secondary school teacher told itv news she is very worried and fears she could die it sounds dramatic but if i was going to work going out and about i think i would catch it and i would die she said the idea that we 'll go from in our homes not having any contact not even people in our gardens you 're the first human in my garden to being with people who are used to it there 's no transition people have had four months to get to where they are now we have n't had any of those transitions so it 's a big worry we do n't even know how to socially distance sophie clarke is shielding due to cystic fibrosis and a double lung transplant putting her in the extremely vulnerable category the 25-year old is very wary about any stopping of the shielding advice but is cautiously pleased that advice for shielders will be relaxed she said if i want to see these particular friends it 's worth seeing them because i want to say happy really when asked whether she would choose them carefully she said i will pick them very carefully if i know that they 've been going to town or seeing lots of people i will be a bit hesitant about seeing them she adds that she feels totally abandoned by government and trusts her hospital guidance over the announcements from early in the crisis those considered clinically vulnerable have been advised to shield themselves from the virus by avoid all non - essential contact with people from outside their household we knew it was a difficult ask but these measures have been vital in saving lives mr hancock said now with infection rates continuing to fall in our communities our medical experts have advised that we can now ease some of these measures while keeping people safe the prime minister has offered his support to embattled housing secretary robert jenrick saying he still has full confidence in the minister despite a row over his controversial decision to award a development project to tory donor richard desmond opposition mps have been calling for mr jenrick to resign saying he broke the ministerial code when he overruled a planning inspector to approve an application made by mr desmond to build the westferry printworks redevelopment scheme in east london mr jenrick made the decision after sitting next to media mogul mr desmond at a tory fundraising event and being shown about three or four minutes of promotional video about the project according to mr desmond after watching the video mr jenrick told him sorry richard i ca nt discuss it the cabinet minister then granted permission for the 1,500-flat development the day before a new council community levy would have cost mr desmonds company an extra 40 million the decision was later reversed after legal action by tower hamlets council and mr jenrick admitted what he did was unlawful by reason of apparent bias how will pm choose between the joy of six and double bubble jenrick accused of unlawfully approving tory donor 's bid to build 1,500 houses following a sunday times investigation which revealed mr jenrick had got the gist of the project after been shown the video at the november fundraiser the prime minister 's spokesman was again asked about the issue downing street attempted to distance itself from the row with the spokesman telling reporters no one in no 10 has discussed this with mr desmond or the applicant no 10 has no involvement with the secretary of states appeal decision asked whether no 10 knew mr jenrick had watched the promotional video during a fundraising dinner the spokesman said what the communities secretary has said is that he is confident that all the rules were followed in taking the decision and he has rejected the suggestion that there was any actual bias in the decision mr jenrick has said he did not discuss the development at the westferry printworks in east london with mr desmond and has told mps he acted in good faith and within the rules what is dexamethasone and how does it work coronavirus everything you need to know about air bridges pm to reveal next steps for coronavirus lockdown on tuesday cabinet secretary sir mark sedwill has been tasked with carrying out a review into the handling of the development mr desmond who used to own the express and star newspapers told the sunday times what i did was i showed him the video adding that the minister viewed it for about three or four minutes at the november fundraiser two weeks after the cabinet minister stepped in to approve the housing scheme electoral commission records show that mr desmond personally gave 12,000 to the conservatives mr desmond told the sunday times he was paying for the price of his ticket to the event by making the donation former channel 5 owner mr desmond has donated to both the tories and ukip in the past here are the outstanding questions to be taken by the prime minister and the coronavirus strategy committee he chairs cs today about how far lockdown will be eased on july 4 and thereafter first on socialising inside where we live will we be allowed to meet with anyone we like indoors in groups of up to half a dozen or will we be restricted to socialising with a single family or household of our choice with whom we would form a long term bubble this is a choice between a rule more likely to be actually followed namely the permission to mix with whomever we like so long as there are no more than six of us versus a rule that the scientists believe is more likely to reduce the risk that the rate of viral transmission will increase dangerously again to put this in a nutshell if the british people are now largely in a mindset to bend whatever rule is being set and post the barnard castle eye test they probably are is it better to have a rule that is intrinsically more likely to limit viral transmission than one that starts off being risky ish and becomes very risky when bent if that is how boris johnson frames the decision and i would expect it will be then he will go for the two household bubble second will indoor gyms and campsites be allowed to open because of the risk of transmission of the virus in shared shower facilities inter alia i have n't a clue where this argument will end up pm to reveal next steps for coronavirus lockdown on tuesday biggest spike in coronavirus cases worldwide over weekend doctors ' not confident nhs can cope in event of second spike third when we go to a pub or restaurant will we be compelled to leave our name and contact details at the door so that we can be contacted pronto if a flare up of infections appears to be linked to that pub or restaurant my hunch is we will be compelled to provide those contact details every time we go out for a drink or meal however incongruous that may feel because without that information the risk would increase that the test and trace system will lack the data to enforce very localised lockdowns as and when the virus surges the point is that the economic cost of resumed national or even regional lockdowns as opposed to ones affecting smaller localities look prohibitively large based on what we have experienced so far or to put it another way registering to have a pint seems a relatively small price to pay as insurance we wo n't all be locked in our homes again on all of this there is an apparent tension between virus prophylaxis on the one hand taking the necessary steps to minimise the risk that a new covid-19 flare up will wreak widespread havoc versus giving us back more of our social and economic freedoms sooner rather than later but the tension is not as unambiguous as it seems in the end it is a tricky judgement about what freedoms to give us back now that do n't maximise the risk that within a few months they 'll have to be snatched back again boris johnson has said he will unveil his plan for the future of the two metre rule this week the prime minister added he is sticking like glue to his road map for easing the coronavirus lockdown for the hospitality sector from july 4 which includes pubs and restaurants with the two metre rule placing severe constraints on the hospitality sector it looks increasingly likely to be reduced as long as other mitigations such as face coverings can be used to help prevent a second wave of covid-19 infections ministers believe that cases of coronavirus are sufficiently low after three months of lockdown that a greater reopening can take place in order to revive the ailing economy half of doctors ' not confident nhs can cope in event of virus second spike in a downing street interview the prime minister said the disease is increasingly under control and i just want people to reflect on that important fact its going down we are getting it down so of course as we make that progress it will be possible to open up more and you will be hearing more about what we want to do with not just non - essential retail but with the hospitality sector from july 4 and were sticking absolutely like glue to the road map to the plan that i set out on may 10 but its very important we do nt lose our vice like grip on the disease we ve got to keep it on the floor where we ve got it on the progress on social distancing watch this space and you wo nt have much more to wait now you ll certainly be hearing more this week coronavirus chancellor hints two metre rule will be relaxed in pms review earlier on sunday matt hancock said england is clearly on track to further ease the coronavirus lockdown with the hope pubs restaurants and hairdressers could reopen as early as july 4 the health secretary promised the next steps would be set out this week along with any alteration to the two metre social distancing guidance he told skys sophy ridge on sunday were clearly on track for that plan because of the number of cases coming down and the plan does refer to hospitality and some of the other things that are closed that so many people want to see open acknowledging that a lot of the country does need a haircut he said that he is not going to rule out hairdressers and barbers also being able to reopen on july 4 later on the andrew marr show he said the government will announce the results of a review into the two metre rule and the next step for the lockdown this week i think we are about to see another step in the plan and this week we will announce further details of the measures that we can take to relieve some of the national lockdown measures at the start of july including on july 4 he said on the bbc programme were going to set out those details absolutely this week he gave perspex screens masks and altered seating arrangements as examples of measures to mitigate the risk of spreading coronavirus if the two metre rule is changed and he floated the idea that punters at pubs and bars could have to sign a guest book with their names and contact details so they could be swiftly traced if they come into contact with an infection shadow health secretary jonathan ashworth said labour would support a reduction of the two metre rule under certain circumstances including the strengthening of other protections such as masks hotels are also awaiting the go ahead to reopen and revive the chance of holidays within the uk and boost the economy to aid the recovery mr hancock did not rule out suggestions that rishi sunak could slash vat to encourage spending telling ridge its very much a matter for the chancellor the health secretary also said a reduction in the distance rule would undoubtedly help with schools pointing to northern ireland where it will be reduced to one metre later tonight in tulsa oklahoma tens of thousands of people will congregate in americas biggest breach of social distancing since the pandemic began it is the first trump rally in post - lockdown america or more accurately given the infection statistics the first election rally in mid - pandemic america donald trump 's poised to resume his inflammatory rallies but is tulsa a provocation too far facebook removes trump adverts over nazi symbol it is certainly drawing curiosity the white house claims that one million people have applied for tickets already a large crowd has gathered in tulsa and the national guard are on the streets to try and keep order nigel farage has tweeted this morning suggesting he will be there but its much more than a health risk the rally is being seen by the presidents critics as a provocation it was originally scheduled for yesterday a date known in america as juneteenth that s the day when many people mark the end of slavery and remember its devastating human toll president trump delayed it by 24 hours so it will go ahead tonight instead but that has not removed the sense that he is trying to exploit the current racial and political tensions for tulsa has a special place in 20th century american history for all the wrong reasons in 1921 it was the scene of one of the most shocking acts of racial violence ever to take place in america a white mob killed hundreds of african americans in a paroxysm of violence to add to the ominous atmosphere trump tweeted out yesterday what appears to have been a direct threat to protesters so you can see the problem a historically significant date a location that represents horror for black americans a moment of current racial tension a pandemic and a threat from the sitting president trumps critics have launched a new ad ahead of his tulsa rally we have just twenty weeks to go before the presidential election donald trump is restless in the white house he has been defeated in recent supreme court judgments and ridiculed in a book about to be published by john bolton his former national security adviser for the president this is also about contrasting this mega - rally with the small cautious socially distanced events organised by his rival joe biden trump has told the wall street journal that tulsa will be one hell of a night lets hope its not more than that lets hope its a rally not a riot that its about politics not race video report by itv news political correspondent carl dinnen the two metre social distancing rule in england looks set to be relaxed after chancellor rishi sunak said the prime ministers review will make an enormous difference to businesses boris johnson is expected to make an announcement next week on pubs cafes restaurants and hotels with their reopening in england an ambition from july 4 to start reviving the economy he is under pressure from leaders of the hospitality sector and his own mps to lessen the two metre rule which aims to slow the spread of covid-19 but places major constraints on businesses after the uk 's coronavirus alert level was lowered from four to three mr johnson dropped a big hint that the two metre rule would also soon be reduced when he said watch this space on friday minister plots ' nightingale courts ' to tackle covid-19 court case backlog police hope to avoid violence as blm protests go on for fourth weekend u turns car crashes schools and lost covid generation the result of the pms review is expected this week but the chancellor strongly signalled it will allow the government to ease the measure in england the outcome of that review will be announced this week obviously that s something that will make an enormous difference i think to many businesses who are keen to see a change he told reporters during a visit to shops in north yorkshire obviously we need to go through that review but i m very understanding of the calls for action on that particularly for our hospitality industry for our pubs for our restaurants they are keen to see if there s some change that can be made there many pubs have been coming up with innovative ways to serve alcohol while sticking to the lockdown rules but they say their premises are too small for a full reopening without a reduction in the rule guidance drawn up by the sector and ministers is understood to encourage pub goers to order drinks using phone apps instead of going to the bar while current legislation was said to include the powers for patrols the uk hospitality trade body said draft guidance allowed a degree of flexibility over menus being discarded after every use and for cutlery only to be brought out with food chief executive kate nicholls told bbc radio 4s today programme the idea was for individual businesses to draw up their own plans to keep their team and guests safe pubs left in limbo over july opening date boris johnson told pub chain and insurance giant apologise for slavery links as the guidelines cover from a burger van in a park right the way through to the fat duck in bray you need to have something that takes account of everything in between rather than a one size fits all she added it was stressed that decisions on further easing were yet to be made but the pm has said the lowering of the alert level from four to three allows ministers to start making some progress on social distancing measures and he promised new guidance for the hospitality sector and businesses very shortly one expert informing the governments response to the pandemic as part of the scientific advisory group for emergencies sage said he had revised his opposition to reducing the two metre rule now transmission is low the university of liverpools professor calum semple told today i m still saying two metres is safer than one but in my opinion it is now a reasonable political decision to relax these rules he said he could envisage going down to one metre with various caveats and other precautions in order to reopen society the downgrading of the alert level by the uks chief medical officers including professor chris whitty means transmission of coronavirus is no longer considered to be high or rising exponentially localised outbreaks of covid-19 are still likely to occur the advisers warned and the virus remains in general circulation the move was welcomed by portugals ambassador to london who said the nation would like to form a so called air bridge with the uk to give an exemption to quarantine measures to make foreign holidays possible manuel lobo antunes told today we think that the situation is under control and we would be happy to receive as before as many british as possible on friday mr johnson told the public to watch this space when asked whether the distance restriction could be reduced to help schools in england return in autumn government scientific advisers have said they would be comfortable with a reduced distance if risk mitigating measures were taken such as people sitting side by side and wearing face coverings the pm also said it is his intention that children of all ages in england should be able to return to school on a five days a week basis in september education secretary gavin williamson suggested that primary school class sizes of 15 known as bubbles could be expanded back to their normal size to allow more children back in the classroom in wales first minister mark drakeford was planning to end its five mile restriction on travel next month and allow holidaymakers to return a week later and in northern ireland most pupils are set for a return to education in the autumn after ministers agreed to cut the social distancing measure to one metre the government is planning to set up nightingale courts to try and reduce some of the backlog of court cases built up during the coronavirus crisis while there were hundreds of thousands of cases already on court waiting lists the pandemic has made the situation much worse with justice secretary robert buckland expecting the backlog to run into next year by the end of may there were more than 40,500 cases waiting to be dealt with by crown courts in england and wales up from 37,434 on december 31 according to figures released by the criminal bar association cba the logjam in magistrates courts increased even more dramatically over lockdown with 483,678 cases waiting to be dealt with by may 17 up from 395,606 on march 22 the cba believes these will later add to the waiting piles in crown courts as the cases make their way through the criminal justice system the caseload has increased somewhat and we need to eat into that and that will take quite a few months this year and next year the justice secretary told bbc radio 4 all we want is sacoolas to come back harry dunns parents await court battle every person prosecuted under new coronavirus act was wrongly charged he said work was work was going on apace to set up nightingale courts which just like their hospital counterparts will be converted from regular buildings to help reduce pressure elsewhere in the sector mr buckland said he would have to use every tool in the book in order to deliver swift justice courts are stuck between a rock and an impossible place as tens of thousands of cases continue to build up after hearings were halted by coronavirus an industry body has warned their analysis of courts and tribunals service hmcts figures comes as one trial for an alleged crime in july 2019 will not reach trial until december 2021 at the earliest the case scheduled for a crown court in london could be pushed back yet further to 2022 all trials were halted in england and wales on march 23 and some began to resume last month a spokesman for the cba described judges and listing officers as caught between a rock and an impossible place with courts still remaining largely closed and the backlog growing week by week the authority say the build up has been growing for some years and in crown courts waiting lists are now up 22 % on 31 december 2018 cases are taking longer to make their way through the

australia deports british murderer the chair of the cba has called for greater investment and claims that the body consistently warned that the move back to court in particular trials would be slow and cautious following lockdown caroline goodwin qc said its very simple to cut the backlog and to stop this excruciating delay we need treasury to step up to the plate treasury must pay to allow all available court buildings to be used and all available judges to preside over hearings and when that is done utilise more buildings and set the recorders part time judges to work alongside the judges jury trials have resumed and that is a huge step forward of which we should be proud but only for now in a limited number of courts she added being serious about law and order while ensuring the innocent do nt suffer miscarriages of justice means being serious about the billions of investment needed now across the board a hmcts spokesperson said we have worked closely with the judiciary to safely continue thousands of hearings during the pandemic this includes prioritising urgent cases such as those involving domestic abuse swiftly increasing our capacity to hear cases remotely and resuming jury trials so that justice can continue to be done this data reflects the unprecedented circumstances facing the court system and we will continue to work on further measures to ensure justice is delivered video report by itv news correspondent juliet bremner class size limits imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus could be expanded to allow every child to return to school a minister said prime minister boris johnson has said his intention is that children of all ages in england should be able to return to school five days a week in september under government guidance primary school class sizes should be limited to 15 to minimise the number of people they come into contact with but education secretary gavin williamson told the daily downing street briefing on friday that these so called bubbles could be expanded to include the whole class he added we ve been creating bubbles of children in the classroom creating a protective environment for those children the education secretary was speaking after the prime minister announced 1 billion plan to give tuition to children who have missed education due to the coronavirus lockdown three and easing pm says watch this space as uk alert level drops currently that is at 15 what we would be looking at doing is expanding those bubbles to include the whole class mr williamson said signs the virus was reducing meant ministers could look at making sure every child returns to school he added we recognise there is still going to have to be protective measures put in place to make sure children are safe and make sure that teachers and all those who work in school are safe as well and that is why we are going to be issuing further guidance in the next two weeks while class sizes vary these bubbles could contain up to 30 pupils children in nursery reception year 1 and year 6 in england began returning to primary school at the beginning of this month after the government eased lockdown measures department for education dfe guidance said that primary school classes should be split in half and contain no fewer than 15 pupils desks should be spaced as far apart as possible and lunch break drop off and pick up times should be staggered schools should also consider introducing one way circulation or placing a divider down the middle of the corridor to keep young people apart it added but some schools have said they did not have enough space on site to admit all pupils in the eligible year groups while adhering to government guidance to limit class sizes and encourage fewer interactions as a way to mitigate the time lost to lockdown the pm is introducing a scheme which will see the most disadvantaged children in england given access to funds to pay for personal tutors mr johnson been vocal about his desire to have all children back in school as soon as possible and was forced to make a u - turn earlier in the crisis after initially aiming for all primary school children to return for a month before the summer holiday mr johnson said last week that school pupils would undergo a massive catch up operation over the summer and beyond to get up to speed on work they have missed with thousands of youngsters having been out of class since march but he is determined no more education time will be lost after the summer holidays provided we can make the classrooms safe and i think we can i want every child every pupil every student back in september and i 'm sure we can get it done he said three and easing pm says watch this space as uk alert level drops johnson reveals

why we will bring all children in all year groups back to school in september while many children have already returned to school i do understand that there is anxiety still among parents i want to assure you that the wellbeing of your children is the absolute top priority for every single one of us watch the press conference in full video report by itv news health correspondent emily morgan the prime minister has indicated lockdown restrictions will be eased as the science allows after reducing the uk 's coronavirus alert level 4 to 3 boris johnson speaking after department for health confirmed the change had been made following a recommendation from experts said watch this space when asked whether social distancing for school children could be reduced in line with the alert level his comments came as the rate of spread of the coronavirus infection across the uk is shrinking according to new figures published by the government on friday for the uk as a whole the current growth rate is minus 4 % to minus 2 % and the estimate of the reproduction number referred to as r remains at 0.7 to 0.9 although it has fallen slightly in england from 0.7 - 1 last week to 0.7 0.9 the chief medical officers of england scotland wales and northern ireland all recommended the level be reduced following a steady decrease in covid-19 cases all nations of the uk except england have announced lockdown changes which follow the reduced risk levels northern ireland is reducing its two metre social distancing rule to one in schools wales is opening non - essential retail from monday nicola sturgeon announced a change allowing members of three household groups to meet at the same time outdoors mr johnson said on the social distancing measures as i 've said watch this space we will be putting in further changes as the science allows coronavirus borrowing hits record 55.2bn high in may as uk debt mountain soars above gdp for first time since 1960s boris johnson reveals 1bn plan to help pupils catch up after lockdown he added as the alert level comes down that will allow us to start making some progress as i 've said on our plan and with the social distancing measures so when we go forward to july 4 which is the next big stage in the plan we hope that there will be more guidance out very very shortly that will help people help businesses help hospitality to prepare for that health secretary matt hancock described the alert level lowering as a big moment for the country shadow health secretary jon ashworth welcomed the change saying we 're obviously passed the peak of the virus but warned there 's no room for complacency this remains a very serious deadly virus it remains a virus which spreads with speed what does this mean in practice a reduction from level 4 to level 3 means coronavirus is deemed less of a threat to the uk public the definition of level 4 which was the previous level across the country says coronavirus transmission is high or rising exponentially level 3 's warning simply states that the covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation in practical terms this means there is a gradual relaxation of restrictions from level 4 we are seeing such moves being implemented in the four nations with non - essential shops having already reopened or with plans to reopen there has also been a slight relaxation of measures which means people can see family and loved ones and there are plans in england to possibly open pubs restaurants and leisure facilities like gyms and swimming pools in early july what are the alert levels the coronavirus alert system has been put in place by the uk government to signify the threat to the country posed by the disease there are five levels in the uk coronavirus alert system with level five being the highest threat and level one being the lowest the government 's definition of the five levels are level 1 covid-19 is not known to be present in the uk level 2 covid-19 is present in the uk but the number of cases and transmission is low level 3 a covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation level 4 a covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation transmission is high or rising exponentially level 5 as level 4 and there is a material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed has the r number changed and what is the growth rate the national r number remains unchanged from last week at 0.7 0.9 although it has gone down marginally in england from 0.7 - 1 last week to 0.7 0.9 on friday sage released growth rate figures for the first time the growth rate reflects how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day as the number of infections decreases the growth rate is another way of keeping track of the virus the current growth rate for the uk as a whole is % to % the government says if the growth rate is greater than zero and therefore positive then the disease will grow if the growth rate is less than zero then the disease will shrink it is an approximation of the change in the number of infections each day and the size of the growth rate indicates the speed of change r estimates do not indicate how quickly an epidemic is changing and different diseases with the same r can result in epidemics that grow at very different speeds growth rates provide different information from r estimates but neither measure r or growth rate is better than the other each provides information that is useful in monitoring the spread of a disease level change ' big moment for uk health secretary matt hancock said the uk moving to a lower alert level is a big moment for the country and a real testament to the british peoples determination to beat this virus the governments plan is working infection rates are rapidly falling we have protected the nhs and thanks to the hard work of millions in our health and social care services we are getting the country back on her feet the level change comes following a recommendation from the chief medical officers of england scotland wales and northern ireland in a joint statement they said there has been a steady decrease in cases we have seen in all four nations and this continues it does not mean that the pandemic is over the virus is still in general circulation and localised outbreaks are likely to occur we have made progress against the virus thanks to the efforts of the public and we need the public to continue to follow the guidelines carefully to ensure this progress continues labour 's jon ashworth said we really need the tracking and the testing capacity in place to ensure officials can keep the virus suppressed he added how people must still follow the social distancing rules and wear face masks where appropriate we simply can not take our foot off the gas we can not be complacent this still remains very serious the relaxation of measures comes after the office for national statistics revealed on thursday there had been a significant decrease in the number of people currently infected with coronavirus across the uk they said an average of 33,000 people in private households had the disease at any given point between may 31 and june 13 which is the equivalent of 0.06 % of the total population or around one in 1,700 people the ons said this was a clear decrease from the average of 149,000 people infected between may 3 and may 16 which was the equivalent of 0.27 % of the

april following heavy spending in the face of coronavirus according to new figures the office for national statistics ons added that public sector borrowing excluding banks owned by the state was nearly nine times higher than the levels in may 2019 it means the uks debt mountain has also now grown to more than the entire countrys output gross domestic product for the first time since 1963 officials added to 1.95 trillion or 100.9 % of gdp boris johnson admitted there would be some difficult times ahead but said he believes the british public understand that they can see there 's been a huge economic cost to what has happened there 's been a massive lack of economic activity for a very long time of course that 's going to be painful and expensive to make up but we 're a very creative very dynamic society we will come back he added he said in the next few weeks there will be updates from him and the chancellor about how we want to bounce forward april was previously thought to be the all time highest borrowing month since records began in 1993 coming in at 62.1 billion but officials on friday revised this down by 13.6 billion due to larger than expected tax and national insurance contributions and lower costs associated with the coronavirus job retention scheme the furlough scheme is expected to cost the treasury 60 billion by the time it closes in october according to the office for budget responsibility obr borrowing in the current financial year to date which is april and may is estimated to have been 103.7 billion up 87 billion on the same period a year ago

pointing in the wrong direction number of uk workers on payroll falls by more than 600,000 the amount of cash needed by the government in may was also a record high at 62.7 billion with 126.2 billion required in just april and may combined the ons added interest payments on the debts were 3.3 billion in may up 0.2 billion from may 2019 as the amounts are linked to inflation the increase in borrowing came because central government receipts fell 28.4 % compared to may a year ago at 40.7 billion including 28.9 billion in taxes value added tax vat pay as you earn paye income tax and corporation tax receipts fell by 46 % 29.4 % and 14 % respectively the ons said although officials were keen to stress the numbers could change when actual cash data is received chancellor rishi sunak said todays figures confirm that coronavirus is having a severe impact on our public finances the best way to restore our public finances to a more sustainable footing is to safely reopen our economy

shops will be allowed to welcome customers as long as they can take all reasonable measures to keep to the two metre distancing rule unlike in england where shops have been trading since monday social distancing is written into law in wales and compels all employers to make provisions for their workers to keep two metres apart on thursday health minister vaughan gething told the governments daily press briefing he did not want to see a repeat of scenes in england where crowds of people were pictured standing close together outside stores he said i do nt want to see a repeat of crowds bunched together outside shops in complete breach of what social distancing guidance is supposed to deliver i do nt want to see workers put at risk i do nt want to see shoppers put at risk people in scotland living on their own will be able to form extended household groups ' as further restrictions eased thousands queue across the country as shops in england reopen for first time since march lockdown the welsh government says the change is part of the most comprehensive package of measures announced in wales yet to further unlock the coronavirus restrictions and moves many areas of activity into the amber zone of its lockdown traffic light system but the countrys five mile travel rule will remain unchanged for now following cabinet discussions this week though a further review on it is expected by july 6 plaid cymrus shadow health minister rhun ap iorwerth ms said though the announcement on shops was welcome more clarity was needed on what else could be lifted in the months ahead he said three weeks ago the first minister asked non - essential shops to prepare to reopen safely what we need to know now is which businesses and which sectors will be given guidance next to prepare for safe reopening in three weeks time i m calling on the first minister to relax restrictions as fast and as safely as possible and to consistently test and challenge the decisions they take as we move towards a new normality secretary of state for wales simon hart said mr drakeford needed to provide the tourism industry with certainty and a plan by giving a timetable when their businesses could resume he said the first minister had spooked the industry by saying tourism would be likely to be restricted to self contained accommodation such as cottages and holiday homes until next year mr hart told the pa news agency if that was serious that would mean they would have to start laying off straight away what businesses are saying to us is they ve had no income since last october let alone since march and were unlikely to have money anytime soon they want to hear from the welsh government exactly what its thoughts are around tourism and leisure and to give if they can an indication of what the sort of timescales are likely to be he added i m the first person to absolutely accept that the science is the science and you need to tread carefully with that but its perfectly possible for them to give as the uk government gave an indication of what the plan looks like everyone is grown up enough to know that it can change but if businesses are going to be able to make any money in this year at all they need to be able to start planning for that now coronavirus everything you need to know check the number of cases in your area with our interactive map listen and subscribe to our

have been blamed for labour 's most recent general election failings labour together a group including mps ed miliband and lucy powell party members union figures and people from the media examined the defeat it said was a long time coming the group 's report sets out political organisational and digital failures which resulted in labour 's worst general election performance since 1935 while trying to chart the party 's path back to power starmer suggests swapping places with johnson at pmqs after criticising covid-19 response labour urges government to bring forward aviation rescue deal to save jobs boris johnson reveals 1bn plan to help pupils catch up after lockdown the party warned it has a mountain to climb to win the next election and that sir keir starmer 's leadership wo n't be enough to catapult labour into number 10 the report said under mr corbyn labour was unprepared for a general election had no clear message and its manifesto pledges were seen as impossible to deliver by the public it added there is a broad consensus across the party mirrored in the results from the survey of labour members that a combination of concerns about the leadership labours position on brexit and labours manifesto not being seen as deliverable damaged labours chances in the election the commission concludes that the weaknesses going into this election were interlinked and indivisible they catalysed long term trends between labour and its voter coalition the report also warned that making sir keir starmer leader would not be enough to help them win the next general election unless underlying issues from the previous leadership including anti - semitism were not addressed concerns about labours leadership were a significant factor in the election loss in 2019 the report said stop jeremy corbyn was a major driver of the conservatives success across all their key groups including previous non - voters and among all the swing voters labour lost to the tories the very low poll ratings on leadership going into the 2019 election can not easily be disentangled from the handling of issues like brexit party disunity and anti - semitism it urged different factions within the party to unite in order to stand a chance against the conservatives lack of planning was also cited saying the party lacked a clear strategy of which voters we needed to persuade or how labour was also outperformed on both traditional and social media with research for the review showing the conservatives invested heavily in digital and had far more success with organic shares of their messaging while making much better use of facebook groups and other online forums by comparison labour activists were plagued by crashing digital tools that created more work not less for candidates and campaign teams and by a lack of best practice messaging the review also showed labour lost many voters due to brexit with more deserting the party before the referendum than in last years election among recommendations the group called for a coherent strategy to build a winning coalition at the next election and a renewed commitment to transformational economic change in britain rooted in a credible understanding in the struggles of peoples lives the report said labour should build a culture of inclusion and diversity generosity and teamwork not factionalism and patronage in the party it also called for a root and branch reform of our party organisation and structures bringing it into the 2020s so it connects better to the communities and voters that we seek to serve including a wholesale transformation of our digital and online campaigning the prime minister has said every child should be back in school by september following the announcement of a 1 billion plan to help pupils in england catch up with their education after losing months to the coronavirus lockdown boris johnson has been vocal about his desire to have all children back in school as soon as possible and was forced to make a u - turn earlier in the crisis after initially aiming for all primary school children to return for a month before the summer holiday as a way to mitigate the time lost to lockdown the pm is introducing a scheme which will see the most disadvantaged children in england given access to funds to pay for personal tutors the majority of the funding will allow schools to step in to cover lost teaching time mr johnson said last week that school pupils would undergo a massive catch up operation over the summer and beyond to get up to speed on work they have missed with thousands of youngsters having been out of class since march but he is determined no more education time will be lost after the summer holidays provided we can make the classrooms safe and i think we can i want every child every pupil every student back in september and i 'm sure we can get it done he said he added we 've got to start thinking of a world in which we are less apprehensive about this disease no date for new virus app as hancock puts blame on apple coronavirus contact tracing app what has changed and why is it taking so long on the fresh wave of summer funding mr johnson admitted the funds are broken down allowing schools to decide exactly what they want to spend on what their priority is he went on the thing that i think really matters is to get some more direct tuition some one to one tuition for pupils pupils who need remedial help perhaps who really need help because they 've lost time to learn over the last few months but then also for kids who have promise but who do n't normally get it and this is one of the things i think we really want to develop as a government the idea of really helping schools to give direct focus the prime minister said he would not force schools to give all children tuition instead he will give them the tools to give more help where they think that is appropriate around 650 m of funding will go to state primary and secondary schools and the remaining 350 m will go on a national tutoring programme for disadvantaged children the money will mean the most disadvantaged children will have access to tutors through a 350 million national programme for the 2020/21 academic year to prevent the attainment gap from widening further a further 650 million will be shared across state primary and secondary schools over the 2020 - 21 academic year to help children from all backgrounds who have lost teaching time the department for education said while head teachers will decide how the money is spent the government expects it to be used for small group tuition for whoever needs it the announcement comes after ministers were put under pressure to get children back to school amid concerns about the damage being caused to pupils attainment and wellbeing children in nursery reception year 1 and year 6 have begun returning to primary school in england and some year 10 and 12 pupils returned to secondary school and college this week but all pupils are not due to return to school until at least september after the government was forced to abandon plans to get all primary school children back in class before the summer break controversy is also brewing about exam results after the i newspaper reported that millions of gcse and a level grades are due to be marked down because of generous predictions made by teachers as a result of exams being scrapped during the pandemic in northern ireland most pupils are set for a return to full time education in the autumn after ministers agreed to cut the social distancing measure to one metre but health secretary matt hancock speaking at the daily downing street briefing said the same would not happen in england until the virus was under control the government on thursday was forced into an embarrassing u - turn over its tracing app announcing that it was ditching ambitions to develop its own software and instead will work with tech giants apple and google on a new improved design mr hancock told the daily briefing that developers had been working on both the app created by the nhss digital arm nhsx and the design offered by apple and google since may but the nhsx app had hit a technical barrier during testing on the isle of wight having previously promised the tracing app would be rolled out in mid - may mr hancock refused to put a date on when the new software would be ready officials at an earlier briefing said they hoped an app will be ready by the autumn winter flu season a crucial point when many

across the four nations lift the department of transport wants to encourage more people off public transport and onto greener alternatives like e - scooters the government will soon be trialling e scooter hire schemes around the country but are e - scooters legal yes electric scooters are legal to own and ride but only on private land so if you 're using them on a public road that is an offence and you can be fined or receive points on a driving licence calls for stricter road safety laws as e - scooters reach 50 mph e - scooters where is it legal and illegal to ride how will the e scooter rental trial work before the government can decide whether to fully legalise e - scooters and figure out the rules that should apply to them such as will you need a licence the government is going to start trialing e scooter hire schemes in a few areas around the country in order to understand their impacts however you 'll only be able to use the rental e scooters in these areas not your own are e - scooters safe electric scooters can reach speeds of over 30 mph most are limited to around 15 mph but there are concerns around the safety of their designs dr adam snow from liverpool john moores university said the government needs to get to grips with manufacturing and authorisation of safely designed scooters present there are no appropriate safeguards on the design and critical safety features shock absorption wheel and tyre design safe braking systems et cetera some e - scooters only have single brakes and the parliamentary advisory council for transport safety pacts believe the design of many hire e - scooters such as small wheels and narrow handlebars makes them inherently unsafe especially when navigating busy roads itv news investigation finds retailers encouraging e - scooters to be illegally ridden on roads tv presenter and youtube star emily hartridge dies in electric scooter accident are e scooter accidents common dr snow said in the largest study to date in the us it was estimated there would be approximately 22 road deaths per a hundred thousand population to put that into perspective in the uk that figure for all road deaths regardless of mode of travel is approximately three per hundred thousand he added it 's difficult to cross compare countries in the uk it is believed that there has only been one e scooter fatality but studies in denmark concluded that e scooter riders suffer much higher rates of head injury compared to cyclists because of their standing position which means they 're more likely to be thrown forward more quickly how can e - scooters be made safer dr snow said all the safety studies so far and there are n't that many suggest at the very least helmets should be mandatory and protective gear is a must but campaigners who want e - scooters on our roads say we have bigger safety concerns london cycling campaign 's tom bogdanowicz said the primary road danger to both e - scooters and cyclists are the larger vehicles lorries and cars and the best way of reducing that danger is by separating the small from the large he adds so we are likely to need many more of those cycle tracks cycle lanes that are popping up all over the country do e - scooters offer a greener solution to road travel london 's cycling campaign said there are several benefits to e - scooters mr bogdanowicz said the benefits of e - scooters to individuals are lower journey times and lower costs compared to cars he adds the benefits to the rest of us are better air quality less congestion and fewer carbon emissions which is why we support their legalisation but not everyone believes they 'll make a dent in the amount of cars on our roads dr snow said in terms of change of use from cars to e - scooters it 's unlikely to produce any great change in use because they are how or have limited functionality really where an e - scooter does the best are in those very short journeys from say home to the train station or short city hops the department of transport is yet to reveal the areas where the e scooter trials will take place but the announcement is expected within the next few weeks the uk has began producing what could be a vaccine for coronavirus despite the drug having no clinical approval the health secretary has announced matt hancock told the government 's daily coronavirus press conference that a deal had been struck between pharmaceutical company astrazeneca and oxford university to begin the manufacture of a potential vaccine they re starting manufacturing now even ahead of approval so we can build up a stock pile and be ready should it be clinically approved the health secretary said he said there will be sufficient supplies of the drug for those most in need should the science come off stockpiles of the recently approved coronavirus treatment dexamethasone were built up before it had approval mr hancock said efforts to develop uk 's own covid tracing app abandoned three u turns in a month starmer suggests swapping places with johnson 13-day old baby believed to be uk 's youngest coronavirus death priority will be given to front line health and social care workers and those at increased risk of serious disease and death from coronavirus he added that would include the over-50s and those with heart and kidney disease among those being considered for priority are those from ethnic minority backgrounds so we can protect the most at risk first should a vaccine become available our approach to vaccines is to throw everything at it as fast as we can and rigorously to test and make sure that they re safe before deployment the potential vaccine being developed by imperial college london is now in the first phase of human clinical trials the health secretary also announced he warned however how it is very important that we do nt fall behind on vaccinations for other diseases because of this crisis coronavirus contact tracing app what has changed and why is it taking so long he encouraged everyone to attend vaccination appointments should they be contacted by the nhs there was more good news at the briefing with an announcement that the uk 's death rate is back to normal mr hancock said for the first week since mid - march the number of people who died in this country in total from coronavirus and anything else was no higher than is normal at this time of year but as the health secretary pointed to government achievements he could not avoid talking about a very recent failure the government 's latest policy u - turn was the abandonment ofthe nhs track and trace app at the press conference the health secretary said he wanted to be upfront and open about the challenges faced by nhsx the tech wing of the nhs he said testing on the isle of wight uncovered a technical barrier for which he blamed apple we found that our app works well on android devices but apple software prevents iphones being used effectively for contact tracing unless you are using apples own technology he said he said that the nhsx app was better at measuring distance than the google / apple model as it stands our app wo nt work because apple wo nt change their system but it can measure distance and their app ca nt measure distance well enough to a standard that we are satisfied with the government had been trialling the app on the isle of wight from may 5 in anticipation for uk wide launch at a later date no date was being set for the roll out however despite mr hancock having previously said the it would be available in mid - may video report by itv news science editor tom clarke matt hancock could not say when a coronavirus contact tracing app would be rolled out as the health secretary blamed apple technology for being unable to release the governments own app speaking at the governments daily coronavirus press conference mr hancock defended the governments latest u - turn after they abandoned plans to develop their own coronavirus app in favour of switching to technology developed by apple and google however despite ditching its own plans to develop an app the government is still unable to say when any effective app will be ready to use one in four people with coronavirus missed by nhs tracing system why is nhs test and trace contacting only one in nine people infected with coronavirus mr hancock said were working on it were not going to put a date on it i m afraid because i m absolutely determined that whilst this technology can help its got to be working effectively but i am confident we will get there we will put that cherry on didos cake a coronavirus tracing app is seen as a key pillar to help easing lockdown restrictions as the technology could have the ability to alert people if they have been in contact with someone with covid-19 the government 's app which it was trialling on the isle of wight worked well on android devices but there was a technical barrier on iphones mr hancock said the initial launch date for an app was originally given as may. he said we found that our app works well on android devices but apple software prevents iphones being used effectively for contact tracing unless you are using apples own technology he said he said that the nhsx app was better at measuring distance than the google / apple model as it stands our app wo nt work because apple wo nt change their system but it can measure distance and their app ca nt measure distance well enough to a standard that we are satisfied with political editor robert peston on this latest government u - turn nhs test and trace chief baroness dido harding and nhs boss matthew gould said there had been specific technical challenges in setting up the app while the mr hancock said other countries across the world had also faced challenges in developing apps in a statement on the u - turn baroness harding and mr gould said our response to this virus has and will continue to be as part of an international effort that is why as part of a collaborative approach we have agreed to share our own innovative work on estimating distance between app users with google and apple work that we hope will benefit others while using their solution to address some of the specific technical challenges identified through our rigorous testing matt hancock denies government u - turn on free school meals and praises ' daniel rashford mr hancock said the government remained determined to develop an app which meets the technical security and user needs of the public he claimed that countries across the world had faced challenges in developing apps labours shadow health secretary jonathan ashworth said the app u turn meant precious time and money had been wasted he said this is unsurprising and yet another example of where the governments response has been slow and badly managed its meant precious time and money wasted for months tech experts warned ministers about the flaws in their app which is why we wrote to matt hancock encouraging the government to consider digital alternatives back in may. ministers must now urgently prioritise building a fully effective test trace and isolate regime led by local expertise to break the chains of transmission of this deadly virus bob seely the tory mp for the isle of wight where the government had been trialling their own tracing app said i want to thank everyone who downloaded the app and who contributed the island provided invaluable feedback to the nhs which will inform the future approach and direction of research he said that parts of the app had worked well adding it was good at measuring distance and islanders like the idea of a companion app helping to report symptoms it worked well on android phones however the app was very poor at picking up iphone interactions i understand that the google / apple app also has flaws especially at measuring distance but we i suspect have little choice but to work with apple since the app will have to work on their phones a test and trace system has been set up in the uk and the app was designed to be a key pillar in the fight against a second wave of covid-19 but officials said the government 's app was highly inaccurate when used on iphones only identifying around 4 per cent of contacts another criticism of the current system is that it is difficult for the person with coronavirus to provide details to tracers about strangers they do not know they may have come into contact with for example scenarios where if a person with coronavirus travels on public transport or goes into a shop the app is useful to track down unknown contacts germany italy denmark and others have already switched to a decentralised approach what does this mean google and apples apps have been heralded as being more privacy friendly than a centralised approached the apple google model would ping signals between handsets themselves which would make it difficult for authorities or hackers to try to use the data for themselves in a centralised approach which was what the government has been aiming for the contact matches would send information to a remote server how does a contact tracing app work a contact tracing app is designed to let someone know if they ve been in close contact with someone with coronavirus the app uses bluetooth to keep an anonymous log of everyone you come into close contact with when they or indeed yourself present symptoms of covid-19 tell the app and it will then alert anyone that has been in close proximity once installed and set up the app will run in the background keeping a log of everyone you pass users will need to provide the first part of their postcode and give the app permission to use bluetooth as well as its ability to receive notifications bluetooth will need to be kept on when a person is feeling unwell they need to send a report stating whether they are experiencing a high temperature and a continuous cough and when these symptoms started if it appears they might have the virus the person will be told to book a test the information is then uploaded along with the last 28 days of proximity events and fed into a complex at risk algorithm which

correspondent libby wiener dominic raab has suggested that taking the knee for black lives matter the stance many take when protesting against racism originated in tv series game of thrones while the stance was made popular by nfl quarterback colin kaepernick who took a knee during the american national anthem at a match in 2016 to protest against police brutality the foreign secretary appeared oblivious on this taking the knee thing i do n't know maybe it 's got a broader history it seems to be taken from the game of thrones mr raab told talkradio after being asked about premier league footballers taking the knee last night he added it feels to me like a symbol of subjugation and subordination rather than one of liberation and emancipation but i understand people feel differently about it so it 's a matter of personal choice test and trace figures due amid concern over impossible goals ' uninformed trump unaware uk was nuclear power book claims he said he would only perform the action for two people the queen and the missus when i asked her to marry me mr raabs comments drew fierce criticism from labour with shadow justice secretary david lammy describing the remarks as deeply embarrassing the foreign secretary later took to twitter to say he has full respect for the black lives matter movement he added if people wish to take a knee that s their choice and i respect it we all need to come together to tackle any discrimination and social injustice mr lammy tweeted this is not just insulting to the # blacklivesmatter movement it is deeply embarrassing for dominic raab he is supposed to be the foreign secretary of the united kingdom labour leader keir starmer said he thought mr raab would live to regret the comments adding he suspected the foreign secretary was wishing he had n't said it troy townsend of the anti - racism football organisation kick it out said mr raab should not have shown his own personal ignorance i think it was clumsy and if you are going to be putting yourself front and centre you should actually know what you 're talking about do n't make it a comedy act mr townsend told itv news do n't show your own personal ignorance about something that you must know is of importance to so many people by demeaning because people like me people of my colour people of an ethnic background have been demeaned for far too long now to get politicians demeaning us in 2020 as well labour former shadow home secretary diane abbott wrote taking the knee began in 2016 with american athletes refusing to stand for us national anthem they were protesting police brutality and racism but @dominicraab thinks it comes from game of thrones when kaepernick first took a knee he was ostracised by the nfl and has not played a game since 2016 football fans voiced their outrage at the player by burning his jersey while us president donald trump even said players should be fired for disrespecting the flag but now with the black lives matter movement back at the fore following the killing of george floyd an unarmed black man in the us the action of taking the knee is again being performed around the world protesters in london have been seen taking the knee while demonstrating and maintaining safe distances with marshalling police also taking part in a show of solidarity we were wrong nfl backtracks to allow protests amid black lives matter demonstrations removal of cecil rhodes statue backed by oxford college pub chain and insurance giant apologise for slavery links footballers also took a knee at the restart of premier league football on wednesday night with all four teams and the referees across the two matches doing so mr floyd 's killing has sparked furious debate in the uk about whether statues which commemorate slave owners should be taken down the statue of slave owner edward colston in bristol was pulled down by protesters on june 7 and thrown into the harbour activist and model munroe bergdorf said mr raab 's comments were tone deaf and insensitive adding the foreign secretary had shown his party was wildly out of touch mr raab told itv news he does n't believe the uk should be airbrushing its history after the governing body of an oxford university college expressed their wish to remove a statue of cecil rhodes rhodes was a british imperialist who founded rhodesia which is now zimbabwe and zambia mr raab said i think it 's right there should be points of debate i 'd like to see us upgrade refresh the symbols that we have for modern britain troy townsend of anti - racism campaign kick it out said the comments were clumsy if you are going to be putting yourself front and centre you should actually know what you 're talking about do n't make it into a comedy act do n't show your own personal ignorance about something that you must know is of importance to so many people by demeaning people like me people of my colour people of an ethnic background have been demeaned for far too long to now in 2020 get politicians demeaning us as well johnson says blm protests likely to end in deliberate and calculated violence mr floyd died after a white police officer held him down by pressing a knee into his neck for almost nine minutes in minneapolis on may 25 protests were sparked around the world after video footage showed mr floyd gasping that he could not breathe while being arrested by four officers the latest ministerial blunder comes after health secretary matt hancock mistakenly referred to manchester united footballer marcus rashford as daniel rashford labour mp jess phillips has told itv 's peston show the government should have made schools safe for more children to be back in now during the coronavirus pandemic ms phillips told political editor robert peston i want the children to be back at school when it is safe but i want that safety to have been planned for from the moment the schools were closed when asked about what measures should be in place for those graduating or leaving school the birmingham yardley mp said there absolutely should be schemes whether there are training schemes it 's not like we 've had a few weeks to plan for this we need to be looking at business schemes we need schemes that specifically target school leavers and those looking for work she added secretary of state for justice robert buckley said it is down to local authorities and local organisations to get the safety of schools right he added the idea that somehow we said in may that everything was going to happen by june that this is set in stone is i 'm afraid a misinterpretation of our plan and quite frankly unfair when we have been working at pace to support schools buckley continued schools are under control they are dictated to by headteachers local authorities the government can not dictate the pace of a school at the flick of a switch when asked about not seeing anyone on the frontbench from an ethnic minority background in a labour government ms phillips said what i know about equalities in political representation so it only really matters if it changes things on the grounds for ordinary people so absolutely i will pay credit to boris johnson in that regard but actually talking the talk or walking the walk or whichever one it is has got to be about action we need to see action from the millions of recommendations on the variety of reviews that have already been done not withstanding the lammy review the various windrush ones the government has put on a review instead of taking action the prime minister has to show he cares and do something about it theresa may 's former chief of staff gavin barwell said the pm has a good formation on tackling race and equality in the uk from his predecessor he said i think theresa got the race disparity audit and also the consultation showed that businesses wanted to publish the ethnic pay gap this is a really important issue for our country and boris johnson has got a real opportunity to drive this forward former england international john barnes told peston that people have to look at themselves to change their perception about black people he said we ca n't just think it is football fans or the police we have to look at ourselves and think can we change our perception of what black is towards the average black man not an elite black person not marcus rashford and obama and beyonce but how do we view the average black person and that 's what we have to change when asked about what he feels about the fact the uk is having another review rather than actually getting down to policies and change mr barnes said it 's not the first time it 's happened when you talk about policy and change how can laws and policies change people 's perceptions when people talk about education what education are we learning are we learning about the british empire that civilised the world or are we telling the truth about what really happened in colonial times barnes added because we 've believe the myth that the people who created racial hierarchy are stupid ignorant people they were n't they were the most intelligent scientists anthropologists who had to sell this myth of racial hierarchy morally and intellectually for us to be able to colonise the world until we deconstruct what we 've learnt nothing will be changed we can change policy we can change law we can meet targets but until the individual person changes his perception nothing will change because there will always be ways around those laws when asked about football behind closed doors barnes said it 's not ideal but either we do it or we wait for the stadiums to be full but we 'll be waiting for a long time he added football is n't just about the players football employs thousands of

livelihoods and not just the players means like everyone else we have to get back to some sort of normality not just in football but in society an raf vip plane used by the prime minister and the royal family is to have a national branding makeover at a cost of nearly 1million the grey voyager jet is to get a 900,000 red white and blue paint job as part of a pre - planned overhaul the union flag style rebrand will allow the raf voyager to continue to participate in military work according to number 10 on wednesday the prime ministers official spokesman said the raf voyager used by the

similar to many other leaders planes while also retaining its military air to air refuelling capability boris johnson involved in car crash while leaving parliament after pmqs the spokesman defended the 900,000 cost telling reporters that incorporates the cost of creating a design that will promote the uk around the world without compromising the planes vital military role at every stage we have worked to ensure value for money for the uk taxpayer and all of the work has been undertaken in the uk directly benefiting british suppliers mr johnson has previously questioned why the plane is grey as foreign secretary he said would like to have a brexit plane to help him travel the world and promote the governments vision of global britain he complained in 2018 that the raf voyager jet which is shared by the prime minister senior cabinet members and the royal family never seems to be available sir keir starmer has criticised boris johnson for making three u turns in a month pointing to recent policy changes on health charges mps voting and summer food vouchers the labour leader was full of vigour in his attacks on the government at pmqs and even suggested he and the prime minister swap places sir keir chose child poverty and support for local authorities during the coronavirus lockdown as his main topics however boris johnson often hit back with questions of his own he welcomed the government 's u - turn on summer meals for disadvantaged children in england a policy change forced by manchester united 's marcus rashford but said it was just one step to reducing child poverty the former lawyer cited a government commissioned report which said there are 600,000 more children living in relative poverty than in 2012 the prime minister said he was proud to be providing the covid summer food package to some of the poorest families in this country but said his opposite number was wrong about child poverty but i must say that he is completely wrong in what he says about poverty absolute poverty relative poverty have both declined under this government there are hundreds of thousands i think 400,000 fewer families living in poverty now than there were in 2010 as sir keir repeatedly asked questions on child poverty the prime minister repeatedly fired back asking sir keir to tell the public schools are safe this is turning into opposition questions sir keir remarked adding if the prime minister wants to swap places i m very happy we could do it now with a slip of the tongue speaker sir lindsay hoyle subsequently referred to the labour leader as prime minister mr johnson insisted he wants to tackle deprivation and said one of the best ways to help the poorest children in the country would be to encourage all kids who can go back to school to go back to school now because their schools are safe he demanded sir keir say schools are safe but said the unions wo nt let him say the truth a great ox has stood upon his tongue he added sir keir starmer said the pm is an expert in u turns with three in the space of a month during pmqs sir keir said the government has had three u turns in the last month first we had immigration health charges then we had mps voting and then we had free school meals hancock denies free meals u - turn and praises ' daniel rashford ' unacceptable failure after two from uk test positive for virus beijing

authorities in their covid-19 response mr johnson replied we have put 3.2 billion extra into local government to tackle coronavirus starmer warned council leaders face a choice between cutting core services or facing bankruptcy that will drive up poverty something the prime minister says he does nt intend to do local councils have done everything asked of them in this crisis the government has nt will the prime minister take responsibility and actually do something watch pmqs in full mr johnson said he had outlined support for local government adding the country can be very proud of its investments and the response of local government officials he added there are some councils particularly labour councils alas that are not opening their schools when they could be opening them and i say to him i hope for the last time now is the moment when he can say to those labour councillors that it is safe for kids to go back to reception to year one to year six to early years will he now say it sir keir replied every week the prime minister seems to complain that i ask him questions at prime ministers questions if he wants to swap place so be it boris johnson has said a free trade deal between the uk and australia will bring the two countries closer together than ever before in a video posted on twitter the prime minister hailed the common values held by the respective nations and boasted of the benefits of a trade agreement he said we export all kinds of things including i was amazed to discover boomerangs made in the uk exported to australia i do nt think they come back

that we can do whether its on financial services of across all the sectors of our free trade agreement lets get this free trade agreement done australia and the uk coming closer together than ever

us and japan are ongoing the first round of trade talks between the uk australia and new zealand is expected to begin via video conference in the coming weeks ms truss said our new found status as an independent trading nation will enable us to strengthen ties with countries around the world ambitious wide ranging free trade agreements with old friends like australia and new zealand are a powerful way for us to do that and make good on the promise of brexit pivoting towards the asia pacific will diversify our trade increase the resilience of our supply chains and ensure the uk is less

trade to boost business would be welcomed by british industry the emphasis on helping the uks smaller businesses access the opportunities of international trade particularly in liberalising access for

is embarking on an ambitious new era of independent trade and these new deals are critical to the success of small businesses as well as the wider economy of the small businesses that export 38 %

small business chapter is equally important to ensure that the needs of smes are fully catered for in the years to come matt hancock has denied the government was forced into making an embarrassing u - turn on free school meals in england by footballer marcus rashford but thanked him for his contribution the england footballer successfully brought about a change in policy after his campaign to extend the food voucher scheme into the summer holidays despite a spokesperson for the department for education initially stating the national voucher scheme will not run during the summer holidays the move prompted labour leader sir keir starmer to call boris johnson an expert in u turns during wednesday 's prime minister 's questions with three in the space of a month heath secretary mr hancock told itv news rashford 's intervention was extremely powerful and very moving but suggested it facilitated a change that may have already been coming initially it was a yes to an extra 60 million going through local authorities and then we kept looking at it and then the prime minister made his judgement he told political reporter shehab khan the funny thing is that if the government never changes its view then you 'd say that it did n't listen any new policy development involves changing things and changing things is n't necessarily a bad thing mr hancock even jokingly said premier league footballers should join the cabinet get elected join public life it 's hard but the service is worth it in an earlier interview he mistakenly praised daniel rashford rather than marcus rashford for his campaign the health secretary later blamed the early morning start for using the wrong name and said he may have had harry potter on the mind when he referred to marcus rashford as daniel rashford my seven year old listens to harry potter and reads harry potter avidly including at 5.30 this morning when i got up to do this mornings media round he told lbc responding on twitter rashford wrote i ve been called much worse over the last couple of days government u turns on children 's free summer meals after previously rejecting plea from marcus rashford marcus rashford i m grateful boris johnson changed policy on free school meals the 22-year old has now said he is considering the next steps for the campaign he told bbc breakfast i think this is only going to be successful throughout the summer period so we ve bought ourselves six weeks of time now to plan and figure out what s next and keep taking steps forward i do nt want this to be the end of it because there are definitely more steps that need to be taken so we just need to analyse the response the manchester united striker added that people are struggling all year round and said he now wants to learn how we can help them best in the future rashford initially wrote an open letter on monday asking the government to reverse its decision not to award free school meals vouchers to vulnerable children outside term time at first a department for education spokesperson said that the national voucher scheme was not being extended followed by a series of bizarre responses from ministers to the call in his initial call for the u - turn rashford spoke about his personal experience relying on similar schemes but amid mounting pressure number 10 said on tuesday that the government would provide a covid summer food fund to reflect the fact that families face an unprecedented situation over the holidays downing street announced a one off 120 million fund which will benefit some 1.3 million children in england over the six week summer period at prime minister 's questions on wednesday labour leader sir keir starmer said he welcomed the governments u - turn but said it was just one step to reducing child poverty sir keir added the pm is an expert in u turns with three in the space of a month bizarre responses from ministers after marcus rashford 's call for free summer meal vouchers rejected pressure mounts on government to extend food voucher scheme over summer following calls from marcus rashford boris johnson congratulated rashford on the campaign at tuesday 's daily coronavirus briefing saying the policy change was the right thing to do the pm told the downing street press conference clearly free school meals should generally apply in term time that s what they are there for but we have to understand the pressures families are under right now and that s why we ve responded as we have as i say i think it is the right thing to do and it will help the kids from the families who really need it it is understood that payment will be in the form of a one off six week voucher given to eligible families at the end of term to use in supermarkets the vouchers will amount to 15 a week per child and some 1.3 million children in england will be eligible the prime ministers spokesman said the part of government responsible for tracking immigration has not had an up to date estimate of the size of the illegal population in the uk in 15 years according to a report the last estimate made in 2005 suggested there were about 430,000 people in the country with no right to remain here but independent research since then has put the figure at more than one million the national audit office nao said its report into the home offices immigration enforcement directorate said the department has instead estimated demand for immigration enforcement activity which it put at between 240,000 and 320,000 cases per year but there is no baseline given against which progress can be assessed or to show whether demand for enforcement activity is going up or down the report added meg hillier head of parliaments financial watchdog said it appeared the home office had no idea how many people are in the uk illegally and does nt seem interested in finding out violence fears after home secretary orders fingerprinting of migrants ' low skilled migrant workers to be denied visas after brexit during last years general election campaign home secretary priti patel vowed to reduce immigration overall the naos report also concluded that despite collecting information around its missions and objectives the department often can not show whether its measures are working while detected attempts by people to come into the uk by clandestine means has risen to 46,900 in the year to october 2019 from 40,800 in the same period for the previous year it is unclear whether that was down to more attempts being made overall or better detection the report said the department is also unable to assess whether its measures to prevent people accessing government funded services have any meaningful impact on the likelihood that an individual will leave the uk voluntarily the report added the number of people leaving the uk either enforced by the home office or voluntarily has fallen dramatically since 2015 to over 13,100 people in the 12 months to the end of november last year the report said while the department encourages voluntary returns those have fallen to an average of approximately 460 a month last year from an average of 1,200 a month in 2015 the nao said almost 5,000 of the 7,400 immigration offenders subject to enforced last year were foreign national offenders the report said adding that that figure has remained stable and accounts for around two thirds of total enforced returns what you need to know on new government immigration plans the nao said the home office could look at how other parts of government come up with estimates of hidden activity such as serious and organised crime which it said could help to improve its understanding of the full scale of the illegal population in the uk and identify new ways to address some of the challenges it faces the highest estimate of the illegal population in the uk is 1.2 m given by the pew research centre last year but the nao acknowledged it had not attempted to verify the number the report said although there would be significant uncertainty around any estimate it the department developed such an estimate could help the department to demonstrate that its activities are effective in deterring attempts to enter or remain in the uk illegally ms hillier chairwoman of the public accounts committee said the home office has no idea how many people are in the country illegally and does nt seem interested in finding out it ca nt demonstrate that its actions to control illegal immigration are working as intended and does nt understand how different aspects of its work fit together gareth davies head of the nao said the work of immigration enforcement by its very nature is complex and challenging while the home office has introduced significant changes to its enforcement activity it can not demonstrate that overall performance is improving the department needs a better understanding of the impact of its immigration enforcement activity on its overarching vision to reduce the size of the illegal population and the harm it causes a home office spokesman said we have taken back control of our immigration system and for the first time in a generation we will have full control over who comes and stays here as this report acknowledges the nature of immigration crime and offending is complicated and we are consistently looking at ways to get ahead of the organised gangs behind it we work tirelessly with international partners and agencies such as the nca to tackle illegal migration close down routes for people smuggling and return those with no right to remain the uk wherever possible we make no apology for seeking to deport foreign national offenders and since 2010 we have removed more than 53,000 criminals a military plane used by the prime minister and members of the royal family is being repainted in the colours of the union flag the grey raf voyager jet is expected to get a red white and blue makeover at an airport in cambridge as part of a pre - planned overhaul boris johnson has previously questioned why the plane is grey as foreign secretary he said would like to have a brexit plane to help him travel the world and promote the governments vision of global britain he complained in 2018 that the raf voyager jet which is shared by the prime minister senior cabinet members and the royal family never seems to be

chances of dying from covid-19 have been greatly reduced by this treatment he said he was proud of the fantastic team of scientists right here in the uk who conducted the first robust clinical trial anywhere in the world on the use of dexamethasone as a coronavirus treatment he thanked the thousands of patients in the uk who volunteered for the trials sir patrick valance the government 's chief scientific adviser said the drug is cheap meaning it can have effect worldwide dexamethasone is inexpensive very widely available and the really exciting thing about this study is not only that it works but it means that it can work across the world he told the press conference why wo nt johnson and cummings learn from last crisis but according to a government list of drugs from from export dexamethasone had been banned in tablet form on april 24 and as an oral solution or for injection on june 16 prime minister johnson said he was not aware of the ban adding it sounds peculiar to me englands chief medical officer professor chris whitty earlier said the dexamethasone trial will save lives around the world patients given dexamethasone and who were not on a ventilator saw death rates drop by a fifth in comparison to standard care the risk of death was cut from 40 per cent to 28 per cent for patients on ventilators for those in need of oxygen the risk of death was reduced

others who received standard care peter horby leader of the recovery trial called their findings a major breakthrough while the government 's chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance said the results were tremendous professor horby said the results of the trial were really quite remarkable the university of oxford academic who has led the dexamethasone trial said his teams efforts in the trial had broken records speaking at the daily downing street briefing he said in three months we have enrolled over 11,500 patients and this makes it by far the biggest clinical trial in the world he said the majority of patients being treated in hospital for coronavirus were likely to benefit from the study into dexamethosone after conducting a trial comparing 2,000 people being treated with the drug and 4,000 without during the trial which concluded on june 8 patients received a low dose of 6 mg per day by mouth or injection for 10 days the prime minister said the drug would now be available across the nhs and we have taken steps to ensure we have enough supplies even in the event of a second peak mr johnson is speaking after allowing a major policy u - turn on free meals for children during the summer holidays following pressure piled on by marcus rashford 's campaign mr johnson said he had spoken to england striker rashford to congratulate him on his campaign for free school meals over the summer adding i thank him for what he s done his appeal for an extension to the free school meal voucher scheme through the summer holidays had been dismissed despite increasing

international development is to be scrapped in a merger with the foreign office watch boris johnson 's press conference in full boris johnson has defended his decision to scrap the department for international development in a merger with the foreign office after former conservative prime minister david cameron labelled it a mistake in an earlier tweet the former incumbent of number 10 said mr johnson 's move to merge the two department would result in less respect for the uk but as he came under fire from former prime ministers and international development secretaries as well as opposition mps mr johnson insisted the merger would create a better more powerful more positive voice for this country overseas labour leader sir keir starmer called the announcement of the foreign commonwealth and development office a distraction from the uk 's economic woes and high covid-19 death toll in a statement on tuesday to mps mr johnson said it was outdated to keep the departments separate why wo nt johnson and cummings learn from last crisis government u turns on children 's free summer meals after rejecting rashford plea mr johnson told the commons on tuesday we must now strengthen our position in an intensely competitive world by making sensible changes and so i have decided to merge dfid with the foreign and commonwealth office to create a new department the foreign commonwealth and development office itv news political correspondent romilly weeks explains how past uk leaders have reacted to the merger mr cameron said that while the prime minister was right to maintain the commitment to 0.7 merging the two departments will mean less expertise less voice for development at the top table and ultimately less respect for the uk overseas sir keir tweeted boris johnson abolishing an entire government department is a poor attempt at distraction the economy contracted by 20 % in april we have one of the highest death tolls from covid-19 in the world and in the last hour the government have u turned on free school meals former prime minister tony blair whose government created dfid said the move was wrong and regressive in a statement he said i am utterly dismayed by the decision to abolish dfid we created dfid in 1997 to play a strong important role in projecting british soft power it has done so to general global acclaim it is a leader in both programmes and thought in development helping millions of the worlds most vulnerable to be relieved of poverty and killer diseases the strategic aims of alignment with diplomacy and focus on new areas of strategic interest to britain could be accomplished without its abolition wrong and regressive move his successor gordon brown accused mr johnson of abolishing one of the uks great international assets current labour mps also hit out at the move shadow foreign secretary lisa nandy labelled it a retreat she tweeted extraordinary that in the middle of a global crisis the uk is retreating from the world aid has long been one of britains strengths helping us to build strong alliances act as a moral force and creating greater global security once again we are diminished in the world work will begin immediately on the merger and the department will be formally established in early september with foreign secretary dominic raab in charge of the new look operation international development secretary anne marie trevelyan will remain in post until the merger is complete downing street sources indicated that there would be no compulsory redundancies the target of spending 0.7 % of gni on development which was part of the december manifesto and is enshrined in law will remain it has been confirmed rory stewart both a former international development secretary and foreign office minister said he would have been strongly arguing against the shake up if he was still in office he added i do nt think it is the smart option there are many other things we need to be concentrating on at the moment it will lead to a lot of disruption a lot of uncertainty at a time when the foreign office has an enormous amount to be focused on it was rumoured during the february reshuffle that boris johnson was preparing to scrap the post of international development secretary before appointing ms trevelyan to the role tory mp andrew mitchell who served as international development secretary during the coalition government joined in criticising the proposals saying abolishing dfid would be a quite extraordinary mistake in a statement to pa the former cabinet minister said it would destroy one of the most effective and respected engines of international development anywhere in the world video report by itv news political correspondent dan hewitt the government has bowed to

set up to help disadvantaged families during the coronavirus lockdown as children would not be receiving meals at school however the plan had been to scrap the support at the start of the school summer holidays the plan to stop support was met with fury by politicians from across the spectrum teaching unions and the former head of ofsted who all said children do n't stop being hungry when the summer holidays start manchester united striker rashford waded into the debate writing a letter to all mps urging them to press the government for a u - turn the 22-year old england footballer penned an open letter this week asking the government to reverse its decision to curtail the scheme for which nearly 1.3 million children are eligible outside of school term time addressing the meal voucher issue and the broader subject of childhood poverty rashford wrote i do nt claim to have the education of an mp in parliament but i do have a social education i am clued up on the difference a u turn decision would make on the 1.3 million vulnerable children across the uk who are registered for free school meals because ten years ago i was one of them mr johnsons official spokesperson has said the prime minister will respond to mr rashfords letter as soon as he can adding how the intention remains to get all students back by september the spokesperson also said mr johnson had not seen a tone deaf comment made by a minister on tuesday morning due to being in meetings following a tweet in which rashford called for the public to consider parents who 've had their water turned off during lockdown work and pensions secretary therese coffey responded water can not be disconnected though social media users including several mps denounced the comment labour deputy leader angela rayner chipped in revealing how her family could n't afford hot water when i was growing up she added i do nt know if you ve ever experienced poverty and being unable to pay the bills but as secretary of state for work and pensions i would have expected better from you another bizarre comment was made by grant shapps who in an interview with itv news suggested providing cancer treatment was as important as providing a child a meal though he quickly said his comment had been misinterpreted political correspondent paul brand asked can you tell me something that 's more important than making sure a child has a meal to which the transport secretary responded well providing a cancer operation there are many many things which are incredibly important but i do n't think it 's an either / or i think parents should be able to of course feed their children which is why we have a furlough scheme to ensure people are still in work he added let 's just be clear you asked me what 's as important or more important i said there are other things that are incredibly important like cancer operations but i then quickly went on to say there is no play off between one or the other both of these things are important but it is the case that we are putting money into exactly these things which is absolutely right this is the worst economic crisis for perhaps three centuries but it was not that long ago we were in the throes of an economic disaster we thought was the worst any of us would experience the banking crisis the response of the government led by gordon brown was not perfect but there is no credible narrative that describes it as a disaster in some contrast to the narratives of even tory mps for this governments stewardship of the covid-19 challenge arguably there could and should have been a more imaginative reform of the banking system in the aftermath of the 2007/8 shock but the magnitude of the loss of national income was significantly dampened also unemployment increased far less than most economists expected that said there was a painful trade off in that living standards subsequently stagnated for many more years than was anticipated by those same economists but the important point is that the wheels did not come off we survived and gradually began to thrive again and many would argue the too gradually was the painful legacy of camerons and osbornes ensuing austerity by the way the stats released on tuesday showing unemployment has not risen yet are neither comforting or surprising the point is that as of 14 june a staggering 11.7 m people would in normal circumstances have been classified as unemployed at least many of them would have been if it were not for the near 30bn spent so far by the treasury on subsidising companies to keep staff on their books and the self employed to continue being self employed in a technical if not economically real sense the 9 % drop in hours actually worked also revealed on tuesday is a better clue to the unemployment horrors that await absent an ambitious and creative treasury plan to redirect redundant workers to new opportunities and relevant training so here is what is profoundly puzzling there is expertise available about how to cope with the mother of all economic shocks the last one but this government led by boris johnson seems to be totally ignoring it just as the prime minister seemingly ignored health lessons learned by other countries that were ahead of us in the coronavirus crisis while tory refusenik rory stewart was almost branded an enemy of the people by his erstwhile cabinet colleagues for begging that the government learn from south korea singapore and china this is not to argue that boris johnson should invite gordon brown himself into government at this moment of economic life or death their characters are so different one obsessive about what actually works the other obsessive about how it looks you decide which is which that it is hard to imagine what a constructive conversation between the two of them would be but there is an enormous store of knowledge in former officials and advisers who were in the thick of the banking crisis or were simply top class civil servants and now operate at very senior levels in the private sector those who spring to mind include sharon white chair of john lewis shriti vadera recently chosen to chair the prudential and john kingman chair of legal and general there are plenty of others too apart from having been battle hardened in a previous economic crisis they have another big thing in common which seems sorely lacking in this administration they actually know how to get things done in government they know how to operate the whitehall and public sector machines the help of none has been sought and it is hard to resist the suspicion that they have been ignored because we are still in an era where they will be viewed through the prism of brexit as remainers who are part of the problem and are therefore not to be trusted that is not a suspicion lacking in evidence the prime ministers most powerful adviser dominic cummings has peopled downing street and the treasury with vote leave allies and sympathisers the cabinet us still largely a brexiter cabinet even though brexit was yesterdays battle and another thing the two most eye catching and important recent appointments the individuals to run vaccines and nhs test and trace were kate bingham and dido harding who have one thing in common along with impressive commercial records their spouses are tory mps jesse norman and john penrose respectively and are therefore part of the family as it were here is the thing bingham and harding may well have been the most outstanding candidates but we are in the grips of a crisis of such magnitude and complexity that if johnson and cummings lack the confidence to go outside the family for advice and support we are probably in big trouble because keeping it in the family has not been an unmitigated triumph yet more from robert peston why is test and trace contacting only one in nine people infected with covid-19 peston why the coronavirus recovery is worsening hideous

money into exactly these things which is absolutely right following a tweet in which rashford called for the public to consider parents who 've had their water turned off during lockdown the work and pensions secretary responded water can not be disconnected though therese coffey 's comment was quickly denounced on twitter with many branding it tone deaf what you need to know about the premier league return around 90 minutes later she tweeted rashford saying she welcomes his passion for supporting children and said the government will continue to support the economy through lockdown labour deputy leader angela rayner chipped in revealing how her family could n't afford hot water when i was growing up she added i do nt know if you ve ever experienced poverty and being unable to pay the bills but as secretary of state for work and pensions i would have expected better from you the england star followed up on his letter to mps with a column in the times newspaper on tuesday writing he was focusing on a trophy that stands for something bigger than football addressing the meal voucher issue and the broader subject of childhood poverty rashford wrote i do nt claim to have the education of an mp in parliament but i do have a social education i am clued up on the difference a u turn decision would make on the 1.3 million vulnerable children across the uk who are registered for free school meals because ten years ago i was one of them boris johnsons official spokesperson has said the prime minister will respond to mr rashfords letter as soon as he can shoppers out in force as stores across england reopen meanwhile the uk 's largest food charity told itv news more vulnerable children could go hungry this summer as it warns charities will need 40 % more food to meet demand some 1.3 million children are eligible for free school meals during term time but most rely on charities for food in the summer holidays fareshare which last year provided meals to over 43,000 vulnerable children says coronavirus has made the situation worse with many families being pushed into financial hardship and a further 1.4 million families applying for universal credit rashford who supports the charity has helped raise 20 million toward the effort to feed more children it comes as a legal challenge on the government 's decision not to continue food vouchers over the summer was launched by two charities sustain and the good law project have also written to england 's department of education calling the government 's plans inadequate and warning hundreds of thousands of children will go hungry they argue the government 's other programme the holiday activities and food scheme will only reach around 50,000 children in 17 of the 343 local authorities in england less than four percent of those eligible for free school meals the campaign received a further push on monday night when lineker told bbc newsnight he urged the government to consider the struggles of impoverished families during the coronavirus crisis it seems strange that we have to be in a position where we are desperately arguing to try to get young people fed and stop them being hungry he said number of uk workers on payroll falls by more than 600,000 uk travellers take coronavirus back to new zealand pressure mounts on government to extend food voucher scheme meanwhile the labour party say they will today use an opposition day debate in parliament to call on the government to continue to directly fund the provision of free school meals over the holidays labour launched a holidays without hunger campaign on sunday shadow education secretary rebecca long bailey will say any government that is willing to let the poorest children in the country go hungry needs to take a long hard look at its priorities shamefully children go hungry every year but this summer will be especially difficult for many families as job losses and reduced incomes hit household budgets it would be deeply callous of the government not to take this small step to ease the financial pressure on households and ensure children can eat during the summer holidays home secretary priti patel has condemned the actions of those who protested in london at the weekend speaking in the house of commons on monday ms patel was highly critical of the far right demonstrators in the capital on saturday who clashed with police like all members of this house i was saddened and sickened at the far right thugs who came to london this weekend on a so called mission to protect the statue of sir winston churchill claiming to want to protect our countrys heritage and yet failing to understand that our countrys heritage is founded on a set of shared values tolerance respect for people and property adherence to the rule of law she said and those thugs far from protecting our heritage did all that they could to destroy and undermine those values there is no place for their sickening conduct and hate in our society ms patel said a total of 137 arrests were made on saturday alone as counter - demonstrations took place and at least 100 officers were injured three horses and one police dog she said at least 280 arrests have now been made one of those arrested on saturday was andrew banks who was sentenced to two weeks in prison after pleading guilty to outraging public decency having been pictured urinating next to a memorial to pc keith palmer during the far right protests as this ugly operational picture demonstrates many of the so called protesters came with the deliberate intent of causing harm to those around them and to police officers this hooliganism is utterly indefensible there can be no excuse for pelting police officers with missiles she said of all the dreadful images to emerge from this weekend the one of a man desecrating the plaque of pc keith palmer was the most abhorrent pc palmer she said made the ultimate sacrifice during a terror attack at the heart of our democracy adding he will never be forgotten she said sadly backing our world class police has never been more important the scenes of violence and disorder that we have seen in recent weeks have only underlined the challenges that they face it was instinct black lives matter supporter did n't even think twice about saving suspected far right protester racist thuggery has no place on our streets ' says pm after day of violent clashes far right protesters and police clash as 5 pm curfew set for demonstrations ms patel said that the counter - demonstrators in westminster on saturday were patently racist and were abusive towards police officers they were violent they were aggressive and abusive towards police officers they were patently racist it is right that a good number have been arrested she added ms patel said in total over 210,000 people have attended demonstrations across the country following the death of george floyd at least 160 protests took place this weekend with the vast majority passing peacefully but counter - demonstrations sparked ugly scenes on saturday 2,000 people attended counter - protests in westminster with eruptions of violence throughout the day racist and far right hooligans clashed with the police and fights broke out smoke bombs glass bottles were lobbed at the police in shameful scenes thirty eight officers were hurt across the country this weekend as they were kicked punched or pelted with missiles ms patel said the far right in the uk represents a serious serious and growing threat labour mp lloyd russell moyle said we must nt just dismiss these people however just as thugs because we know that they are organised they have killed before including personal friends not only here in britain but in norway as well responding ms patel said this is a serious serious and growing threat we have lone actors operating around the world on virtual networks and there is a great deal of work that s taking place that we can be proud of she added we have to be vigilant to protect our people our country but also to prevent some terrible atrocity from taking place video report by itv news political correspondent romilly weeks boris johnsons pledge to establish a cross - government commission on racial inequality is a back of a fag packet plan designed to assuage the black lives matter protest labour has claimed shadow justice secretary david lammy said there have been several reviews into racism in the uk in recent years and the announcement of another makes it feel like we want figures data but we do nt want action mr johnson writing in the daily telegraph said the commission on race and ethnic disparities would look at all aspects of inequality in employment in health outcomes in academic and all other walks of life blm supporter did n't think twice about saving suspected far right protester matt lucas and david walliams issue apology over little britain blackface and he told broadcasters what i really want to do as prime minister is change the narrative so we stop the sense of victimisation and discrimination we stamp out racism and we start to have a real sense of expectation of success that s where i want to get to but it wo nt be easy the announcement follows two weeks of protests across the country by the black lives matter movement following the killing in the us of george floyd who died as a white police officer knelt on his neck mr lammy criticised the government for not providing details on the scope of the commission i do nt know why he s announced a commission behind a paywall in the telegraph buried in the middle of yet another article about churchill the labour mp told bbc radio 4s today programme if he was serious why are there no details about how it will be staffed its remit its terms of reference its timetable that s the question its because this was written on the back of a fag packet yesterday to assuage the black lives matter protest get on with the action legislate move you re in government do something mr lammy said it is deeply worrying and frankly immature that britain is still having a conversation about whether racism actually exists and frankly when you watch a man die like we did in eight minutes and 46 seconds i d like to ask boris johnson why he thinks the way to commemorate his death is to announce yet another commission and why he insists on talking about statues mr lammy claimed the conservative party wants a culture war because they want to distract from the central issue discrimination on frontline of coronavirus outbreak may be factor in disproportionate bame deaths among nhs staff unpublished coronavirus bame protection advice to be released next week after backlash when asked about what recommendations the prime minister will take after the several reviews that have been conducted he said the whole point about having a review is to look at the areas where people feel that there is more that needs to be done for instance we 've already acted on the lammy report we did stuff to and we continue to do more for instance young black males who are involved in crime do n't automatically get moved to prosecution we try and sort things out you make sure that you have more ba black and minority groups in the prison service in the probation service and more use of body worn cameras so you know people have more confidence about the criminal justice system mr johnson added i think what we want to do is learn now very fast what fresh changes we need to make and what i feel most strongly is that there are so many positive stories that are sort of so far not being heard i think things really are changing and you 're seeing young black kids now doing better in some of the most difficult subjects in school than they were ever before you 're seeing more going to top universities we need to start telling that story and building up that culture of high expectations and narrative about success as well as stamping out the racism and the discrimination that unquestionably exists it 's two things that we need to do at once david isaac chairman of the equality and human rights commission said there had already been countless reports on the issues surrounding racial inequality and called for urgent action he said we know the scale of the problems we face to tackle the entrenched racial inequality in our country it is not new there have been countless reports and the data exists exposing all the issues now is the time for urgent action we need to see a clear and comprehensive race strategy with clear targets and timescales from government we hope this new commission will help deliver that and we stand ready to work with it mr johnson also faced criticism for saying that the government wants to stop the sense of victimisation and discrimination lord woolley of woodford who chairs the race disparity units advisory group said it is real discrimination and that some of the prime ministers language is frankly unhelpful the telegraph reported that the new commission will report directly to mr johnson and also be overseen by equalities minister kemi badenoch it said an independent chairman or woman will be appointed to oversee the body which will comprise people with a mix of ethnic social and professional backgrounds mr johnson also used his article to defend the statue of winston churchill in parliament square which some protesters want pulled down and to warn against attempts to photoshop britains cultural landscape he lauded churchill as one of the countrys greatest ever leaders saying it is the height of lunacy to accuse him of racism i will resist with every breath in my body any attempt to remove that statue from parliament square and the sooner his protective shielding comes off the better he wrote he went on it is not just that it is wrong to destroy public property by violence i am also extremely dubious about the growing campaign to edit or photoshop the entire cultural landscape if we start purging the record and removing the images of all but those whose attitudes conform to our own we are engaged in a great lie a distortion of our history like some public figure furtively trying to make themselves look better by editing their own wikipedia entry mr johnson also condemned the counter - protesters who clashed with police in london on saturday as far right thugs and bovver boys it was right that a good number should have been arrested he said they were violent they were aggressive towards the police they were patently racist there is nothing that can excuse their behaviour mp amy callaghan has pledged to come back stronger fitter and more determined than ever after suffering a brain haemorrhage the snp politician was elected to the house of commons in

the government to reconsider its decision not to extend the current food voucher scheme into the summer holidays the scheme was set up to effectively guarantee meals to those children who would have ordinarily been reliant on free school meals during the coronavirus lockdown but young england forward rashford who raised 20million to boost food distribution with the charity fareshare is concerned the plan to end the scheme next month will affect some of the most vulnerable in society in an open letter to the government rashford wrote the government has taken a whatever it takes approach to the economy i m asking you today to extend that same thinking to protecting all vulnerable children across england rashford spoke about his personal experience relying on food voucher schemes as a child he continued i encourage you to hear their pleas and find your humanity please reconsider your decision to cancel the food voucher scheme over the summer holiday period and guarantee the extension this is england in 2020 and this is an issue that needs urgent assistance please while the eyes of the nation are on you make the u - turn and make protecting the lives of some of our most vulnerable a top priority non - essential shops in england reopen for first time in three months coronavirus children on free school meals to get 15 weekly food voucher rashford has previously spoken about how his family relied on breakfast clubs and free school meals as a child and does not want other children to miss out on opportunities if they do not have access to similar schemes he added as a black man from a low income family in wythenshawe manchester i could have been just another statistic children 's hunger does n't go away during the holidays so what 's being done to feed over a million kids instead due to the selfless actions of my mum my family my neighbours and my coaches the only stats i m associated with are goals appearances and caps i would be doing myself my family and my

transport could be fined up to 100 if they do not wear a face covering from monday the transport secretary has warned from june 15 it will be compulsory for people to wear a face covering when on public transport and operators will be able to refuse permission to travel if someone is not wearing one grant shapps said there will be gentle approach to enforcement during first couple of days but said there will be fines for non - compliance too he told the downing street briefing remembering your face covering should be the same as picking up your phone your wallet or your purse whenever you re leaving your house he said people should wear face coverings to protect your fellow commuters when travelling on the buses coaches trams ferries aircraft and trains the transport secretary said people should only wear coverings something such as a scarf or a home made garment and not clinical face masks which should only be health professionals hundreds of thousands of face coverings will be handed out for passenger use at many locations across the rail network in england from monday the one off initiative which will run for several days at a number of stations will see coverings provided free of charge to support passengers and help them travel safely first family reunions in care homes with socially distanced solution two metre rule under review says johnson as he looks to next easing the police and transport for london authorised personnel will be able to issue fixed penalty notices of 100 or 50 if paid in 14 days earlier on friday a german report published by the institute of labour economics said compulsory face coverings could reduce the daily growth rate of reported infections by around 40 % mr shapps said there was no need for people to wear them in all public settings just in enclosed spaces by its very nature if you are on a train or a plane or a ferry or a bus you are in an enclosed area that is not the case if you are out and about on the streets and i think that may be the principle difference of this sir peter hendy the chairman of network rail said as the economy ramps up with the reopening of non - essential retail from monday there will be more and more occasions in which you might be closer to people than you would care for as such he said it seems perfectly logical to enforce face coverings from the same point professor stephen powis added that the evidence is weak on the effectiveness of face coverings in reducing the spread of coronavirus but said there is some evidence they work he said it is better for people to wear them in closed spaces than open spaces where there is less risk of transmission exemptions for the use of face coverings will apply to those with certain health conditions disabled people and children under the age of 11 cab hailing app uber has followed the government 's lead in enforcing face coverings with all drivers and passengers across the uk being told to wear them from monday the firms regional general manager for northern and eastern europe jamie heywood said as cities begin to reopen and people start moving again were taking measures to help everyone stay safe and healthy every time they use uber we ve introduced measures to ensure that every driver can access the ppe personal protective equipment they need for free to help keep them safe when driving with uber and from monday we will require anyone using the uber app in the uk to wear a face covering pm says uk will bounce back as economy plunges 20 % in april r number rises in england but stays steady in uk as whole johnson shameful churchill statue has to be protected mr shapps played down reports that the chief nursing officer for england has been unable or unwilling to take part in the no 10 press briefings because she would not defend dominic cummings the transport secretary told the friday briefing that he expected ruth may would be appearing again at future briefings i do nt think it is true she has attended them many times before i notice that at the top of the no 10 twitter feed i see one of her tweets pinned he said i am absolutely sure she has been a regular contributor before and i am sure she will be back here again the update follows news that the uk economy shrunk by more than a fifth for the first full month of the coronavirus lockdown the office for national statistics said economic activity dropped by 20.4 per cent in april the largest drop in a single month since records began in 1997 speaking following the release of the figures mr johnson said he was not surprised the uk had been badly hit by the lockdown mr shapps sought to allay concerns that the r value could be above one in the south west of england i think not to be overly alarmed because as professor steve powis said it was actually the top of a range which had a number of others that showed it was below 1 professor powis said r is of course a very important way of looking at this but there are other things that we look at but he said the ons surveillance study showed a steady reduction in the number of infections in the community and really that evidence also suggests the r value is below 1 because it is only when the r value is below 1 that we would see that decrease in infections he added the two metre social distancing rule is under review the prime minister has said as he looked ahead to the next easing of lockdown restrictions the government wants to reopen the hospitality industry as soon as july 4 however many firms have said the two metre rule would need to be reduced to one metre before they are able to reopen many firms say it would not be possible to enforce two metre social distancing rules inside their small venues meaning their business would be unviable if they open the world health organisation says one metre is a safe distance but the uk government insists it is important to move with caution and says it will only reduce lockdown further if the five tests are being met the prime minister said the two metres is right currently but we 're working with the scientists to work out a moment when the numbers of infection are down so far that we can really say that the two metre rule is no longer necessary support bubbles who can now meet up indoors from saturday coronavirus why social distancing works at the moment probably one in a thousand maybe one in 1,600 actually have coronavirus amongst us all the proportion will continue to get smaller and smaller he said if that happens the risk of any of us being next to someone whether two metres or one metre or one centimetre away from somebody else who has the virus that risk becomes much much lower sir patrick vallance the government 's chief scientific adviser told a media briefing that the two metre rule is a political decision taken on advice from sage and that there 's not likely to be any exact science on it anytime soon he said with ons figures on friday showing the number of people with new infections is still declining and thus less chance of catching it it may influence political decisions to lower the distance before relaxing lockdown further the government says there must be reliable data from sage showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board boris johnson on the r number the latest update from sage suggests the rate of infection r number has not decreased from last week 's estimate which was between 0.7 and 0.9.a spokesman for the prime minister told a remote westminster briefing as with all public health guidance the two metre rule is under constant review to ensure it reflects the latest advice from sage that will be based on also the latest evidence we have on transmission of the virus r number rises in england but stays steady in uk as whole hollywood actor nathalie emmanuel has told the calling peston podcast how she still suffers racist abuse despite now being a hollywood actor with millions of fans the game of thrones star said racism does n't stop it does n't change with fame and said she still suffers the same kind of abuse she became used to as a child nathalie who has recently attended black lives matter protests in london said her first experience of racism came at age six when she said she should could not understand why people had decided she was different i suffered countless examples of racism you know like the usual slurs in the park you know when you 're playing with your friends and someone 's you know decides that that 's what you are she said she says she became accustomed to being called things like the n word or dirty because your skin is brown all of these like offensive things that you have to live through she said nathalie on her experiences racism but even now nathalie finds herself being followed round shops to make sure i 'm not stealing she said recently somebody grabbed hold of their bag while they sat next to her because they thought i might steal it the former hollyoaks actor turned hollywood star said she uses her fame to amplify voices speaking out against racism often the response from people who disagree with me is to be racist is to be misogynistic is to be just genuinely hateful she said adding how people now feel they have permission to abuse her when nathalie first began acting she found herself having to turn down stereotypical roles because of the negative depiction of black or brown people she says the film industry is changing but said in a space dominated by white actors the mere presence of an ethnic minority is political nathalie said as a woman of colour with very light skin she believes she will not have suffered as severely and as harshly as my peers and those who are darker skinned than me but she said growing up in southend a predominantly white area she suffered countless examples of racism despite being subjected to racist abuse nathalie says she will always be engaged in this conversation it 's an ongoing conversation but one that i 'm here for and one that i 'm continuing to have she said you can listen and subscribe to calling peston wherever you get your podcasts including apple podcasts spotify and google podcasts or listen to the latest episode below the reproduction rate of coronavirus r number has risen above 1 in parts of england but has remained constant in the uk as a whole a briefing by the scientific advisory group for emergencies sage has revealed the group which advises the government on its covid-19 response said the r number in england was estimated to be between 0.8 and 1 a marginal increase sage also published regional values for r in england for the first time with the south west having the highest range at 0.8 - 1.1 but despite a relaxation of lockdown the estimation for the uk as a whole remains below one between 0.7 and 0.9 which means the spread of the virus is decreasing last week sir patrick vallance the government 's chief scientific adviser told journalists the value for england was between 0.7 and 1 admitting there was a bit of regional variation the east of england is at 0.7 0.9 london the midlands the north west and the south east at 0.8 1.0 and the north east and yorkshire at 0.7 1.0 science editor tom clarke on how the falling numbers of cases are an encouraging sign but the the question is if the next phase of easing the lockdown will lead to virus cases jumping back up again pm says uk will bounce back as economy plunges 20 % in april johnson shameful churchill statue has to be protected if the figure tips above one it means each person with covid-19 will infect more than one other person with the virus causing the spread to increase but experts cautioned against the use of regional r values the average number of people an infected to pass the disease on to saying that as the number of infections falls regional r values become less reliable instead from next week the government will publish the growth rates for regions that are based on data and make fewer assumptions boris johnson said there are complex issues about the risks the whole of the community faces regarding the r value with 80 % of infections existing in care homes or nosocomial infections within the nhs the crucial thing is really the overall rate of infections that we 're seeing the overall rate of infections in the country in the community the rates of new hospital admissions are very important and that 's when we 'll make the judgement on whether to relax lockdown further he said before relaxing lockdown further the government says there must be reliable data from sage showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board the latest update from sage suggests the rate of infection is not falling in every region of the uk putting step three for relaxing lockdown in jeopardy on july 4 the government hopes to reopen the hospitality industry so long as the five tests including a falling rate of infection and are being met crucial to the reopening of pubs restaurants and bars many in the industry say is a reduction of the two metre social distancing rule they say a two metre safe distance would make their business unviable while reducing it to one metre would make a huge difference many businesses in the industry say they 'd need three weeks to make their premises covid secure but with july 4 just a month away they will be hoping for progress in the government 's aim of reducing the r number the prime minister said at the moment two metres is right but we 're working with the scientists to work out a moment when the numbers of infection are down so far that we can really say that the two metre rule is no longer necessary support bubbles who can now meet up indoors from saturday failing to extend brexit transition reckless first ministers warn black lives matter protest called off over far right fears he said the government is keeping the two metre rule under review and obviously as we make further progress i hope to say more sir patrick has said with ons figures on friday showing the number of people with new infections is still declining and thus less chance of catching it it may influence political decisions to lower the distance figures from the ons show coronavirus mortality rates fell by more than half in all but two regions in england and wales between april and may. after increasing between march and april age standardised mortality rates fell in all regions by more than 50 % except the north east and yorkshire & the humber the office for national statistics ons said the greatest decrease was in london where the mortality rate fell by 83.3 % the r number rate of infection explained last week scientists at the university of cambridge warned the r number was above or at one in some regions of the uk the mrc biostatistics unit at cambridge university a body which helps public health england model and forecast coronavirus infections estimated the number to be 1.01 in the north west and 1 in the south west the government however has repeatedly insisted since the first lockdown relaxations that the number for the uk has remained below one it says the cambridge mrc biostatistics unit is one of several groups which models for the government and when considering all models the national number is below one the first ministers of scotland and wales have called for an extension to the brexit transition period warning it would be extraordinarily reckless to not do so in a letter to the prime minister nicola sturgeon and mark drakeford said fundamental issues still remain between the uk and eu negotiators after the most recent round of talks on a deal april was the cruelest month but recovery depends on trade offs between the economy and health boris johnson 's lockdown adjustment could 'cause huge problems in wales the scottish government has repeatedly called for the transition period to be extended beyond the december 31 deadline but that can only be done if a request is made before the end of this month itv news political correspondent daniel hewitt has more the uk government has previously rejected any calls for an extension ms sturgeon and mr drakeford warned in their letter that exiting the transition period at the end of this year when the uk economy will just be beginning its recovery from coronavirus would be extraordinarily reckless the first ministers wrote no one could reproach the uk government for changing its position in the light of the wholly unforeseeable covid-19 crisis particularly as the eu has made it clear it is open to an extension request we therefore call on you to take the final opportunity the next few weeks provide to ask for an extension to the transition period in order to provide a breathing space to complete the negotiations to implement the outcome and the opportunity for our businesses to find their feet after the enormous disruption of recent months at the time the withdrawal agreement was signed no one could have imagined the enormous economic dislocation which the covid 19 pandemic has caused in wales scotland the whole of the uk in the eu and across the world the letter claimed that at best there would only be a bare bones trade deal in place by december or a move to a no deal exit from the eu but in a tweet on friday cabinet office minister michael gove said he has formally confirmed to the eu the uk will not extend the brexit transition period the statement was made during a meeting of the eu joint committee mr gove said i formally confirmed the uk will not extend the transition period & the moment for extension has now passed on 1 january 2021 we will take back control and regain our political & economic independence he added boris johnson has warned violent protesters they will face the full force of the law after claiming black lives matter demonstrations are likely to end in deliberate and calculated violence he said it is absurd and shameful the statue of sir winston churchill in parliament square has to be boarded up ahead of protests this weekend the cenotaph and the churchill statue in westminster were defaced and spray painted during a black lives matter march through central london a growing minority unfortunately have hijacked them and they are using them as a pretext to attack the police to cause violence and to cause damage to public property my message to everybody is for all sorts of reasons they should not go the prime minister said you should not have a situation where people who are protesting on one basis are violently attacking the police and public property violent protesters warned they could face jail within 24 hours ahead of black lives matter and far right demonstrations oxford vice chancellor delighted to see students engage in blm debate he acknowledged the outrage people feel about racism but said the uk has made huge progress in fighting it i think this is a country that has made huge progress in tackling racism we should look sometimes at the positive stuff we ve got more young black and minority ethnic kids going to university than ever before more black kids doing the tougher subjects at school doing better than ever before in school he said protective fences have been placed around the memorials along with statues of gandhi and nelson mandela as the capital prepares for protests from the far right and anti - racism demonstrators mr johnson said police have already made hundreds of arrests in the last few days and they will make many more he said police can see the culprits because overwhelmingly they are being recorded with body worn cameras the metropolitan police have said they are ready to tackle violence directed at police or property following disorder at protests last weekend commander bas javid said both black lives matter protesters and right wing groups will be dealt with using the same tactics but urged people to make their voices heard in other ways such as social media he said do not come to london to protest in large groups because not only is that unlawful but you re putting yourself and other people at risk from a health perspective speaking to broadcasters mr johnson said we should not support a demonstration that is in all probability looking at what has happened before going to end in deliberate and calculated violence writing on twitter the prime minister said the statue of winston churchill in parliament square is a permanent reminder of his achievement in saving this country and the whole of europe from a fascist and racist tyranny it is absurd and shameful that this national monument should today be at risk of attack by violent protesters yes he sometimes expressed opinions that were and are unacceptable to us today but he was a hero and he fully deserves his memorial we can not now try to edit or censor our past we can not pretend to have a different history the statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations they had different perspectives different understandings of right and wrong but those statues teach us about our past with all its faults to tear them down would be to lie about our history and impoverish the education of generations to come mr johnson added the only responsible action was to stay away from planned protests this weekend as for the planned demonstrations we all understand the legitimate feelings of outrage at what happened in minnesota and the legitimate desire to protest against discrimination whatever progress this country has made in fighting racism and it has been huge we all recognise that there is much more work to do but it is clear that the protests have been sadly hijacked by extremists intent on violence the attacks on the police and indiscriminate acts of violence which we have witnessed over the last week are intolerable and they are abhorrent the only responsible course of action is to stay away from these protests officials anticipate the memorials could be a hot spot of clashes between anti - racism protesters and counter - demonstrators who have vowed to protect the sites the democratic football lads alliance called on supporters to travel to london to protect monuments after a number were vandalised in recent protests far right figure tommy robinson whose real name is stephen yaxley lennon has expressed his support a black lives matter protest due to take place in hyde park at 1 pm on saturday has reportedly been called off after organisers warned that many hate groups were targeting those planning to attend london mayor sadiq khan said he was extremely concerned about further protests in london particularly by extreme far right groups which advocate hatred and division could lead to violence and disorder mr khan said it is clear that the majority of the protesters have been peaceful this moment must be a catalyst for systemic lasting change to tackle the racism and inequalities that black people still face today in this country and elsewhere however i m extremely concerned that further protests in central london not only risk spreading covid-19 but could lead to disorder vandalism and violence he added staying home and ignoring them is the best response this weekend mr khan said he is working with the metropolitan police and partners to ensure statues and monuments at risk including the cenotaph winston churchill and nelson mandela are covered and protected scaffolding and a wooden covering was placed around the statue of winston churchill on thursday evening with the memorial in parliament square fenced off black lives matter protests have sparked debate in the uk about the position of historical figures associated with slavery and racism in bristol protesters tore down the statue of slave trader edward colston while dozens of other petitions and movements have demanded the removal of other statues linked to slavery across the country oxford university 's statue of cecil rhodes has once again become a focal point of anger among protesters for his links to the slave trade in east london the statue of slave owner robert milligan was taken down and in plymouth a public square named after a 16th century slave trade is to be renamed the city council said while in poole supporters of a controversial statue camped out overnight on thursday to ensure the memorial was not torn down and thrown into the sea robert baden powell had expressed sympathy towards hitler and the nazis when he was alive but supporters of the statue say it must stay put video report by itv news business and economics editor joel hills boris johnson vowed that the uk will bounce back after the economy shrunk by more than a fifth for the first full month of the coronavirus lockdown the office for national statistics said economic activity dropped by 20.4 per cent in april the largest drop in a single month since records began in 1997 the fall massively outstrips the then record 5.8 per cent drop in march gross domestic product gdp that the ons reported last month mps call for new autumn bank holiday and vat cut to help tourism firms uk was inundated by new coronavirus cases from abroad genetic analysis reveals it means that gdp fell by 10.4 per cent in the three months to april and sets the uk on course for one of its worst quarters in history speaking following the release of the figures mr johnson said he was not surprised the uk had been badly hit by the lockdown boris johnson says country will bounce back from lockdown economy hit the prime minister added one of the things the uk has got right is the way we 've tried to handle the situation with the furlough scheme and many other schemes we 've put in place what i want to do now is work slowly to get the economy back on its feet i think slowly confidence will return and you will see a bounce back he reiterated his general election promise to level up the country in education services and transport infrastructure and more plans would be announced in the coming weeks we 're going to be doubling down on our agenda of uniting and leveling up infrastructure technology investment in our future building the platform that business needs for growth he said itv news business and economics editor joel hills explains impact of gdp fall figures large parts of the british economy were placed on ice on march 23 when prime minister boris johnson told people they must stay inside and only leave the house when absolutely necessary the measures were announced to slow the spread of covid-19 the figures are worse than what some experts predicted a consensus compiled by pantheon macroeconomics suggested there would be a 18.7 per cent drop in gdp mays gdp figures are also likely to be hard hit before things start to ease again in june as the economy slowly reopens how the uk economy has shrunk health minister edward argar said that 's clearly a significant contraction it 's something i know the chancellor was aware was likely to happen given the impact of lockdown and restrictions on businesses and individuals but it is nonetheless a signicant contraction which is why we 've put in place one of the most generous schemes in the world of support for individuals and businesses but we also need to in careful measured ways to reopen the economy and get the country working again we need to be careful and reopen the economy to get the country working again health minister edward argar shadow chancellor anneliese dodds said what particularly concerns me is that actually we 're not just looking at one month of economic damage there was a report that came out a couple of days ago from the oecd and it suggested that the drop in gdp for this year for the uk would actually be worse than for every other industrialised nation so we 're in a very very difficult situation as a country and we will need strong action to help us climb out of this as quickly as possible we need strong action shadow chancellor anneliese dodds former chancellor ken clarke said he had sympathy for the government and that the majority of the next parliament would be focused on bringing economic prosperity back to the uk we 're in the middle of theworst recession in the lifetime of anyone living it 's quite different to any previous recession we 've had we have little to go on we have n't had a plague causing the economy to stop before so this is a very grave crisis i think we all realise that april was going to show up just how bad it was he added i think most of the rest of this parliament is going to be taken up with this struggle to get the economy back to decent health the idea we 're going to have a quick bounce back i personally would be very very surprised if that were to happen ken clarke doubts fast uk economy bounce back neil birrell chief investment officer at asset manager premier miton said all the economic data out of the uk for april showed the economy to be in awful shape in fact worse than expected other countries ' data is improving as lockdown eases and the concern is that the uk is getting left behind and as we are currently witnessing equity markets are very sensitive to any threat to recovery itv news business and economics editor joel hills said the downturn was unprecedented and that the uk had never seen anything like this itv news political correspondent paul brand tweeted covid-19 has hit the uk hard one of the worst death rates in the world and now one of the worst economic downturns jonathan athow deputy national statistician at the ons told bbc radio 4 's today programme that prior to lockdown the biggest fall they had seen in a single month was two per cent if you take march and april together the fall was 25 per cent so in two months the economy shrank by a quarter he said mr athow added that virtually every sector has been shrinking but said april was likely to be the low point of economic output he added it is really too early to know how quickly economic activity will recover in the coming months attention is beginning to turn to how businesses will get back on track while still trying to limit the spread of covid-19 tej parikh chief economist at the institute of directors said many businesses will still need support as lockdown slowly lifts "emergency loan schemes have helped stop firms collapsing but left many saddled with debt he said businesses will be reluctant to hire and spend on new projects as they repair their finances particularly as social distancing eats into demand and productivity firms will continue to face cashflow challenges in the months ahead coronavirus everything you need to know check the number of cases in your area with our interactive map listen and subscribe to our podcast all the coronavirus information you need in one place from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus a report with advice for government on how to protect bame communities from coronavirus will be published next week following anger at its omission from an initial release public health england phe said the recommendations will be published next week when submitted to ministers this follows their review that was published last week showing that covid-19 kills disproportionately high numbers of people from ethnic minorities it was criticised for lacking any recommendations cited in their original terms of reference for the review itv news reported on sunday that this perceived lack of action led to a letter from the british medical association bma and bame medical organisations to health secretary matt hancock and prime minister boris johnson on thursday one signatory of this letter told itv news 's roohi hasan mixed messages from the government have been extremely unhelpful and this has undermined trust and credibility within the bame community however the announcement of publication of the second part is much welcomed but bame organisations said their one outstanding priority is seeing the government guidance translated to action the british international doctors ' association told hasan it was glad to see the recommendations are forthcoming and has urged the equalities minister kemi badenoch to implement them as soon as possible half of pregnant women in hospital with covid-19 from bame background sources recently told itv news they believe race discrimination and structural inequalities which they said they raised in consultations with phe were not what was released another source told itv news these issues had been part of an initial draft of the review phe said in a statement the government commissioned phe to conduct an epidemiological review to analyse how different factors can impact on peoples health outcomes from covid-19 this was published in full on the 2nd june in parallel professor kevin fenton on phes behalf engaged with a significant number of individuals and organisations within the bame community to hear their views concerns and ideas about the impact of covid-19 on their communities yet when itv news asked about any further releases earlier this week a spokesperson for ms badenoch 's equalities department failed to mention it the department statement instead said we are now taking action on the initial findings from the recently published phe report which this government takes very seriously through this work we will be able to make a real difference to peoples lives and protect our communities from the impact of the coronavirus it 's been like a prison lockdown in london 's tower blocks the new report is credited to professor kevin fenton who phe had originally said would lead their whole review into the impact of covid-19 on ethnic minorities when it was announced on may 4 but when the review was published last week the organisation said prof fenton only contributed to the document it is unclear whether the information was intended to be released in two reports prof fenton addressed the phe review briefly during a recent webinar with health in hackney in which he said it had been a privilege to engage with 4,000 bame community members it 's the only time he has addressed the matter since the report 's release prof fenton said the four key issues which emerged from the dialogue were social inequalities occupational risk underlying health problems like diabetes and structural issues like racism and discrimination the pa news agency has verified the deaths of 166 frontline uk healthcare workers with covid-19 since the start of march this year of those 100 workers came from bame backgrounds while 39 23 % were white and 27 16 % were of unknown ethnic origin a scientist who had been asked to peer review the as yet unpublished recommendations file told itv news people 's efforts had been spoiled professor raj bhopal from the university of edinburgh criticised the conduct over the report titled beyond the data understanding the impact of covid-19 on black asian and minority ethnic bame communities professor raj bhopal told itv news in the context of the pandemic there s one thing that matters above everything else trust there has to be trust between the government the professionals and the public my mother used to say a cup of milk takes a lot of work to make however it only takes one drop of lemon to spoil it that is what has happened here so much great work has been spoiled because of the lack of communication the earlier findings from public health england phe said that people of bangladeshi heritage were dying at around twice the rate of white britons why are more bame medics dying than their white colleagues it also found that other minority ethnic groups were at up to 50 % higher risk of dying but the document was criticised for not including any safeguarding measures labour has called the incident a scandal and yet another in a litany of failures to support bame communities during covid-19 marsha de cordova labours shadow women and equalities secretary added the government must now urgently publish these recommendations in full and provide an explanation for

presenter on the station since january 2017 earlier this week he compared black lives matter protesters to the taliban and said the people who tore down the statue of slave trader edward colston were a violent mob on sunday he tweeted a new form of the taliban was born in the uk today unless we get moral leadership quickly our cities wo nt be worth living in he also clashed with piers morgan on itvs good morning britain when he described colston as a philanthropist and said the people who tore down his statue in bristol were a far left marxist organisation in a statement the broadcaster said nigel farages contract with lbc is up very shortly and following discussions with him nigel is stepping down from lbc with immediate effect we thank nigel for the enormous contribution he has made to lbc and wish him well residents vow to protect scout founder statue with nazi link asked if the decision to step down was related to the controversy surrounding his recent comments a spokesman for the station declined to comment the departure of mr farage comes after presenters at radio station capital xtra which shares parent company global radio with lbc criticised global for its response to black lives matter breakfast show hosts yinka bokinni and shayna marie birch campbell reportedly said they were embarrassed by statements on race issued by the company according to the guardian the pair wrote a joint statement on an internal discussion board saying its upsetting to receive messages from black people who work in the company who are scared of coming forward and at first we were nt even sure if this was a forum for presenters to share their opinions but honestly we do nt know what else to do mr farage has courted controversy as a politician and a presenter over the years and his show has sparked multiple ofcom investigations last year he engaged in a heated clash with a caller over the prospect of the creation of an eu army asking him when will you stop lying ofcom also assessed comments he made on the show about the refugee crisis when he referred to sweden as the rape capital of europe mr farage has been a prominent supporter of donald trump and boosted his own profile across the atlantic during frequent appearances at the republicans rallies during the last us election campaign the pairs friendship was a boon for the radio station when he conducted a half hour interview with mr trump in october last year lbc is home to a number of outspoken commentators including nick ferrari james obrien and as of april the prime ministers sister rachel johnson black

health secretary matt hancock says people had a civic duty to work with the nhs test and trace system describing it as the radar for tracking coronavirus at the downing street press conference he said the system would continue to improve and he was confident it will be world class mr hancock said testing for the virus and tracing how it spreads is critical for containing it locally so that we can ease the national lockdown its by isolating the virus that we can control it and we can stop it spreading through our communities in this plan to lift lockdown test and trace is our radar if you like it helps us identify where the virus is and trace how it is spreading through the community mr hancock did not rule out the prospect of making it mandatory to abide the the test and trace rules the first set of results for the new system which has been described as critical in the fight against coronavirus were released on thursday showing that only one third of people who test positive were contactable some 8,117 people who tested positive for covid-19 in england had their case transferred to the test and trace contact tracing system of whom 5,407 67 % were reached while 2,710 33 % were not reached baroness dido harding who is heading up the nhs test and trace programme said the scheme had got off to a good start she said given that it is still early days this is really encouraging it means that the vast majority of people are responding positively and willingly sharing information and self isolating when needed our first week of data shows this partnership between the public and the nhs has got off to a good start but together we know there are further improvements we can make to the system itv news science editor tom clarke analyses the latest statistics and what is next for test and trace mr hancock said the delayed contact tracing app will be brought in when its right to do so as we launched nhs test and trace we were clear we want to embed this system and get confidence that people are following the advice that s given by human beings before introducing the technological element originally it was said the app could be ready for mid - may so it is a large climb down from the government as it not yet fit to be released a month later cancer referrals down 60 % due to coronavirus nhs england figures reveal two metre restriction could be cut to help

statement aimed at those planning to partake in black lives matter protests in the coming days i understand that people want to show their passion for a cause that they care deeply about but this is a virus that thrives on social contact regardless of what your cause may be mr hancock also denied it was dangerous to be easing the lockdown no its not and the first thing i would say is i have confidence and renewed confidence with these statistics that we will get a world class system the better test and trace is the more lockdown measures we can relieve safely but i m confident that the measures we ve announced to be able to relieve on saturday for the social measures and on monday for the retail measures they re safe they re part of the plan were coming out of lockdown carefully and

from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus housing secretary robert jenrick has been accused of unlawfully approving a bid by a tory donor to build a development of 1,500 homes that was said to be worth 1 billion the westferry printworks redevelopment scheme in east london was approved controversially in january by mr jenrick against the recommendation of a planning inspector the decision has since been reversed after legal action by tower hamlets council which had voiced concerns over the size of the development when the plans were first submitted in 2018 in a statement in may the local authority said the timing of the decision appeared to show bias by the cabinet minister as it was made a day before new infrastructure charges came into force allowing the developer former daily express owner richard desmonds northern and shell firm to avoid paying between 30 - 50 million extra to the council mr jenrick has rejected the suggestion there was any bias a downing street spokesman said adding how the prime minister has full confidence in the housing secretary the spokesman also said he was not aware of any plans to investigate the issue labour had requested mr jenrick attend the house of commons on thursday morning to face a grilling over his decision to force through the redevelopment scheme in east london but he avoided questions by sending junior housing minister christopher pincher labour has previously accused mr jenrick of making the decision after he dined with mr desmond at a glitzy fundraising dinner two weeks after the cabinet minister stepped in to approve the housing scheme electoral commission records show that mr desmond personally gave 12,000 to the conservatives in the commons labour shadow communities minister steve reed asked did he know he was helping mr desmond dodge a potential 50 million tax bill he added by an astonishing coincidence just two weeks after the secretary of state took his decision mr desmond made a generous donation of 12,000 to the conservative party this sequence of events raises grave concerns about cash for favours to ensure transparency and restore trust he said mr jenrick must immediately publish all documents and all correspondence related to this decision cancer referrals down 60 % due to coronavirus figures reveal pm considering cutting 2 m rule to help schools and pubs oronation street resumes filming after 11 weeks in lockdown the public needs reassurance that the integrity of the planning process can not be auctioned off at conservative party fundraising dinners former channel 5 owner mr desmond has donated to both the tories and ukip in the past mr reed asked why the development had been approved despite the objections of the local council and the independent planning inspector appointed by his own department the frontbencher also asked whether mr jenrick declared his dinner conversation with mr desmond to the permanent secretary the most senior civil servant at the ministry of housing communities and local government and why he did not recuse himself from decision making in this case given his relationship with the developer answering on behalf of mr jenrick housing minister pincher said the housing secretary acted properly and with propriety over the westferry development he told mps he mr reed also asks has he acted properly and with propriety in making clear to the department all the discussions he has had with applicants yes he did at all times he has disclosed any conversations that he has had with applicants he added mr jenrick has no relationship with the applicant so i think that question is irrelevant liberal democrat acting leader ed davey has written a letter to the cabinet secretary mark sedwill asking him to investigate whether mr jenrick broke the ministerial code there are serious questions for the government to answer about what robert jenrick knew and when he knew it the information that is now in the public domain suggests that there may have been a breach of the ministerial code which is why i am asking the cabinet secretary to launch an immediate investigation if this investigation finds that mr jenrick has broken the code then he must resign immediately mr pincher defending his boss said in the commons that ministers have no knowledge of funds which are provided to political parties through donations or through payment for tickets these are spendings made by donors which go to parties of all persuasions they are declared in the proper and usual way none of this is known to ministers none of it is discussed by ministers it certainly was nt discussed on this occasion labour also wants more information about the level of contact his department had with the developer over the application and specifically about the tens of millions of pounds that it would have been liable for after january 14 if he had nt intervened mr reed said its time for mr jenrick to come clean and answer these crucial questions about why he overruled his own inspector to grant planning permission for a billionaire conservative party donor to build a luxury development and dodge a 50 million tax bill shortly after they dined together at a glitzy fundraising dinner mr jenrick must prove its not one rule for the conservatives and their wealthy donors but another rule for everyone else labour mp for wigan lisa nandy has told itv of the frustrations the public have faced when trying to democratically remove statues which hark back to the uk 's links to slavery and imperialism speaking on the peston show about the toppling of the statue of slave trader edward colston in bristol the shadow foreign secretary said why was that statue removed the way it was because for 20 years they could n't reach a consensus and could n't get anything done she said the public has called for change but a lack of response from those in power highlighted the issue calls for statues of cecil rhodes sir thomas picton and robert clive linked to slave trade and oppression to be removed statues buildings and streets across the uk that commemorate the slave trade ms nandy said the truth is we should be having a real debate about who we celebrate and the values we reflect as a country and we should be able to remove statues by democratic means and erect new ones but here is the thing why was that statue removed in the way that it was removed because for 20 years protesters and campaigners had used every democratic lever at their disposal petitions meetings protests trying to get elected politicians to act and they could n't reach a consensus and they could n't get anything done ms nandy continued now this is reflective of what has happened to people of colour in this country and across the world for a very long time we 've had seven reviews into racial discrimination in this country in the last three years alone and very few of those recommendations have actually been acted on that is why people are so frustrated and that is the question we should be asking ourselves is why is it so difficult so so many people to be heard and pull the democratic levers to see the change that they need ms nandy said i think there is n't really anyone in britain certainly not many people who think we should be celebrating slavery and people involved in the slave trade in this day and age and i think there is grounds for consensus on this also on peston was tory mp for haltemprice and howden david davis agreed that statues of those involved in the slave trade were wrong but said i do feel that they are over doing it when they take gladstone out when his father made money from slaves before adding there 's got to be balances here ms nandy also hit back at mr davis over his comments truth be told i walk past statues everyday and do n't look at any of them she said i know david but your ancestors probably were n't enslaved and there is a level of pain here there has been some argument over the removal of the statue of colston with police in bristol saying they will treat its being pulled down as criminal damage however labour mp for brent central dawn butler said she could understand why demonstrators did what they did i do n't think they were completely wrong i think the activists have been fighting for many years probably over a decade to get the statue removed and for the statue to be put into a museum and that did n't happen so they made it happen and i do n't think they were completely wrong when asked about the significance of this movement rapper tinchy stryder said i would n't say this feels different it 's just a new timeline and people are online more so things get captured more the british rapper added it does n't feel like anybody is trying to step back and i do n't think they should it 's not a trend this is real life issues ms butler added ultimately if we want to ensure that this struggle does n't carry on we have dismantle the systemic racial barriers that exist it exists in every single workplace the next stage is very uncomfortable and we can not back down from those conversations if we want to see lasting change mr davis told itv news ' political editor robert peston he does n't think the government is yet in the right place for tackling the coronavirus pandemic and criticised what he said was a slow start from the government in terms of testing when asked about the public 's trust in the government and how it has reduced since the start of the year mr davis said the government needed to concede when mistakes are made it 's a course of wisdom if you 're pretending you can get everything right ms butler also criticised the government 's response to the virus outbreak she said we were still behind other countries and we could have learnt from their experiment ms butler said that the government were quite arrogant before adding that the government is still pretending that they are getting everything right when that 's not the case mr davis who was the former brexit secretary when theresa may was prime minister told robert peston that we will get a brexit deal he said they take it to the 11th hour we will get a deal quite frankly it 's too harmful to both sides to not have a deal and unfortunately you have to go to the brink to get a deal he added that there would be an additional cost and it would effect the british economy if they deferred or delayed the deal again he said look back at the last time where we deferred in the entire period to the brexit and there was uncertainty the same would happen here and there would be extra costs we know what we want as they said it 's oven ready barnier is not working on anything else we will get a deal video report by itv news political correspondent daniel hewitt people living alone will be allowed to meet with one other household from saturday the prime minister has announced in an attempt to make lockdown less lonely and more bearable boris johnson said single adult households will be able form a support bubble with one other household and act as if they all live together meaning they will not have to observe social distancing rules it means the two metre rule will be bypassed for those within a bubble and even overnight stays will be permitted once a single adult household has formed a bubble it must remain exclusive meaning people will not be allowed to swap which household they meet with the rule also applies to single parents with children under 18 if any member of a bubble develops coronavirus symptoms they must all follow self isolation rules the person with symptoms must stay indoors for seven days while all others will need to quarantine for 14 days the prime minister said the change was being made to support those who are particularly lonely as a result of lockdown measures it is a targeted intervention to limit the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions he added it means elderly who live alone will be able meet with one of their children while single parents could form a bubble with their parents in order to share childcare couples who live apart will finally be allowed to be within two metres of each other and spend the night together but mr johnson warned this new freedom is emphatically not designed for people who do not live alone to start meeting inside other peoples homes he said that remains against the law video report on support bubbles from itv news political correspondnt romilly weeks there s no limit on how far someone can travel to meet another household but the rule only applies in england meaning people will not be able to cross borders within the uk those shielding are advised to continue doing so and should not meet other people the prime minister said however more will be announced for shielders next week mr johnson admitted people will find anomalies in what the guidance says can and can not be done but said that 's inevitable when were only able to give people a small amount of the freedoms that they usually enjoy at the press conference the prime minister was repeatedly asked about a comment by a government scientific adviser that imposing lockdown a week earlier could have halved the uk 's death toll neil ferguson professor of mathematical biology at imperial college london speaking to the science and technology committee said the epidemic was doubling every three to four days before lockdown interventions were introduced so had we introduced lockdown measures a week earlier we would have reduced the final death toll by at least a half mr johnson said questions about what could have been done differently were premature and declined to say he regretted not ordering lockdown sooner chris whitty england 's chief medical adviser said part of the problem that we had at that stage is that we had very limited information about this virus he added the nature of new epidemics is very often they come in waves circling around the world and if we get hit by another wave at that point we need to understand better what is the optimal mix of things we could do mr johnson was speaking just hours after being accused by labour leader keir starmer of flailing around trying to blame others over the u - turn on the reopening of schools he told the press conference he has a very big plan to bring all children back to school in september he said there would be a huge amount of catch up work so pupils get help during the summer and the autumn and beyond the government 's ambition was that primary schools could also fully reopen on june 15 however it was announced on tuesday that plan had been abandoned the u - turn came amid speculation that regional r numbers the reproduction rate of covid-19 had tipped above one however that rumour was dispelled by sir patrick valance england 's top scientific adviser insisted the r number was below one but perhaps only just below one in some areas he said ministers must be prepared to reverse any upward turn in the r number which importantly means looking for outbreaks locally and dealing with those fast referring to data from the office for national statistics he said about 6 - 7 % of the population was thought to have had contracted coronavirus while 53,000 were thought to be infected between may 17 and 30 the prime minister admitted that the uks coronavirus infection rate was not as low as he would have hoped there are still 53,000 people who have it the r is only just below one we have 30,000 or more new cases per week it is not down as low as i would like and i have to be very mindful of the risk of new outbreaks the update follows the announcement that zoos safari parks and drive in cinemas will join some non - essential retail shops in reopening on june 15 despite the government conceding it was too early to open schools chancellor rishi sunak earlier insisted it would be safe to go shopping at non - essential retail stores when they reopen on monday pubs restaurants and bars which will not be allowed to reopen before july 4 will welcome speculation that the two metre rule could soon be reduced to one metre at prime ministers questions boris johnson said the rule was under constant review and as the incidence of coronavirus declined the statistical likelihood of being infected no matter how close or far you are from somebody who may or may not have coronavirus goes down mr johnson is under pressure to reduce the distance in order to help businesses reopen amid concerns about the economic impact of the restriction watch boris johnson 's press conference in full video report by itv news political correspondent daniel hewitt sir keir starmer has accused the prime minister of flailing around trying to blame others over the government 's u - turn on the reopening of schools the labour leader said the government plans for schools lie in tatters after the education secretary announced the ambition for primary schools to fully reopen on monday had been abandoned the plan had been for all remaining primary age pupils to return to school for a month before the summer holidays to join reception year 1 and year 6 pupils many of whom went back on june 1 amid reports the coronavirus reproduction rate r value had tipped over one in the north west many councils had already said they would not allow their schools to reopen before the government confirmed the plans were scrapped sir keir said the move to pause the reopening of schools would mean inequality will now go up itv news political correspondent daniel hewitt explains there are concerns on both sides of the house parents have lost confidence in the governments approach millions of children will miss six months worth of schooling he said it 's time the prime minister took responsibility for his own failures boris johnson hit back saying the labour leader should make up his mind about schools after suggesting at last week 's pmqs it was not yet safe sir keir insisted he wants as many children to go back to school as soon as possible when it is safe adding i ve been saying that like a broken record for weeks on end i know the prime minister has got rehearsed attack lines but he should look at what i ve been saying consistently he added how several weeks ago he had suggested setting up a national taskforce so everyone could put their shoulder to the wheel and he urged the pm to take up the suggestion mr johnson said he could do with support from sir keir on the reopening of schools from his friends in the left wing trade unions plans abandoned to fully reopen primary schools before term end some non - essential shops will reopen on june 15 business secretary announces coronavirus zoos among lockdown measures eased but schools reopening delayed sir keir said the uk is the outlier compared to other countries in returning children to school telling the commons its no good the prime minister flailing around trying to blame others andrew clewer is headteacher at landywood primary school he said teachers would love more children back at the school but social distancing restrictions limit the numbers they can allow the school in staffordshire has adapted to socially distanced learning in a number of ways including outdoor commando lessons at a safe two metre distance mr clewer said being away from school will have that negative impact on pupils but added systems are in place to keep children engaged through individual teaching and communication with parents also at pmqs sir keir urged the prime minister to turbocharge a response to protect bame groups from coronavirus he pointed to the black lives matter movement and said the uk must implement recommendations from three reports the lammy review on outcomes for bame groups in the criminal justice system the report on the windrush scandal and the most recent report on coronavirus and ethnic minorities mr johnson said he was getting on with the implementation of the recommendations and already acting we 're are looking at the particular exposure of black and minority ethnic groups to coronavirus and be in no doubt they ve been at the forefront in the struggle against coronavirus whether its in the nhs or public transport the prime minister said he said the first and most practical step was to ensure that those high contact professions get expanded and targeted testing now i understand the very strong and legitimate feelings of people in this country at the death of george floyd and of course i agree that black lives matter he said but he added how it 's absolutely vital that authorities keep the streets safe and that we back our police sir keir pressed the pm to extend the national voucher scheme to ensure free meals over the summer for vulnerable children or risk further inequality in england mr johnson replied we do nt normally continue with free school meals over the summer holidays but were also aware of the particular difficulties faced by vulnerable families that s why were announcing a further 63 million of local welfare assistance to be used by local authorities at their discretion to help the most vulnerable families it will be safe for people to go shopping when some non - essential retail reopens on monday the chancellor has insisted ministers are pressing ahead with plans to reopen non - essential retail despite concerns about a rising coronavirus r number reproduction rate that saw many school in the north west declare they would not fully reopen on monday as the government had planned following pressure from schools parents unions politicians and councils the government announced it would abandon its plans to fully reopen primary schools for a month before the summer holidays plans abandoned to fully reopen primary schools before term end some non - essential shops will reopen on june 15 business secretary announces coronavirus zoos among lockdown measures eased but schools reopening delayed hours later it was announced the planned reopening of some shops would go ahead so long as they had made their business covid secure shops must have put measures in place to allow social distancing on premises before they can reopen and any business which opens without following guidelines can be issued enforcement notices it was announced at tuesday evening 's press conference chancellor rishi sunak visiting a john lewis store said extraordinary steps had been taken to ensure people can shop in confidence knowing that its going to be safe among the measures in place are a one way system a limit on the number of people who can be in the store at any one time signage a new process for returns and social distancing the chancellor said all of that creates a new shopping environment that wo n't be the same as what we 're all used to and it 's an environment that means you can shop in confidence he added alok sharma told the government 's daily coronavirus press conference this is the latest step in the careful restarting of our economy which he claims will enable high streets up and down the country to spring back to life another step set to be formally announced later by boris johnson is the reopening of zoos safari parks and drive in cinemas which will also open on june 15 a downing street official said people are continuing to make huge sacrifices to reduce the spread of coronavirus and avoid a second spike but we know it is tough and where we can safely open up more attractions and it is supported by the science we will do so any business that opens must complete a covid-19 specific risk assessment and take the necessary steps to manage those risks as is the legal obligation he said mr sharma said the government is following its roadmap which sets out the ambition to reopen other business such as restaurants pubs and bars as well as hairdressers barbers nail bars and related services by july 4 at the earliest but questions remain as to how schools may return to normal with the government working to bring all children back to school in september children in nursery reception year 1 and year 6 in england began returning to primary school last week after the government eased lockdown measures but some schools said they did not have enough space on site to admit all pupils in the eligible year groups while adhering to government guidance to limit class sizes to 15 and encourage fewer interactions boris johnson is set to announce the reopening of zoos safari parks and drive in cinemas from june 15 but children will have to wait until at least september to go back to school it comes after business secretary alok sharma confirmed shops would also be able to reopen on the same day as the government seeks to kick start the economy following the coronavirus lockdown but education secretary gavin williamson was forced to admit defeat over plans for all primary pupils in england to attend classes before the summer break zoos and drive in cinemas to reopen in england from june 15 boris johnson to say uk coronavirus death toll rises by 286 to 40,883 meanwhile health officials have warned that around 10million people will be on the waiting list for nhs treatment by the end of 2020 more than double the current figure due to a combination of social distancing measures a backlog of treatments and staffing shortages mr johnson who is to face off with labour leader sir keir starmer at prime ministers questions will reopen outdoor attractions where people remain in their cars such as safari parks and drive in cinemas because the risk of spreading the disease is lower outside a downing street official said people are continuing to make huge sacrifices to reduce the spread of coronavirus and avoid a second spike but we know it is tough and where we can safely open up more attractions and it is supported by the science we will do so questions remain as to how schools may return to normal as a number of councils including in the north west of england have opposed plans to reopen amid new data which suggested covid-19 may still be spreading in the region children in nursery reception year 1 and year 6 in england began returning to primary school last week after the government eased lockdown measures but some schools said they did not have enough space on site to admit all pupils in the eligible year groups while adhering to government guidance to limit class sizes to 15 and encourage fewer interactions mr williamson said the government would like to see schools who have the capacity bring back more pupils where possible before the summer break but conceded the government was working to bring all children back to school in september shops will only be able to reopen if they have completed a covid-19 risk assessment and can implement social distancing measures but other businesses including pubs restaurants and hairdressers will remain shut until july 4 at the earliest mr sharma said it comes as hospitality chiefs have warned the rule requiring people to stay two metres apart could jeopardise firms ability to reopen with some asking for the distance to be halved mr sharma said the rule was being kept under review and when it is safe to do so we will see whether you can move to a shorter distance meanwhile projections by the nhs confederation show that the combined effects of keeping up social distancing the backlog of treatments and challenges around staffing mean the list is expected to rise from around 4.2 million currently to around 10 million by christmas the confederation which represents health and care leaders said the figures came from its most realistic scenario which assumes the health service makes a steady return to full capacity within the next 12 months the pessimistic scenario assumes a second wave of covid-19 and a lack of treatments or a vaccine pushing the waiting list to around 11 million by the end of the year the most optimistic scenario assumes a faster return to normal where the waiting list will be around eight million by the end of the year the confederation published a new report warning the health service in england faces an uphill battle as it continues to manage thousands of sick and recovering covid-19 patients while also trying to restart services such as those for cancer stroke and heart disease the health leaders called on the government to prepare the public not to expect the same level of service for many months adding that some staff were so exhausted and traumatised from caring

the coronavirus information you need in one place from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus the death of george floyd a black man who died in minnesota after a police officer knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes has sparked protests across the world with many demonstrating against police brutality and racial inequality mr floyd 's death has rung true with the experience faced by many today at anti - racism protests across the uk this week peaceful protesters held up signs of black and ethnic minority bame people whose deaths have been linked to the police including cynthia jarrett and mark duggan both who died in tottenham the north london district has a long and complicated history with race relations met police chief cressida dick london 's officers are not targeting young black men broadwater farm riots following the death of cynthia jarrett a black woman who died of a heart attack during a police search of her home on october 4 1985 riots broke out on the broadwater farm council estate in tottenham those within the local community had become incensed by what was perceived as the unfair treatment of black people tensions in the ethnically diverse community were already fraught due to a combination of local issues and the brixton riots in south london following the death of dorothy groce a black woman who was shot by police during a search just a week earlier a night of rioting on october 6 1985 saw violence break out as riot police tried to clear the streets petrol bombs and bricks were thrown while cars and homes were badly damaged during the melee it culminated in more than 50 police officers being injured and the murder of pc keith blakelock who was stabbed to death by some rioters the broadwater farm riots were highlighted by many of those who took to the streets during the black lives matter protests this week mark duggans death mark duggan was shot dead by police in tottenham in 2011 the 29-year old was shot and killed in tottenham after armed officers intercepted the minicab in which he was travelling on the basis of intelligence that he was carrying a gun a handgun was later found about seven metres away from the minicab an inquest jury in 2014 found mark duggan was lawfully killed his death sparked riots in tottenham and across the country confusion has surrounded mr duggan 's death for years and has had a lasting effect on both the local community and across the uk at protests in recent days demonstrators carried handmade placards listing mark duggan and the names of others who have died in police custody or following contact with officers many chanted no justice no peace no racist police and carrying signs which read the uk is not innocent deaths in police custody according to analysis of official statistics by inquest a charity which looks into state related deaths there have been 1,741 deaths in police custody or following contact with officers in england and wales since 1990 of those who died 14 % were bame which is proportionate to the population as of the 2011 census yet inquest believes force is more of a factor in the deaths of bame people in police custody as opposed to them dying of natural causes or taking their own lives bame people die disproportionately as a result of use of force or restraint by the police raising serious questions of institutional racism as a contributory factor in their deaths a report by inquest said stop and search black people were more than five times more likely to be stopped and searched in london than white people in 2018/19 figures show a greater proportion of those were searched under section 60 a power which does not require officers to have suspicion in order to search people in 2018 tottenham mp david lammy accused police of racial profiling and unfairly targeting young black men last week metropolitan police commissioner dame cressida dick dismissed suggestion officers unfairly target black people amid accusations aimed at the force following george floyds death and black lives matter protests in the uk ms dick said there was a distinction between the us and the uk in terms of history its culture and policing models she told itv news i completely refute a suggestion that this is because the officers are targeting for example young black men we 're policing in areas where violence is high we 're trying to protect people we are highly accountable we 're highly scrutinised while distrust in police from the community may partially stem from stop and search depravation in the area remains an issue i completely refute a suggestion that this is because the officers are targeting young black men ' what is the makeup of tottenham a report published by haringey council showed that the borough is the fourth most deprived area in london and ranked 49th out of 317 local authorities in england the average wage of workers in tottenham is around 20 % lower than the london average but house prices continue to rise in the last 10 years house prices in tottenham have almost doubled in 2010 the average house price was just over 223,000 in 2010 that figure now stands at 448,109 according to estate agents foxtons tottenham is one of the most ethnically diverse areas of london with 38 % of residents from bame groups in the london borough of haringey in which brent is in more than 180 languages are spoken investment and improvement have been welcome with city hall pledging 28 million to regenerate tottenham and lead the revitalisation of an area marked by decades of decline and scarred by 2011s riots less than a fifth of deaths registered in the week ending may 29 in england and wales involved coronavirus the lowest proportion since the week lockdown was imposed figures show there were 9,824 deaths registered in the week ending may 29 a fall from the previous week but still 1,653 deaths higher than what would usually be expected the office for national statistics ons said of these 1,822 involved covid-19 18.5 % of the total that week and the lowest number of weekly coronavirus deaths for eight weeks despite deaths continuing to fall there are still around 20 % more weekly deaths than the average for normal times and the death toll for the uk is now at least 45,000 new coronavirus social care taskforce set up to focus on stopping infection the total for england and wales is 45,748 before adding on deaths in northern ireland and scotland the total number of excess deaths has passed 63,500 with tuesdays figures showing 57,961 excess deaths in england and wales between march 21 and may 29 2020 added together with the numbers of excess deaths for scotland and northern ireland published last week the total number of excess deaths in the uk across this period now stands at 63,596 no coronavirus deaths in scotland for second consecutive day uk coronavirus death toll at lowest level since march all figures are based on death registrations in the week ending may 29 there were 819 more deaths in care homes compared with the five year average and 30 fewer deaths in hospitals it is also the first time the proportion of weekly coronavirus deaths has fallen to under a fifth since the week lockdown was imposed the week ending march 27 when the virus accounted for 5 % of the deaths while numbers are falling there have been tens of thousands of excess deaths compared to the average number of deaths over five years for the same period when the us stock market recovered all its covid-19 losses last night and moved into positive territory i was filled with as much dread as reassurance because just like what happened after the 2008 banking debacle we have an economic and financial rescue that has bailed out those who typically own assets and has therefore widened inequalities again especially the gap between younger people in insecure employment and boomers the older generation my generation who hold most of the shares and property to be clear within our financialised global economic system after the coronavirus started laying waste to health and prosperity there was no remedial alternative than to slash interest rates to zero and create mind boggling quantities of new money with the express purpose of stimulating asset inflation and shoring up the confidence of businesses and consumers channel tunnel operator warns pm vital supply chain put at risk by home office quarantine rules peston what is the government doing to protect us from second wave and second lockdown but what is disturbing almost horrifying is the sheer speed with which share prices have returned to where they were the sore point is that we are just at the start of witnessing the devastation of the incomes and living standards of poorer and younger people as government measures to sustain employment through furlough schemes and their overseas equivalents are gradually withdrawn entire industries from hospitality pubs and restaurants to travel to energy employing millions are being devastated but in the vast ocean of global financial markets they are plankton and their destruction is trivial compared to the onward march of the tech whales and monsters we face an autumn and winter of high and rising unemployment and proliferating poverty throughout the rich west even in the us where joblessness remains at a post - war high and where the recent fall in numbers claiming unemployment looks like a statistical solecism all this grotesque inequality is becoming more conspicuous in an era where its a cliche that even in healthy times a tech driven financialised globalised economy creates a profoundly unfair chasm between the insecure poor and the wealthy to be clear and well before the black lives matters protests the governments behavioural scientists and the police who advise ministers through the sage committee were already warning that the curbs on our freedoms to suppress the dreadful virus would foment social unrest that risk is hardly lessened when those with no assets or savings worry what kind of paid employment will still exist in a world of semi - permanent social distancing and when they see the accumulated wealth restored not just of billionaires but also of all those lucky enough to have a pension pot and a home the harm to health from this virus rises exponentially with age but the income and wealth toll is viciously greater for the young anti - racism demonstrators are planning to gather in london as george floyd is laid to rest in the us after a killing boris johnson said had awakened an incontrovertible undeniable feeling of injustice worldwide mr floyd who died after a police officer in minneapolis restrained him by holding a knee on his neck will be buried in his home town of houston in texas on tuesday a symbolic and socially distanced commemoration is planned at the nelson mandela statue in parliament square in london at 5 pm organised by stand up to racism following protests across the uk on the weekend the prime minister who had previously condemned the thuggery by a minority that marred some demonstrations acknowledged many of the activists concerns were founded on a cold reality he said leaders simply ca nt ignore concerns that black asian and minority ethnic bame groups face discrimination in education employment and in law in the video statement released by downing street on monday evening he said in this country and around the world his mr floyds dying words i ca nt breathe have awakened an anger and a widespread and incontrovertible undeniable feeling of injustice a feeling that people from black and minority ethnic groups do face discrimination in education in employment in the application of the criminal law and we who lead and who govern simply ca nt ignore those feelings because in too many cases i am afraid they will be founded on a cold reality still the pm said those who harmed police or property would face the full force of the law after campaigners pulled down the statue of slave trader edward colston in bristol graffiti was scrawled on the sir winston churchill statue in parliament square and nearly 50 london police officers were injured mr johnson warned legal repercussions must follow and called for people to work peacefully lawfully to defeat racism he added he could not condone people breaking social distancing rules aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus which he acknowledged was disproportionately harming bame communities so no i will not support those who flout the rules on social distancing for the obvious reason that we risk a new infection at a critical time and just as we have made huge progress he said the mayor of london flagged further progress on tuesday morning when he announced the citys landmarks would be reviewed to ensure they reflect the capitals diversity sadiq khan said the commission for diversity in the public realm will review the citys landmarks including murals street art street names statues and other memorials and consider which legacies should be celebrated before making recommendations meanwhile stand up to racism co - convenor sabby dhalu said of tuesday evenings planned commemoration in london the uprising of black communities and others against racism since george floyd was killed must lead to transformation against racial discrimination we demand justice bristols police chief defended his officers for not stopping protesters pulling down the colston statue saying had they attempted to make arrests there would have been a very violent confrontation it comes as the times newspaper reported home secretary priti patel who condemned the actions of a minority of protesters as shameful had a firm conversation with the forces chief constable andy marsh in which she demanded an explanation for what had happened in his video speech mr johnson praised his own record in politics citing work to recruit and promote more young black people and noted his chancellor rishi sunak and ms patel were of indian heritage hundreds line up for george floyds memorial in houston statues buildings and streets that commemorate slave trade mr sunak had earlier said that as a british asian of course he knows racism still exists in the uk but he promised peaceful protesters that although their progress felt slow they were helping to make a permanent change meanwhile a council has committed to removing part of a racist pub sign which has been likened to a gollywog with immediate effect after mounting pressure from campaigners thousands of people signed a petition demanding the removal of a caricature of a black man above the 18th century greenman pub sign in ashbourne derbyshire a new coronavirus social care taskforce has been set up to stop the spread of the virus among all people who receive care the government 's daily covid-19 press conference has heard david pearson the newly appointed chairman of the national covid-19 social care support taskforce said our focus will be on stopping infection whilst trying to ensure the wellbeing of all people who receive care and support whether they live in care homes or at home he acknowledged the crisis in care homes which has seen several thousand vulnerable people die of coronavirus since the pandemic reached the uk he said the taskforce will bring together the concerted and determined actions of both local and central government in order to protect care home staff and residents many of whom are considered extremely clinically vulnerable statistics have shown those over the age of 80 are 70 % more likely to die of the virus than working age britons bristol mayor says slave trader statue was a personal affront uk coronavirus death toll at lowest level since march thousands more may have died with covid-19 without being diagnosed data reveals to further protect the group health secretary matt hancock announced an extension of the coronavirus testing regime to include all staff and residents at all adult care homes in england the service will benefit residents and staff in over 6,000 more care homes he said previously only care homes exclusively housing the over-65s were eligible for facility wide testing of staff and residents it will mean that right across adult social care everyone will have the certainty and confidence of a high quality coronavirus test whether symptomatic or not since the launch of whole care home testing the government says it has provided 1,071,103 test kits to 8,984 care homes chair of the taskforce mr pearson said it will play an important part in ensuring we are doing everything we can to reduce the risk of transmission of covid-19 in the sector both for those who rely on care and support and the social care workforce it is made up of representatives from phe cqc care providers alliance lga adass healthwatch england mhclg cabinet office and dhsc responding to a question from itv news political correspondent paul brand mr hancock insisted it is safe for new people to move into care homes even those care homes where there are cases have very strong infection control procedures in place in fact if you look at the proportion of people in the uk who have sadly died in care homes it is significantly lower than in comparable countries across europe he claimed its clear that the epidemic in care homes is coming under control pointing to coronavirus mitigating measures such as the implementation of lockdown he insisted to mps that the the reproduction rate r value of coronavirus in the uk r value was below one in every region of the uk after reports that the number was above that in both the north west and south west he said in order to keep the r value down people must remain two metres apart from others despite suggestions that the safe distance could be reduced to one metre he defended the two metre rule as being based on science and said businesses may have to rely on their ingenuity to operate within the restriction the hospitality industry has warned that pubs and restaurants may be unable to reopen if the distance is not reduced we keep the two metre rule under review all the time and sage have been doing some work on this recently mr hancock told the downing street press conference but ultimately it is nt the rule that s the challenge to the opening of hospitality in a safe way its the virus he said the current working plan was for secondary schools to fully reopen in england from september at the earliest despite concerns about the two metre rule making that difficult for both schools and the economy it was a matter of working out how to open in a way that does not lead to an increased spread of the virus that is going to require ingenuity you can already see the ingenuity in lots of areas of the economy bars that have turned themselves into takeaways all sorts of different ways that people are providing services and making their business work in a way that is consistent with social distancing he said we ve got to be innovative we ve got to be thoughtful about this he cited an ever decreasing daily death figure which today at 55 was the lowest since lockdown began as one of the encouraging trends which show the virus is in retreat across the land the figures come as scotland reports no new coronavirus deaths in the last 24 hours for the second day in a row the health secretary said there have also been no deaths recorded in any london hospital in the past 24 hours he said the data is pointing in the right direction and it shows the uk is winning the battle with this disease mr hancock earlier told mps in the commons that black lives matter protests risk increasing the spread of coronavirus and said it was a mistake for anyone to attend watch the government coronavirus press conference in full video report by itv news political correspondent carl dinnen police have arrested at total of 135 people involved in around 200 black lives matter protests which took place in the uk over the weekend the home secretary has said priti patel making a statement in the house of commons said more than 137,500 people attended the mostly peaceful protests but a lawless minority of protesters turned to violence the thugs and criminals responsible are already being brought to justice she told mps after earlier tweeting that justice will follow at least 35 police officers were injured during protests in the capital she said downing street earlier condemned the toppling of slave trader edward colston 's statue in bristol as a criminal act after the city 's mayor said he felt no sense of loss over the monument 's disposal after being toppled the statue was rolled to the harbour and pushed in to the river avon boris johnson 's spokesperson said the prime minister 's view is that there is democratic process which should be followed when there is strong opinion about an issue lawyer defends policeman who held george floyd 's feet down houston to hold six hour public viewing of george floyds coffin mitt romney becomes first republican senator to join protests avon and somerset police said they had launched an investigation and were seeking to identify those involved with the removal of the statue home secretary patel has been having daily calls with police leaders including talks over the weekend and on monday morning with the metropolitan police and avon and somerset police downing street said both have the government 's full support in tackling any violence vandalism and disorderly behaviour she told mps any large gatherings of people are currently unlawful before adding we can not afford to forget were still in the grip of an unprecedented national health emergency that has tragically claimed more than 40,000 lives so the severe public health risk forces me to continue to urge the public not to attend future protests she said the prime minister absolutely understands the strength of feeling his spokesperson said but added in this country we settle our differences democratically and if people wanted the removal of the statue there are democratic routes which can be followed bristol mayor marvin rees the uk 's first directly elected black mayor said the statue in the middle of bristol was a personal affront to him as he was growing up in the city but said he can not condone the damage he told itv news he comes from a family of jamaicans who were at some point enslaved and i ca n't say that that statue is anything but offensive to me i 'm not condoning but you do need to understand and there 's a subtle but significant difference between understanding and condoning and that 's something that national government would do well to take on board asked whether he wanted to see those involved with removing the statue charged mr rees added that is up to the criminal justice system i do nt really intervene in criminal matters like that that s not for me to go and be a cheerleader to the police in any criminal investigations downing street said people can campaign for statues to be removed but what happened yesterday was a criminal act and when the criminal law is broken that is unacceptable and the police will want to hold to account those responsible despite acknowledging that discrimination and racism does exist in britain the prime minister does not agree that this is a racist country the spokesperson added itv news political reporter shehab khan on the protest aftermath labour leader sir keir starmer said the statue should have been taken down a long long time ago speaking on lbc sir keir said it was completely wrong for the statue to be pulled down in that way but he added you ca nt in 21st century britain have a slaver on a statue a statue is there to honour people mr rees warned that it would take more than the removal of a controversial statue to tackle racism that was stitched into the system he praised avon and somerset polices handling of the protest i think our police were incredible actually and this is intelligent nuanced policing not trumpian militarisation domination mr rees told bbc breakfast what we had was a police force with a huge crowd in front of it with lots of energy lots of passion lots of frustration and we did nt have the violent confrontations we had in other cities policing minister kit malthouse flatly described the toppling of the statue as a crime and warned prosecutions may follow it was a crime to pull that statue down because they committed criminal damage and that s not how we settle our differences in this country he told itv news that statue was controversial and offensive to many and its been a matter of debate in that city for many decades and that debate should have been settled through democratic means with the mayor the council taking a decision on what to do toppling slave trader statue utterly disgraceful home secretary says thousands take to the streets for anti - racism protests across the uk in pictures anti - racism protesters take to streets across the uk the way to settle it was not to tear it down and throw it into the dock that was a crime i m afraid and the police will be investigating it and prosecutions may well follow he added that the law of the land applies to me to you and to everybody that was on that demonstration health secretary matt hancock said the protests risk increasing the spread of coronavirus in the uk and it is a mistake for people to participate in demonstrations that help to spread this vile disease home secretary priti patel in the commons said we strongly support the right to protest peacefully but that does not extend to the violent behaviour we have witnessed earlier she called the toppling of the memorial utterly disgraceful i think that is utterly disgraceful and that speaks to the acts of public disorder that actually have now become a distraction from the cause in which people are actually protesting about and trying to empathise and sympathise she said labour 's sir keir said violence aimed at police by some protesters was completely unacceptable meanwhile prime minister boris johnson said the anti - racism demonstrations had been subverted by thuggery following clashes between pockets of protesters and police mr johnson tweeted that people have a right to protest but turning to violence was a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve asked what she made of those comments shadow chancellor anneliese dodds told itv news i wo nt condone any violence and vandalism protests must be done safely and peacefully but i think its really important that leaders right now recognise that they ve got a responsibility to try and heal divisions to try and unite communities we ve seen those protests which have been overwhelmingly peaceful occur because people are hurting they are hurting deeply and we have nt seen that reflected from the uks leader he has nt commented on the appalling death of george floyd we have nt seen any action since that public health report that showed black people are at least twice as likely to die from this disease the black lives matter rallies attracted thousands of people right across the uk and were largely peaceful but protests in london resulted in 36 people being arrested and eight officers injured during sundays anti - racism demonstrations metropolitan police said with offences including violent disorder criminal damage and assaulting police most of the arrests were related to public order offences while one was for criminal damage following an incident at the cenotaph it comes after scotland yard said 29 people were arrested and 14 officers were injured during clashes between police and protesters the day before health secretary matt hancock has defended the lack of black mps in the cabinet insisting it is one of the most diverse in british history speaking to itv news mr hancock pointed to chancellor rishi sunak and home secretary priti patel as being from ethnic minority backgrounds pressed on there being no black members in the current line up mr hancock said there were until a couple of months ago the most important thing is that we have that diversity throughout the government and the key thing is taking action to ensure that people have equality of opportunity he argued in the current cabinet of 22 there are no black or lgbt members and only six women the health secretary 's comments came as he urged people not to join mass anti - racism protests taking place across the uk on sunday due to the threat of coronavirus transmission in the crowds thousands of people are attending black lives matter blm rallies across the uk in the wake of the death of george floyd a black man who died in police custody in minneapolis worries that crucial r number could be as high as one in some areas mr hancock said he sympathised enormously with the cause but called on people to make the argument safely i think driving for true equality of opportunity across this country is incredibly importantly he told itv news i do want people to put that argument and i will support people who make that argument but the challenge is we are still living in the middle of a pandemic and we 're still trying to get the number of infections down but it 's a biological fact that gathering in large numbers without social distancing risks the increased spread of the virus and that risks lives i urge people to make the case and make the argument but follow the social distancing rules and follow the law because that 's the best way to make the case in a way that keeps people safe coronavirus health secretary warns against joining black lives matter protests mr hancock also defended the easing of lockdown restrictions despite the r number the rate of transmission of covid-19 rising in parts of england he went on to avoid answering a hypothetical question about how localities could be locked down if rates of the respiratory disease were rising but people had to travel to or from the area for work mr hancock said he could not answer whether someone who lived in an unaffected area but worked in a place that had been put on lockdown as it was not based on something that 's happening right now i 'm not going to get into hypothetical questions i 'm going to talk about what the policy is mr hancock said in the north west the r value which indicates how fast a disease spreads through a population is close one manchester mayor andy burnham has criticised the government saying it has loosened lockdown too early and linking it to the rise in the covid-19 r number in the region the health secretary said regional lockdowns would be imposed in areas or within hospitals and care homes where there was an outbreak but andy burnham and his liverpool counterpart steve rotheram said they had not been consulted and told itv news they do not know how the plans will work mr rotheram accused the government of not having the details he is asking for on local lockdowns calling them back of a fag packet plans the president of the channel tunnel operator getlink jacques gounon has written to boris johnson warning that the new scheme to quarantine travellers from abroad that starts on monday is fraught with problems in a letter sent on saturday mr gounon adds limited consultation by the home office and departmental intransigence have led to a situation that puts a serious risk on the efficiency of operations at the channel tunnel a vital link in the great british supply chain setting out the difficulties faced by the channel tunnel operator with half its staff either working part time or on furlough he says the home office is insisting that each member of our active team spends hours every day filling in 27 screens for each of up to eight daily crossings for the channel he adds emergency crews will also have to stop and complete the form on their way to an incident none of this should be necessary mr gounon says and has not been required in the last couple of months because under the terms of the treaty creating the channel tunnel in 1986 staff operate between the border neither in one country nor in the other he says we hold the data about them and their shuttle missions that is required by the home office they could supply it from the corporate centre but the home office wo n't accept the data unless it is provided by the individuals every time they cross in essence the home office needs data we have that data and are happy to share it but the department is fixated on that data coming from a different source and so refuses our solution he accuses the home office of having a resistance to simplicity that renders our proposals fruitless mr gounon pleads with boris johnson for his intervention urgently to help find a solution to an eminently solvable problem the getlink president also complains that in respect of the entire travel quarantine policy the form that passengers have to fill in and communications materials were only available late yesterday friday and yet an entire industry workers and passengers must prepare for introduction on monday getlink joins a chorus of criticism from the travel industry of the policy ryanair chief executive michael o'leary described it in an interview on my wednesday night itv show as ineffective and useless and the government is being sued over it by british airways more from robert peston what is the government doing to protect us from second wave and second lockdown what is the price of two metre social distancing why the cummings crisis is now all about how johnson governs what comes next now that the transmission rate and prevalence of covid-19 have fallen significantly before you shout at me yes i know there is frustration and some bemusement among scientists that illness incidence and numbers of deaths have not dropped faster in the uk but they have nonetheless reduced significantly if not uniformly everywhere there are detailed plans from the government for when and how to restart certain businesses and social activities in the coming six weeks but there is not a clearly articulated strategy for how we are expected to live and work between now and the end of the year and beyond so i 've tried to piece together what ministers and officials have said privately and publicly about different elements of the longer term strategy thousands attend black lives matter protests across uk despite warnings calling peston is boris johnson still following the science everything rests on a tripod 1 the growing optimism that a vaccine may be ready for mass use perhaps as soon as september 2 the hope that testing tracing and isolating the symptomatic and their contacts will continue to suppress the incidence of the ghastly virus 3 the associated hope that the new testing and tracing infrastructure will yield reliable data such that if there is a flare up of infections the response can be a highly localised lockdown perhaps locking down just one hospital at a time or a small residential community rather than a regional or national lockdown underlying all policy is the working assumption of the pm health secretary and their expert advisers that all other things being equal there will be a significant second wave probably from october onwards how so well as a nation we are a world away from that notorious herd immunity the proliferation within the vast majority of us of antibodies conferred by having suffered the bug or having been injected with vaccine or anti - body rich plasma and yes i am aware that scientists do n't even know for sure whether antibodies confer any kind of helpful immunity though it would be odd if they gave no protection so collectively we remain acutely vulnerable to infection however there seems to be a seasonal element to the rate of transmission though the significance of seasonality is disputed the important point is that as it gets colder we will as usual move in doors where it is easier to pick up the infection also the sun 's uv seems to be a useful disinfectant which is not to say a second winter spike will be as devastating as what we 've been living with because when there is another surge of infection enough of us may have semi - permanently altered our behaviour enough to keep the r the rate of transmission lower than it would otherwise be i can see this in my own actions i now instinctively socially distance and i have no problem wearing a mask when in a confined space confession i was always a neurotic hand washer like most of us i miss hugging family and friends but the price of hugs seems exorbitant even so however much we alter our social interaction at work and play it is probable that the virus will remain a real and present danger so let 's look at the detail of boris johnson 's planned prophylaxis first there is much more optimism around the possible availability of a vaccine as early as september than seemed remotely plausible only a few weeks ago the developers the researchers at oxford university and its commercial partner astrazeneca put the probability at much greater than 50 % that the vaccine is active in the words of one of those intimately involved in the project the uncertainties include what kind of protection the vaccine may give there is for example too little evidence on whether it would eradicate the virus from the body entirely or do the lesser job of reducing the severity of the illness so that hospitalisation is less of risk either sort of shield would of course be preferable to our current lack of any viral defence it is also unclear whether we would need one or two doses none of which is to say we wo n't all feel bitterly let down at the end of july which is when the oxford / azn vaccine team think they will know with more confidence whether they have a winner apart from anything else the more that lockdown and sunshine reduce the spread of the virus in europe the harder it is for the researchers to conduct robust trials on humans those trials need to take place where there is enough of the illness passing from person to person for meaningful comparisons to be made between the health outcomes of those who 've been vaccinated and the unvaccinated that is why azn and oxford are rapidly setting up a study in brazil where covid-19 is still raging what if the vaccine is a pharmacological lemon will it be back to full national lockdown when the frost bites that is not johnson 's and hancock 's plan or hope a second national lockdown could in theory be avoided if the bold new test trace and isolate infrastructure actually works and turns out by september to be the world class system that has been promised by its creator dido harding the logistical challenge of creating such an alert and extinguish system is not to be under estimated however apart from anything else speed and comprehensiveness of coverage are absolutely of the essence let 's examine just one part of the design namely the pm 's pledge from this week that all tests that are n't subject to the vagaries of the postal system should be completed in 24 hours there are plenty of epidemiologists who are anxious that is not adequate simply because on the basis of current performance more than a third of the relevant tests are subject to the postal system tests that are carried out at home or at mobile sites and therefore will take longer than 24 hours here is the potentially lethal maths of testing delays let 's say you acquire the symptoms and you immediately order the test to be done at home it may arrive the following day or maybe the day after then you swab yourself and send it back it could take another couple of days to reach the lab and then another day to be processed by technicians you would get the result perhaps six days after you acquired the symptoms perhaps even later than that during all that time you will have been isolating at home with your family so in theory you wo n't have been spreading the virus directly beyond those with whom you share your home but and this is what matters it is only after you receive a positive test that the government 's newly employed teams of virus tracers will attempt to contact all those people you were infecting in the days before you went into quarantine and if any of them were infected by you they will have been out and about in the community infecting others for several days this is why the former health secretary jeremy hunt has been loudly pressing the government to adopt taiwanese standards of testing turnaround times a day or less it is hard to challenge his logic that a potential lag of several days between someone needing a test and the start of contact tracing means the risk of infection within the community will remain far too high by the way it also seems eccentric that the rules allow those with symptoms to allow resumption of normal life if they receive a negative test since false negatives from the tests are in the 20 % to 30 % range far better as hunt said on my show the other night to at least require those with the classic symptoms to have a second test before they are allowed to leave home and re - enter the workplace which obviously include hospitals and care homes where and when should i wear face coverings thousands more may have died with covid-19 without being diagnosed data reveals uk coronavirus death toll tops 40,000 as further 357 fatalities announced equally there is an argument for mandatory weekly testing of everyone working in care settings hospitals and care homes given the high prevalence of the virus in those places that kind of mass testing is being promoted by tony blair and gordon brown and we are yet to have a proper debate about the paul romer argument that unlocking the economy can only safely be done when literally all of us are regularly tested all of which is to argue that the risk of a second viral surge does not bring a commensurate risk of a second national lockdown but it is to say that to avoid such a lockdown which would wreak utter havoc on our way of life and incomes a mind numbing amount of complex work on detecting the virus and vaccinating against it has to be completed successfully in record time even with the most competent leaders and officials in history and we probably lack those there is no guarantee enough will go right planned government regulations will soon require face coverings to be worn by all hospital outpatients and visitors as well as anyone travelling on public transport in england before the new rules come into effect on june 15 here is what you need to know about the use of masks and coverings what is a face covering face coverings are not the same as face masks the government has stated that coverings can be made from scarves bandanas or other fabric items so long as they cover the mouth and nose they should allow the wearer to breathe comfortably and be tied behind the head to provide a snug fit officials have said people can make their own coverings at home using t shirts or cotton fabric and string why are they being recommended the government states that while wearing a face covering does not protect the wearer it may protect others if people are infected but have not yet developed symptoms people wearing a covering should wash their hands before putting it on and after taking it off it should also be washed regularly in the laundry with detergent the government said face coverings compulsory on public transport in england from june 15 how will social distancing work as more children go back to school in england when should i wear a face covering according to new world health organisation who advice face coverings should be worn in public whenever social distancing is not possible especially if you are over 60-years old or have an underlying health condition however this is not yet compulsory are there any specific locations that require me to wear a face covering health secretary matt hancock announced on friday all hospital visitors and outpatients will be required to wear face coverings and all hospital staff will be required to wear surgical masks in england from june 15 face coverings will also be mandatory from the same date for anyone using public transport in england several airlines such as easyjet and ryanair have also introduced a requirement for passengers to wear face masks what about face masks people have been asked not to use medical grade personal protective equipment ppe masks to ensure these remain available for frontline health staff how will new quarantine measures affect travellers to uk coronavirus face masks could reduce spread of person 's breath by 90 % how will the public transport measures be enforced while announcing the measures transport secretary grant shapps told reporters that it will be enforced by transport operators and british transport police if necessary he said that changes would be made to the conditions of travel for trains and buses adding this will mean that you can be refused travel if you do nt comply and you could be fined meanwhile a department of health and social care spokeswoman said that although members of the public are strongly urged to attend hospital wearing a face covering no one will be denied care and masks will be provided by the hospital if necessary are there any exemptions there will be exemptions to the rules for very young children disabled people and those with breathing difficulties what if i m travelling on a train from wales or scotland to england mr shapps has suggested that passengers on trains starting outside england may have to put on coverings when crossing the border he said it would be up to scotland and wales to issue their own guidance but earlier on thursday scottish first minister nicola sturgeon tweeted that her government is considering making it mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport and in shops if i develop covid-19 symptoms can i still go out if i wear a mask or covering no people with coronavirus symptoms and their household should isolate at home what is the science the scientific advisory group for emergencies sage thinks the evidence of masks preventing the spread of infection from one person to another is marginal but positive the who has stressed that there is no evidence that wearing a mask whether medical or other types by healthy persons in the wider community can prevent them from infection with respiratory viruses including covid-19 are there any downsides to using face coverings concerns have been raised that they could give a false sense of security and mean that people are less stringent with other preventative measures such as social distancing and hand hygiene video report from itv news correspondent sejal karia at parliament square thousands of protesters have taken part in anti - racism demonstrations in several uk cities this weekend despite warnings from ministers that mass gatherings are banned worldwide protests over the killing of george floyd in minneapolis are heading into their second weekend

let their voice be heard they protested largely without incident our officers have been professional and very restrained but there was a smaller group intent on violence towards police officers she added twenty three officers have received injuries doing their job policing protest over the last few days and that is totally unacceptable there have been 14 arrests made today but we expect that number to rise and there will be a post -event investigation carried out home secretary priti patel said violence towards police at protests was completely unacceptable and gave officers her full support in tackling disorderly behaviour writing on twitter she said protests must be peaceful and in accordance with social distancing rules violence towards a police officer is completely unacceptable at any time the police have our full support in tackling any violence vandalism or disorderly behaviour there is no justification for it protesters vowed the demonstration would be peaceful after a previous protest earlier this week saw 13 people arrested amid physical clashes with police boxing heavyweight champion anthony joshua used crutches to join people on a peaceful

angeles protests were sparked after video footage showed mr floyd gasping that he can not breathe while being arrested by four officers in minneapolis before being pronounced dead they have since been charged over the death which sparked days of protest in the us and black lives matter blm demonstrations across the world joe biden has officially clinched the democratic partys presidential nomination setting him up to meet donald trump for the leadership of a country beset by the coronavirus pandemic and civil unrest mr biden said in a statement it was an honour to compete alongside one of the most talented groups of candidates the democratic party has ever fielded and i am proud to say that we are going into this general election a united party the former vice president has been his partys presumptive nominee since rival bernie sanders ended his campaign in april racism is deeply entrenched in our soil says bishop michael curry trump says it is a great day for george floyd as us unemployment falls the week that changed america voices from the frontline but he needed to secure a sufficient number of delegates from elections this week in seven states and the district of columbia with a surge in mail ballots making his position official late on friday the moment was met with little of the traditional fanfare as the nation confronts overlapping crises while biden has started to venture out more this week the coronavirus pandemic has largely confined him to his wilmington delaware home for much of the past three months the country currently faces the worst rate of unemployment since the great depression and civil unrest that harkens back to the 1960s has erupted in dozens of us cities and spread around the world following the death of george floyd mr floyd was a black man who died when a white minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air it is a confluence of events that no us leader has faced in modern times made all the more complicated by a president who has at times antagonised the protesters and is eager to take the fight to mr biden mr biden acknowledged on friday night that it was a difficult time in americas history america 's military has a new battlefield the country 's racial conflict comparison between trumps church visit and churchill verges on obscenity he added and donald trumps angry divisive politics is no answer the country is crying out for leadership leadership that can unite us leadership that can bring us together mr biden is in the midst of his third bid for the presidency having spent 36 years as a senator before becoming barack obamas deputy in 2008 his success in securing the nomination has been attributed to strong support from black voters whose backing he will need in critical swing states if he is to defeat mr trump in november the health secretary has warned people against joining black lives matter protests this weekend pointing out that were still facing a health crisis and coronavirus remains a real threat matt hancock told the government 's daily coronavirus press conference that people should remember the rules that they should not attend large gatherings including demonstrations of more than six people protests including several in the uk are due to take place this weekend as people share their outrage over the killing of george floyd in the us mr hancock admitted being appalled by the man 's death at the hands of a police officer but said it is vital that people stick to the rules this weekend is to protect themselves and their family from this horrific disease he also announced that hospital visitors and outpatients will need to wear face coverings in england from june 15 all hospital staff will be required to wear surgical masks in england from the same date he said he told the daily downing street press conference as the nhs reopens right across the country its critically important to stop the spread amongst staff patients and visitors too so today were setting out that all hospital visitors and outpatients will need to wear face coverings one of the things that we ve learnt is that those in hospital those who are working in hospital are more likely to catch coronavirus whether they work in a clinical setting or not and so to offer even greater protection were also providing new guidance for nhs staff in england which will come into force again on june 15 and all hospital staff will be required to wear type one or two surgical masks worries that crucial r number may be as high as 1 in some areas undiagnosed coronavirus ' likely explanation for excess deaths flawed test and trace wo n't be world class for months and this will cover all staff working in hospital it will apply at all times not just when they are doing life saving work on the frontline and it will apply in all areas except those areas designated as covid secure workplaces he 's speaking just hours after donating his covid-19 antibodies to a trial which aims to assess whether antibodies from survivors can be used to treat those currently battling the virus the health secretary is likely to face accusations from journalists that lockdown was relaxed too soon after the governments chief scientific adviser said the reproduction rate r number of coronavirus could be as high as one in some parts of england the overall uk r value remains unchanged since the easing of lockdown measures at between 0.7 and 0.9 sir patrick vallance told a virtual briefing with journalists on friday but the r used to measure how a disease spreads through a population for england by itself is 0.7 - 1 according to office for national statistics figures released on friday while the ons figures show community transmission continue to show a downward trend the overall r number is being dragged up by infection rates in hospitals and care homes sir patrick told journalists on friday there were roughly 39,000 new coronavirus cases each week watch friday 's press conference in full protesters lay on the street outside dominic cummings house in a die in on thursday evening in protest against the governments response to coronavirus wearing masks and holding signs around 20 campaigners joined the demonstration in north london two weeks since news broke of the downing street advisers relocation to durham and drive to barnard castle during the uk lockdown the protesters were outside mr cummings property for around 30 minutes and told the pa news agency they were all socially distanced they added the response from the street was largely positive with around 15 neighbours joining them and one leading a chant of black lives matter over 50,000 dead while you re playing king of the castle read one of the groups signs man makes 30 miles to barnard castle game to express cummings anger one protester sita bilani was unable to attend the funeral of her aunt who died with covid-19 in april due to social distancing measures and said its insulting to hear boris johnson say we should move on the lack of remorse not just for cummings disregard for the rules but for the thousands of preventable deaths is a disgrace the metropolitan police said they attended the protest and dispersed it after a short time adding that no arrests were made protesters said they are calling on the government to sack mr cummings and implement a strategy to tackling the pandemic based on world health organisation who recommendations they also called for public health england to publish its full findings of its review which this week found black asian and minority ethnic bame people are at significantly higher risk of dying from covid-19 the protesters said they intend to build on the action and make more demonstrations on the issue two weeks ago in a press conference about his trip to durham mr cummings said his home in london has been a target for harassment i did not make my movements public at the time because my london home was already a target mr cummings said i did not believe i was obliged to make my parents home and my sisters home a target for harassment as well mps on both sides of the political divide called for mr cummings resignation over the trip including scotland minister douglas ross who quit the government over the issue cressida dick says there is a distinction between police force in uk and us metropolitan police commissioner dame cressida dick has dismissed suggestions officers unfairly target black people amid accusations aimed at the force new figures show that officers enforcing coronavirus lockdown were more than twice as likely to issue fines to black people as opposed to white people according to analysis carried out for the guardian it comes as some protesters drew comparisons with police in the uk and the us and while thousands others took to the streets in solidarity over the death of george floyd a black man who was killed by minneapolis police in the us clashes with police after thousands join black lives matter rally in london agency nurse claims she lost work for speaking out about quality of ppe given to bame nhs staff ms dick said there was a distinction between the us and the uk in terms of its history its culture and policing models and that met police officers were not unfairly targeting black people she said we know that in london our black communities have suffered all sorts of disadvantages in terms of health in terms of education in terms of employment outcomes i completely refute a suggestion that this is because the officers are targeting young black men ' and our black communities are very heavily subject to being victims of violent crime we police in the areas where we can do the best effect at reducing violence and so we are policing and present in areas of high footfall and areas where that weather has been balanced now when one of my officers stop let 's say a hundred white people and then a hundred black people the outcome the positive outcome rate is exactly the same so i completely refute a suggestion that this is because the officers are targeting for example young black men we 're not we 're policing in areas where violence is high we 're trying to protect people we are highly accountable we 're highly scrutinised pockets of protesters clashed with police after thousands of people flooded into central london for a black lives matter demonstration on wednesday activists chanted black lives matter and we will not be silent in hyde park in a peaceful demonstration before tensions escalated later outside downing street the metropolitan police said 13 people were arrested during the protests which ran into the early hours of thursday morning business secretary alok sharma confirmed he tested negative for coronavirus after he appeared ill during a speech in the house of commons the 52-year old appeared ill while at the despatch box on wednesday with footage showing him wiping sweat off his brow as he delivered a statement to mps the senior tory went home early and there were fears dozens of mps including the prime minister would have to self isolate for 14 days if mr sharma tested positive for covid-19 following the roll out of the new track and trace system boris johnson could be forced to isolate after meeting minister now suspected of having coronavirus writing on his twitter mr sharma said huge thanks to everyone for their really kind messages over the last 24 hours and my grateful thanks also to the parliamentary authorities and speaker for their support yesterday just had results in and my test for # covid19 was negative business secretary sharma became ill just one day after the government scrapped virtual proceedings forcing mps to attend parliament in person if they wish to participate the prime minister 's spokesperson confirmed that even those who have had covid-19 must isolate and when pressed on whether the pm would self isolate for 14 days if told to he said i would expect us to take medical advice and to follow it the dispatch box was being wiped down between exchanges but the scheduled pause after the bills reading went on for longer than expected and journalists were unusually asked to leave the press gallery following sharma 's speech despatch box cleaned after sharma speech but number 10 says it will not review the return to physical only proceedings despite concerns that physical meetings could cause mr johnson and rishi sunak into isolation many mps had serious safety concerns about returning to parliament with many criticising the building 's set up as not fit for social distancing despite mr sharma falling ill brandon lewis insisted to itv news that parliament has reopened in a manner that follows the guidelines he claimed the new system which sees mps form a long winding queue through parliament in order to vote ensures proper good social distancing and protects people 's health and safety although that does mean we have to queue a little bit to vote i think it 's right that we do that and the least we can do is queue up for a little bit to ensure that we are properly governing the country that is actually in the long run hugely important for whole of the united kingdom he added but labour 's shadow foreign secretary said social distancing in the house of commons is impossible lisa nandy who lost the labour leadership election to keir starmer said mps are travelling home to every part of the country tonight reckless does nt even begin to describe it she said the new queuing system which has been set up to replace remote voting has been a complete shambles it sends exactly the wrong message to the public about social distancing video report by itv news science editor tom clarke the wearing of face coverings will be compulsory on public transport in england from june 15 the transport secretary has announced travellers could be fined or refused permission to board buses or trains if they refuse to comply with the order it follows weeks of deliberation following advice from sage which said there is limited evidence to suggest face coverings offer some albeit limited protection against the spread of the virus the evidence suggests face coverings do not protect the wearer but could reduce the likelihood the wearer will pass on infection a face covering helps protect out fellow passengers it 's something that we can each do to help each other grant shapps said uk coronavirus death toll increases by 176 to 39,904 pm may have to isolate after mp becomes ill with suspected virus staff who come into contact with passengers such as police and ticket inspectors will also need to wear face coverings the transport secretary said the government is working with unions transport operators and the police to ensure that they ve the supplies they need to be safe and to provide reassurance to the public mr shapps said people should not be wearing surgical masks which we must keep for clinical settings it means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home he added there will be exemptions to the rules for very young children for disabled people and those with breathing difficulties london mayor sadiq khan said he was pleased the government had finally seen sense on the issue of face coverings sharma tested for covid-19 after appearing ill in the commons mps vote to scrap hybrid voting and continue with absurd queues outside parliament this is something i and others have been calling on ministers to do for some time and is in line with a large body of evidence that they can help stop the spread of coronavirus he said mr shapps said the rule change is being made to coincide with easements to lockdown which will see some non - essential retail shops and secondary schools reopen on june 15 he said this along with the ramping up of services on buses trams and trains will keep us safe and reduce the risk of coronavirus particularly on public transport the transport secretary is speaking at the government 's daily coronavirus press conference alongside sir peter gerard hendy the chairman of network rail podcast the items in your home charity shops want the most how will social distancing work at schools in england mr shapps said guidelines such as social distancing and not using public transport during peak times should still be followed he said we need to ensure every precaution is taken on buses trains aircraft and on ferries mr shapps said he wants to use the recovery from the pandemic to ensure people travel by greener means mr shapps told the downing street briefing that there has been a 100 % increase in weekday cycling going up to 200 % at the weekend compared to pre - covid-19 we want to use this recovery to permanently change the way we travel he said the uk 's death toll now stands at 39,904 the transport secretary announced at the press conference an increase of 176 deaths since yesterday some 220,057 coronavirus tests were posted yesterday mr shapps said but it does not mean that number of tests were carried out it comes as boris johnson awaits the results of alok sharma 's coronavirus test which he took after becoming ill in the house of commons mr johnson who held a 45-minute meeting with the business secretary shortly before mr sharma fell ill would be forced to isolate for up to 14 days if the test result is positive despite having already had the virus himself mr sharma is doing fine his cabinet colleague grant shapps said the transport secretary said he had spoken to mr sharma within the past hour and the business secretary was working from home while he awaited the result of his coronavirus test earlier prime minister johnson opened a conference aimed at raising funds for the global coronavirus vaccination effort he told the gavi vaccine alliance meeting he hopes the it will be a moment when the world comes together uniting humanity in the fight against disease boris johnson could soon be forced into self isolation after holding a 45-minute meeting with a cabinet minister who became ill with suspected coronavirus shortly after the chancellor was also at the meeting and could also be forced to quarantine if alok sharma 's covid-19 test comes back positive the prime minister 's spokesperson confirmed that even those who have had covid-19 must isolate and when pressed on whether the pm would self isolate for 14 days if told to he said i would expect us to take medical advice and to follow it mps vote to scrap hybrid voting and

maintain social distancing while voting on the motion but secretary of state for northern ireland brandon lewis mp told itv news that parliament has reopened in a manner that follows the guidelines i think if you look at what 's happened in parliament the house authorities have done what we 're directing businesses across the country as they gradually reopen to do he said which is to do so in a

spread of the virus ryanair chief executive michael oleary has described the uks coronavirus response as shambolic and said plans to quarantine passengers upon arrival would be useless ryanair has announced plans to restore 40 per cent of its flights from july 1 subject to travel restrictions being lifted with the eu however the governments announcement on wednesday is expected to severely impact demand from foreign tourists wanting to come to the uk if they have to self isolate for 14 days upon arrival two metre rule halves chances of catching coronavirus compared to one metre study finds coronavirus easyjet to cut flights routes and up to 30 % of its staff speaking on the peston show mr oleary said regrettably robert it 's been one shambles after another of mismanagement making it up as they go along and the latest of which has been today 's frankly shambolic announcement of an ineffective and useless quarantine people now have to fill in a form which the uk government has n't even published yet mr oleary criticised the governments announcement of new quarantine measures saying the problem with this quarantine is it 's not a quarantine you know a quarantine is only effective if you kind of trap people or gather people at the point of entry here they 're asking people to fill in a nonexistent form on arrival at heathrow or gatwick then get on to london underground or the trains buses public transport stop off in tesco maybe go to halfords before you reach your quarantine address he said passengers arriving in the uk could easily mislead authorities by claiming they are self isolating when in reality they are out in society he added you give them your mobile phone number and in the unlikely event that anybody calls you over the next two weeks you can answer the phone from a beach from a golf course from your office from your local demonstration outside the houses of parliament and say yes i 'm quarantining away in perfect compliance mr oleary said his company were working on providing refunds to customers but the crisis had led to his company having to deal with an average of 10,000 refunds a month to 35 million during the last three months he said at the moment we 're about 40 per cent of the way through that backlog we 've about 60 per cent to go we expect now to eliminate all of those remaining refunds for the months of april may and june probably in the next eight to ten weeks he also said once flights resume all passengers will be required to wear a face mask on ryanair flights video report by itv news correspondent richard pallot boris johnson has defended the government 's decision to impose a two week quarantine for new entrants to the uk as a growing number of tory backbenchers voiced their objections to the restrictions earlier home secretary priti patel outlined time limited quarantine measures for people arriving in the uk from overseas from june 8 under the policy anyone who breaches the upcoming uk quarantine rules and fails to self isolate could be fined 1,000 or face potential prosecution arrivals will be required to fill in a contact locator form including details on where they will isolate and how they can be contacted speaking at the daily downing street coronavirus briefing the prime minister said the government would review the measures every three weeks and would explore the possibility of travel corridors with countries with low rates of coronavirus but the 14-day quarantine policy has come under fire from an increasing number of tory backbenchers including former prime minister theresa may. mr johnson 's predecessor joined a growing number of tory voices expressing concern for at the plans calling on ministers to ensure the country remains open for business coronavirus everything you need to know about air bridges starmer attacks johnson over diminished confidence in coronavirus response ba threatens to dismiss 19,000 staff unless they accept worse pay and conditions addressing the house during wednesday 's prime minister 's questions mrs may said the 14-day quarantine would close britain off and urged ministers to develop an international aviation health screening programme but mr johnson told the downing street briefing on wednesday evening that it was the right time to introduce the policy in order to minimise the risk of imported cases triggering a second peak he said once community transmission was widespread within the uk cases from abroad made up a tiny proportion of the total at the same time you will remember international travel plummeted as countries around the world went into lockdown as a result measures at the border were halted because they made little difference at the time in our fight against the virus now that were getting the virus under control in the uk there is a risk that cases from abroad begin once again to make up a greater proportion of overall cases we therefore need to take steps now to manage that risk of these imported cases triggering a second peak the plans have been criticised for coming too late while travel firms had urged the government to scarp the measures fearing a 14-day quarantine for arrivals into the uk would be disastrous for the industry mr johnson would not be drawn on whether britons would be able to go abroad on holiday this year but urged people to follow foreign office advice and avoid non - essential travel video report by itv news science correspondent tom clarke sir keir starmer attacked boris johnson over the dwindling confidence in the government 's handling of the coronavirus pandemic sir keir said mr johnsons use of statistics was damaging public trust in his government he said the problem when the prime minister uses statistics is that the statistics authority has had concerns on more than one occasion statistics watchdog criticises government 's inadequate data on coronavirus tests yesterday in a strongly worded letter to the health secretary the chair of the uk statistics authority said that the statistics still fall well short of expectations he went on to say it is not surprising given that their inadequacy data on testing are so widely criticised and so often mistrusted can the prime minister see how damaging this is to public trust and confidence in his government mr johnson replied i really do not see the purpose in his endless attacks on public trust and confidence sir keir also noted that the director of the reuters institute said they had never seen such a drop in trust in 10 years adding how worried is the prime minister about this loss of trust mr johnson replied i really do not see the purpose in his endless attacks on public trust and confidence political correspondent romilly weeks says that since sir keir starmer became labour leader pmqs has become more testing for boris johnson the labour leader wrote to mr johnson regarding the reopening of schools two weeks ago but claims he has not received a reply although the prime minister says the two have spoken on the phone sir keir said he has supported the governments gradual easing of restrictions adding that is why i wrote to the prime minister two weeks ago because i could see the problem with schools and i thought it needed leadership and consensus and i privately offered to do what i could to build that consensus that s the offer that was nt taken up labour has since put the letter into the public domain mr johnson also rejected the labour leaders claim that the governments test track and trace system is not yet fully operational sir keir said two weeks ago today at the despatch box the prime minister promised that we will have a test track and trace operation that will be world beating and yes it will be in place by june 1 but it is nt and a critical element the ability of local authorities to respond to local spikes is missing mr johnson replied i m afraid he s casting aspersions on the efforts of tens of thousands of people who have set up a test track and trace system in this country from a standing start we now have 40,000 people engaged in this mr johnson did not reveal what conversations he has had with us president donald trump over the death of george floyd and subsequent protests both sir keir starmer and snp leader in westminster ian blackford questioned mr johnson about the situation in america where people have taken to the streets to protest against racism and police brutality the prime minister said of course black lives matter and i totally understand the anger the grief that is felt not just in america but around the world and in our country as well i totally understand that and i get that and i also support as i ve said the right to protest the only point i would make to the house is that protests should be carried out lawfully and in this country protests should be carried out in accordance with our rules on social distancing the labour leader added that tuesdays scenes of mps queuing to vote in person in the commons and others not being unable to do so were shameful and pushed the prime minister to end the completely unnecessary and unacceptable process and instead allow remote voting to resume he told the commons if any other employer behaved like this it d be a clear and obvious case of indirect discrimination under the equalities act mr johnson replied i do think sir keir needs to consider what is really going on throughout the country where ordinary people are getting used to queuing for long periods of time to do their shopping or whatever it happens to be i do not think its unreasonable that we should ask parliamentarians to come back to this place and do their job for the people of this country i know its difficult and i apologise to colleagues for the inconvenience and i apologise to all those who have particular difficulties because they re shielded or elderly the change were making today will mean they should be able to vote by proxy mr johnson was pressed to publish a full health and economic risk assessment linked to covid-19 this government commissioned the review from public health england and we take its findings very seriously because there obviously are inequalities in the way the virus impacts on different people different communities in our country mr johnson told the commons he added that equalities minister kemi badenoch will be looking at what next practical steps we need to do to protect all our country from coronavirus the prime minister also said he hopes the global vaccine summit which begins on thursday will be the

winging it in its handling of the covid-19 pandemic and told boris johnson to get a grip the labour leader stepped up his criticism of mr johnsons record as he prepared to face him at prime ministers questions for the first time since news emerged of the controversial lockdown trip made by dominic cummings all eyes will be on the house of commons at midday to see how the prime minister performs opposite the labour leader with mr johnson likely to be grilled over his support for his senior adviser over his decision to take his family 260 miles away to durham in march to self isolate the leaders will come face to face on the day the uk coronavirus death toll could reach 50,000 having passed 49,800 on tuesday meanwhile new quarantine restrictions on travellers arriving in the uk will be set out by home secretary priti patel on wednesday including requiring the majority of visitors to britain to self isolate for 14 days sir keir said mr johnson has got to get a grip and expressed concerns that the government is now winging it in an interview with the guardian he said i am putting the prime minister on notice that he has got to get a grip and restore public confidence in the governments handling of the epidemic if we see a sharp rise in the r rate the infection rate or a swathe of local lockdowns responsibility for that falls squarely at the door of no 10 we all know the public have made huge sacrifices this mismanagement of the last few weeks is the responsibility of the government sir keir added my worry is that after a week or more of mismanagement i m deeply concerned the government has made a difficult situation 10 times worse there is a growing concern the government is now winging it at precisely the time when there should have been maximum trust in the government confidence has collapsed health minister edward argar says the current government would welcome working with sir keir if he came to them with a plan we 've seen sir keir starmer 's interview today in the papers and his comments mr argar told itv news the prime minister has been very clear if sir keir wants to come forward with proposals concrete proposals that he wants the government to look at we 're always happy to engage with him on that but he does at the moment seems to be a party leader without a proposal mps vote to scrap hybrid voting and continue with absurd queues it was also reported in the daily telegraph that mr johnson will now take charge of the response to the pandemic personally the prime minister in my experience as a health minister has been leading from the front throughout this pandemic mr argar said he has led this government it is a united government working to a clear plan and even when the pm was ill in hospitality we had that plan and we continued to work towards it statistics watchdog criticises inadequate data on coronavirus tests the quarantine rules set to be announced by ms patel include powers to refuse entry to foreign travellers who disobey uk authorities the plans which come into force on june 8 will see people arriving in the uk told to isolate for 14 days to prevent coronavirus cases being introduced from overseas a breach of self isolation in england would be punishable with a 1,000 fixed penalty notice or potential prosecution and unlimited fine while devolved administrations will set out their own enforcement action the home office said removal from the country would be considered as a last resort for foreign nationals who refuse to comply with the order to stay at a single residence the quarantine plan has been condemned by businesses in the travel sector and there have been calls from senior tories for the plan to be scrapped in favour of the so called air bridge solution mr argar explains the quarantine measures foreign travellers who disobey uk quarantine rules could face deportation and portugals foreign minister said his country is in discussions with the uk about air bridges so tourists can avoid being quarantined augusto santos silva said quarantine is an enemy of tourism adding during these weeks our diplomats will work together in order to guarantee that british tourists coming to portugal would not be subjected on their return to england to any kind of quarantine the prime ministers official spokesman confirmed on tuesday that the government is still looking at the prospect of air bridges between the uk and other countries creating specific exemptions from the quarantine rules writing in the daily telegraph ms patel said we will all suffer if we get this wrong and that is why it is crucial that we introduce these measures now lets not throw away our progress in tackling this deadly virus we owe it to the thousands who have died meanwhile a yougov poll of 1,565 people found that 63 % were in favour of the quarantine plan for travellers arriving in the uk video report by itv news correspondent libby wiener itv news has heard the

not to throw away our progress these measures are informed by science backed by the public and will keep us all safe the government has vowed to review the measures which will be in place across the uk but set individually by the devolved administrations by june 29 ministers have said they will study the impact the restraints are having on the economy as well the role antibody testing could have on lowering the health risk involved when considering whether to alter the arrangements transport secretary grant shapps said these measures will be reviewed every few weeks and we are working with the transport industry to see how we can introduce agreements with other countries when safe to do so so we can go abroad and tourists can come here downing street suggested on tuesday that the

the government is still looking at the prospect of air bridges between the uk and other countries creating specific exemptions from the quarantine rules reports suggest boris johnson is in favour of

today programme that air bridges would be a sensible targeted response between low risk countries i think the idea of air bridges are the right way forward he added i think as we ve seen across the world people are taking measures out of the lockdown and this targeted approach would be a much more sensible way to behave george morgan grenville chief executive of tour operator red savannah said

west of england correspondent rupert evelyn itv news can reveal 65,000 care workers in wales will have to pay tax and national insurance contributions on a 500 payment given to them for their coronavirus pandemic response the bonus gift from the labour led welsh government is not exempt from tax because it is made in connection with employment and would require a change in the law to make it so itv news reveals first care home closing due to coronavirus coronavirus death toll airbrushing out older people dying in care system it now seems likely the welsh government will have to gross up the payment themselves costing millions more than the 32 m they budgeted for to ensure care workers still receive every pound of the 500 they were promised it is likely the bonus payment will impact benefit entitlements as it will be classed as income and will have to be declared to the department for work and pensions a treasury spokesperson told itv news payments made in connection with employment are chargeable to income tax and nics unless explicitly exempt the welsh government has the powers and funding to gross up the payment if its intention is for social care workers to benefit by at least 500 they added the welsh government were aware the payment was taxable when they made the announcement at the start of may. at the time the first minister said we are urging the uk government and the hmrc to make an exception in these truly exceptional circumstances both sides have said they were working together but with no solution the uk government has asked the welsh government how it would like to proceed a treasury spokesperson said we value the contribution of social care workers particularly during the current crisis we also understand that the collective response to covid-19 needs to be uk wide which is why alongside our uk wide support schemes we 've provided over 2.2bn of funding for the welsh government to support people businesses and public services we are working with the welsh government to determine the exact scope of the proposed bonus payments made in connection with employment are however chargeable to income tax and nics unless explicitly exempt the welsh government has the powers and funding to gross up the payment if its intention is for social care workers to benefit by at least 500 a welsh government spokesperson said we are very disappointed that the uk government wants to tax the one off thank you payment we are going to make to carers we had hoped they would step up to the plate as we have done by prioritising these payments amongst all the very significant extra demands covid-19 has made on us we will continue to pursue this with them a spokesperson for the welsh conservatives said welsh government should have checked to see if 500 care worker bonus was subject to tax speaking after it was revealed that the 500 bonus for care workers in wales is subject to tax and ni deductions janet finch saunders the shadow social care minister said this is an expensive mistake by the welsh labour government and one likely to dishearten some of the most dedicated and tireless people working in wales welsh ministers clearly rushed the announcement out because they were having a bad news day for failing to test care home staff and residents the welsh government and its health minister really should have checked the tax status of these payments before making such a quick announcement because the decision to tax these payments was made by hmrc not the uk government the welsh government still has hundreds of millions in unallocated funds provided to wales as a result of the uk governments response to the pandemic it should use these to cover the cost of any deductions from care workers pay packets as a result of this foul up plaid cymru 's delyth jewell ms said this will be a blow to those carers who had been anticipating this bonus and might not now get the full 500 that is due them both the westminster and welsh government need to sort this out between them and put our carers first to ensure the carers get the 500 bonus payment they expected to receive in full with assurances that it will not impact any benefit entitlement of claimants however the truth is that this bonus was never going to be enough this crisis has truly exposed the year on year impact of cruel cuts and the way in which social care is seen as a second class service plaid cymru believes all care staff should have parity of pay and terms and conditions with nhs staff and that we should move social care

the major risk minorities groups face from coronavirus after a review showed black asian and ethnic minority bame people are up to twice as likely to die from covid-19 matt hancock leading the government 's daily coronavirus press conference said he was absolutely determined to fix the problem acknowledging race issues which are currently engulfing america he said the review by public health england was a particularly timely publication because right across the world people are angry about racial injustice i get that he added black lives matter he said equalities minister kemi badenoch was working on a response which he hopes will get to the bottom of why bame people are at higher risk and to find ways of closing that gap the government has been criticised for not ordering any recommendations following the publishing of the review the runnymede trust a race equality thinktank told itv news the lack of recommendations was disappointing and wholly inadequate this report does nt have a single recommendation and does nt have a single plan of action as to how it can prevent deaths and save lives and in the context of this pandemic its not only alarming its traumatic and suggests that bame lives are not worth saving virus thrives on inequalities and being bame is major risk factor bame group leaders have also expressed upset and confusion at the review describing it to itv news producer roohi hasan as a lost opportunity for addressing the unfairness & disproportionality she was told by bapio a bame medical group in uk representing indian doctors said the review was launched under a lot of fanfare we had a lot of hopes that finally this disparity will be addressed however the toothless report has turned out to be a damp squib a lost opportunity for addressing the unfairness and disproportionality of bame deaths another nail in the coffin for equality and transparency the review showed people of bangladeshi ethnicity are around twice as likely to die of coronavirus compared to people of white british ethnicity people of chinese indian pakistani other asian caribbean and other black ethnicity are between 10 % and 50 % more likely to die when compared with white people the health secretary updating mps on the review 's findings in the commons earlier said it is very clear that some people are significantly more vulnerable than others black men for example are at least three times more likely to catch covid-19 than white men are he said the government would act on the review rather than wait for a further one on the impact of coronavirus on bame communities he admitted there is much more work to do to understand what 's driving these disparities and said the link between ethnicity and the occupations that people do is an important part of this conundrum putting in place risk assessments for people who are in high risk occupations has been something that we ve already been doing the work on he said but work was needed to discover what factors there were over and above the impact of being in frontline jobs and living in urban areas its the wider co - determinants that we need to get to the bottom of and that s the work that along with phe kemi badenoch will be leading in the next stage to make sure we we look as broadly as possible mr hancock said he understood the yearning for a response and we will put action in place as soon as we can we wo nt wait for a report i ve got to talk to kemi about a timeline for it but i totally understand the urgency the importance and the sensitivity of getting this right us on the brink as trump threatens to call in the military mps face 1 km voting queues as they return to commons at the press conference he thanked bame nhs and social care workers and i want to say it right across society too i want to thank you and i want you to know that our whole country cares about your wellbeing and i value those who come to our country to work in the nhs and in social care and i love that this country is one of the most welcoming and tolerant and diverse mps have voted to scrap digital voting restricting them only to vote in person in the house of commons parliament had allowed mps to vote online during the coronavirus outbreak but mps voted in favour of the governments motion to only allow them to vote in person passing by 261 votes to 163 a majority of 98 mps also defeated an amendment to the motion which would have restored remote voting in the house of commons during the covid-19 pandemic the motion was defeated by 185 votes to 242 majority 57 65,000 care workers in wales will have to pay tax on their coronavirus response bonus black lives matter matt hancock acknowledges risk to bame groups and promises swift response this now means mps will have to queue to vote in the house of commons with hundreds of parliamentirains formed a long winding queue from the grass outside westminster hall to the despatch box in the commons as they tried to adhere to social distancing measures upon arrival mps many looking confused had to pause to state their name and voting intention some mps have been highly critical of the new change saying the return to the traditional way of voting puts mps at risk labours viendra sharma tweeted that he had been disenfranchised by the new parliamentary voting system as the medical advise was for him to remain at home he said its fundamentally discrimination against older mps the disabled and those who live with the vulnerable this government risked lives starting lockdown late against the advice of the first countries hit by corona and now they are hell bent on reopening parliament and schools the hybrid system had allowed up to 50 mps to attend the chamber in person and 120 others can contribute to proceedings from afar via zoom the system not only allows for social distancing to be observed but it means mps who are shielding people considered clinically vulnerable to covid-19 can participate in proceedings without causing risk to their health commons leader jacob rees mogg had insisted the hybrid system should be scrapped because he claimed it diminished the ability for mps to scrutinise legislations the new system was widely criticised by mps from across the house with labour mp charlotte nichols saying it was going spectacularly badly others including liberal democrat layla moran and labour 's luke pollard said the system was ridiculous dozens of mps posted pictures to twitter showing the absurd system tory mp michael fabricant remarked anyone watching the voting live on television would see what an embarrassing shambles it is rees mogg 's plans for a return to physical only proceedings were met with an outpouring of anger from mps across the house who claimed it favours those in good health the regular system of voting division lobbies was ruled out due to how close mps must be to one another meaning a bizarre system had to be employed speaker sir lindsay hoyle said the queuing system for votes would continue if mps supported the motion as it is the only method that is compatible with government set requirements and those from public health england labour mp margaret hodge 75 described the move as damaging and said it will limit accountability and create a toothless parliament she added as somebody in the vulnerable category i am unable to join them i am furious that for the first time in my 25 years as an mp i am being denied the right to vote the government wants 650 mps to stand in a giant queue to vote on how the commons makes decisions from now on she wrote on twitter former shadow leader of the house chris bryant said the queues would be like alton towers during the vote speaker sir lindsay hoyle encouraged mps to keep up to try to decrease the length of the queue snaking out of the commons chamber across the parliamentary estate he could be heard telling mps in the commons chamber why are we not keeping up there are other members waiting several mps including liberal democrat wera hobhouse bath and labours zarah sultana coventry south wore face coverings as they made their votes health secretary matt hancock has been rebuked by the uks statistics watchdog over coronavirus testing figures which are still far from complete and comprehensible uk statistics authority chairman sir david norgrove said it is not surprising that given their inadequacy data on testing are so widely criticised and often mistrusted he criticised the way the figures are presented at the daily downing street briefings with the headline total including both tests carried out and those which have been posted to recipients but not yet conducted the government has hit targets aimed at carrying out 100,000 tests a day by the end of april and having the capacity for 200,000 tests of various kinds by the end of may. as lockdown eases what will you be able to do and where what is the new guidance for people who are shielding what could cause a second coronavirus wave but sir david said the testing statistics still fall well short of its expectations it is not surprising that given their inadequacy data on testing are so widely criticised and often mistrusted he told mr hancock statistics on testing perhaps serve two main purposes the first is to help us understand the epidemic alongside the ons survey showing us how many people are infected or not and their relevant characteristics the second purpose is to help manage the test programme to ensure there are enough tests that they are carried out or sent where they are needed and that they are being used as effectively as possible the data should tell the public how effectively the testing programme is being managed virus related deaths at lowest level since end of march hundreds of travel and hospitality firms demand u - turn on quarantine plans eu open to two year brexit extension says michel barnier the way the data are analysed and presented currently gives them limited value for the first purpose the aim seems to be to show the largest possible number of tests even at the expense of understanding it is also hard to believe the statistics work to support the testing programme itself the statistics and analysis serve neither purpose well issues raised by sir david include lack of data on how many of the tests posted out are in fact then successfully completed lack of information at the daily press conference of the date when tests were carried out figures giving an artificially low impression of the proportion of tests returning a positive diagnosis because they only include diagnostic tests and not surveillance ones he called for test results to include information on what kind of employment people were in for example care home or medical staff their age gender and location to avoid repeating the problems with testing figures sir david called for key metrics for the nhs test and trace programme to be developed systematically the statistics will need to be capable of being related to the wider testing data and readily understood by the public through for example population adjusted maps of hotspots he suggested sir david said that good evidence trusted by the public is essential to success in containing the virus mps intending to vote in the commons on tuesday will be made to form huge winding queues through parliament after the government dropped virtual proceedings forcing members to attend in person if they wish to participate the government scrapped a hybrid system in place since the end of april -which enabled parliamentarians to either attend the commons in person or contribute to proceedings from afar via zoom the system allowed those who are shielding people considered clinically vulnerable to covid-19 to participate in proceedings without causing risk to their health but commons leader jacob rees mogg has insisted mps must return to physical only proceedings claiming the ability to scrutinise had been diminished by the hybrid system the move has been followed by an outpouring of anger from mps across the house who say their democratic rights are being snipped away as lockdown eases what will you be able to do and where what is the new guidance for people who are shielding what could cause a second coronavirus wave senior tory mp robert halfon who has cerebral palsy said the plan would turn shielding mps into parliamentary eunuchs labour mp margaret hodge 75 described the move as damaging and said it will limit accountability & create a toothless parliament she added as somebody in the vulnerable category i am unable to join them i am furious that for the first time in my 25 years as an mp i am being denied the right to vote the govt wants 650 mps to stand in a giant queue to vote on how the commons makes decisions from now on she wrote on twitter former shadow leader of the house chris bryant said the queues would be like alton towers liberal democrat mp jamie stone who is a carer for his wife said the move was forcing him to choose between his family and participating in votes you re asking me to choose between the health of my family and abiding by your poxy stubbornness i choose to fulfill my duties as a husband and family man he wrote on twitter mr rees mogg has tabled a motion preventing the resumption of virtual voting that allowed mps to have their say from afar during the pandemic virus related deaths at lowest level since end of march hundreds of travel and hospitality firms demand u - turn on quarantine plans eu open to two year brexit extension says michel barnier if the house approves the plan on tuesday mps may have to form kilometre long queues in order to obey social distancing rules when voting despite the lords planning a move online mr rees mogg argued that democracy would once again flourish having been curtailed under the hybrid halfway house which allowed mps to take part in debates and vote remotely while up to 50 were in the chamber and he insisted that the government is working to establish how shielding mps could continue to take part but the proposal has faced fierce criticism with the electoral reform society warning it poses a real threat for democratic representation and political equality if extremely vulnerable mps are unable to vote labour and opposition parties have tabled an amendment to the motion seeking to retain remote voting shadow leader of the commons valerie vaz warned mr rees moggs discriminatory proposals would result in two classes of mps those who can physically attend and those unable to owing to the governments own rules including having an underlying health condition or shielding responsibilities the abolition of the hybrid remote parliament which allowed all mps to take part regardless of their personal circumstances is discriminatory and would not be acceptable in any other workplace we remain ready to work with the government and all parties to reach a consensus that would allow all mps to participate on an equal basis commons speaker sir lindsay hoyle has said that if mps need to vote on tuesday they will do so by filing past the left side of the despatch box table to vote aye and to the right side to vote no they will pause at the despatch box to state their name and voting intention votes on subsequent days will be carried out under the arrangements agreed by mps on tuesday sir lindsay said it was clear that the house can not conduct divisions safely via the usual voting lobbies as it would be difficult to maintain social distancing mps will be asked to only attend the chamber when they are listed to be called to speak during a particular proceeding in a statement sir lindsay said while we will return to fully physical proceedings in the house tomorrow they will not be the same as before ideally i would have liked the government and opposition to have reached agreement on how we should conduct our proceedings and voting procedures unfortunately this has not been forthcoming as remote voting has lapsed and public health england have deemed our division lobbies unsafe i have had to devise a temporary way forward to break the deadlock because the house must be able to have its say it is not perfect it will take time and members will need to be patient but it is the safest method i can think of to enable members and supporting staff to maintain social distancing however i still remain hopeful that colleagues will agree on a method of participation that enables all members to take part especially those who are shielding vulnerable or have caring responsibilities a national blanket lockdown could be reimposed in the uk the health secretary has warned on the day several restrictions were lifted in england matt hancock said the government 's aim was to move forward in the battle with coronavirus by introducing local lockdowns for regional flare ups but said a blanket lockdown could be reimposed if that is necessary the health secretary claimed the government was getting this virus under control but warned the disease is not done yet as he urged people to continue with social distancing we are attempting to move the system from these national blanket measures to a more targeted approach this is why test and trace is such an important part of that but we have always said that we are prepared to reintroduce measures whether that is nationally or in response to a localised outbreak if that is necessary it 's absolutely safe says enjoy new freedoms in england how will back to school ' work with social distancing in england he said a joint biosecurity centre would have a big role in helping to decide on local lockdowns but admitted the body is not yet up and running the centre tasked with assessing the covid-19 alert level is being formulated at the moment he said an example of a local lockdown could be shutting to new admissions a hospital a&e if there was an outbreak in that hospital he said local directors of public health would work with regional public health england and nhs teams to make sure we got the response right the joint biosecurity centre would have a national role to provide the advice and the information that would then be acted on locally he said the decision to relax lockdown on monday had been made very carefully and we must nt throw away the progress that has been made we ve come so far together we can take these steps together but do not step too far he said mr hancock said the test and trace system launched last thursday had traced the vast majority of new infections and their contacts and insisted it was up and running however itv news spoke to a contact tracer who said no one she spoke to have been in touch with anyone we have apparently 8,000 new cases but where are they she said we 're not talking to them there are about 3,000 of me but nobody i have spoken to has had any one to talk to at the suggestion there were more tracers than new infections mr hancock said to err on the side of having too many contact tracers is the right side to err on testing tsar john newton said the numbers of tests feeding through and contacts being identified are high so we are very pleased with the level of completeness its operating pretty much as we had hoped of course of the numbers of new cases not all of them need to go into the contact tracing process so if its a case in a care home of somebody who is already part of a known outbreak or if the case is already known to the public health service then they do nt need to be contact traced in pictures welcome to the new normal travel and hospitality firms want u - turn on quarantine plans he said the numbers of contacts were less than modellers had forecast but were quite similar to the trials on the isle of wight in lockdown of course people do not have that many close contacts outside their household he said the total number of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the uk has risen to 39,045 mr hancock confirmed at the press conference the figure was up by 556 from the 38,489 deaths announced on sunday but mr hancock said the figures had increased by only 111 watch matt hancock 's press conference in full more than 200 travel and hospitality businesses have joined a campaign demanding a u - turn on planned 14-day quarantines for arrivals into the uk a policy one signatory has labelled deeply worrying the group of major hotels travel companies and restaurateurs claim the plan is unworkable and have endorsed a letter sent to home secretary priti patel the firms accuse the government of being woefully slow in protecting the industry from covid-19 financial impacts and they say the plans will deter foreign tourists from visiting the uk they are calling for air bridges to be created which enable people to travel without being quarantined between countries where the risk of being infected by coronavirus is deemed to be low current plans would mean all international arrivals apart from people carrying out a limited number of specified roles would need to self isolate for 14 days from june 8 despite the letter the government is pressing ahead with the quarantine plans the prime minister 's spokesman said however air bridges are being considered chancellor rishi sunak said the quarantine policy will be regularly reviewed on a three week basis overseas arrivals could face 1,000 fines if they fail to quarantine for 14 days cyprus to cover costs for tourists infected with covid-19 while on the island the letter says a mandatory quarantine imposed on all arriving passengers is the very last thing the travel industry needs not only will it reduce arrivals into the uk the letter says but it will deter uk visitors from travelling abroad and most likely cause other countries to impose reciprocal quarantine requirements on british visitors as france has already announced george morgan grenville chief executive of tour operator red savannah who is leading the campaign by travel and hospitality firms opposed to the measures said this is not just a group of company bosses complaining but employees from bottom to top calling for the quarantine plans to be quashed the extent of their pain is deeply worrying for our economy and our country seventy five businesses signed the letter to ms patel last week but it has now been endorsed by more than 200 as concern about the impact of the quarantine grows coronavirus easyjet to cut flights routes and up to 30 % of its staff firms which support the campaign include london hotels the ritz and the dorchester travel firms kuoni and inghams and chef jason atherton meanwhile the telegraph reported that more than 20 tory mps are also demanding that the government changes its quarantine plan transport select committee chairman huw merriman called for the blanket rule to be ditched in favour of other measures such as air bridges compulsory ppe and temperature testing at airports former environment secretary theresa villiers also gave her backing for the scheme to be altered telling bbc radio 4s westminster hour i would very much prefer the quarantine rules be targeted on flights from covid hotspots i think we really do need to find ways to ease travel between this country and other countries like italy and spain and france where not only are there important business connections but people do desperately want to be able to take their summer holiday video report by itv news science editor tom clarke the chancellor has assured the public it is absolutely safe to enjoy new freedoms provided by the government 's easing of lockdown restrictions in england as some restrictions were relaxed on monday to allow outdoor meetings of up to six people as well as the reopening of outdoor retail and primary schools a number of scientists and public health leaders said lockdown is being eased too fast but rishi sunak visiting an outdoor market in london said it 's safe and people should have the confidence to go out there and get their life a little bit back to normal he said great progress had been made in previous weeks which meant a really important first step could be made to allow outdoor retail to reopen i 'm here grabbing my lunch people are here doing the same traders are all back i hope in the coming days and weeks many more people will do the same and slowly we 're going to get our lives back to normal he added easing lockdown is taking a bit of a risk warns top scientific adviser to government tensions continue over lockdown easing as pupils begin returning to school however number of top scientists who sit on sage the committee advising the government about the coronavirus pandemic and the association of directors of public health adph are warning the move to relax lockdown has been made too soon the adph said it was increasingly concerned about the new rules coming into force saying they are not supported by the science as the government has consistently claimed it said pictures of crowded beaches and beauty spots over the weekend showed the public is not keeping to social distancing as it was and the nhs test and trace programme is currently far from being the robust operation that is now urgently required as a safeguard to easing restrictions itv news science editor tom clarke has said he worries that this might be the departure between the scientific advise and the political realities of easing lockdown but the government has insisted lockdown easing is not a dash and any changes are being made in a very cautious way following a host of easing measures groups of up to six people are now allowed to meet outdoors and in private gardens in england those in the clinically extremely vulnerable can now go outdoors and competitive sport is set to resume dr jeanelle de gruchy president of the adph told radio 4 's today programme there was a need to balance easing of restrictions with the risk of causing a resurgence in infections a lot of people including local directors of public health across the country are increasingly concerned that the government is misjudging this balancing act and lifting too many of the restrictions too quickly she said the five tests have n't yet been met in terms of the r a measure of infections produced per person it 's 0.7 to 0.9 in the latest government assessment it is below one but it 's a very limited room for manoeuvre and we know how quickly this virus can spread what can i do when lockdown rules change in england tensions continue over lockdown easing as pupils begin returning to school but business secretary alok sharma insisted that the changes are cautious mr sharma told itv news the measures we are taking are indeed phased they are cautious and they are proportionate we are doing this in a phased manner and actually that is what the scientific advisory group of emergencies has also said that we should do he stressed only certain schools and classes within them are returning from monday in england it comes as one survey suggested nearly half 46 % of families plan to keep pupils at home as classes in england open to children in reception year 1 and year 6 what is the r value and why is the number one so important in stopping the spread of coronavirus a number of scientists have also voiced their concerns at the easing of lockdown professor peter openshaw a member of nervtag the government 's new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group told itv news some are feeling nervous about the changes in some parts particularly in the north of the country there are still a lot of cases around in the community if people start ignoring government advice and thinking it 's perfectly aright to go about their normal business there could be a big resurgence we could experience a second major lockdown professor peter openshaw says there is still a significant risk it 's a concern echoed by dr gruchy of the adph who said the country is not ready for a second wave of covid-19 we 're concerned about meeting all the other operational challenges ready to meet a potential rise in infections she said adding that the national testing programme and the test and trace scheme must be robust and ready and the personal protective equipment ppe supply must be adequate we 're not feeling just yet that we 're confident enough to meet any potential challenge if the government goes too quickly on easing lockdown measures she added itv news correspondent greg easteal reports from thirsk where the market reopened since measures were lifted in a blog on sunday the adph said over the weekend we have seen signs that the public is no longer keeping as strictly to social distancing as it was along with this we are concerned that the resolve on personal hygiene measures and the need to immediately self isolate if symptomatic is waning a relentless effort to regain and rebuild public confidence and trust following recent events is essential it 's unclear if the group is referring to the row that erupted following revelations about the travel of boris johnson 's chief aide dominic cummings who drove 260 miles from london to durham during lockdown widespread contact tracing of coronavirus patients was stopped as phe only had capacity to deal with five people a week boris johnson calls dominic cummings row a political ding dong and wo n't order inquiry the blog said the government 's second test from its list of five a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate was happening but the downward trend is slow particularly in care settings the impact of easing restrictions on the r value was difficult to judge given they were being eased in a rapid way it added as we saw in march r can go above one in a very short space of time and once it does it can take many months to bring it back down what could cause another coronavirus wave which other pandemics have experienced a second peak it warned the room for manoeuvre is tight the adph also said a second peak can not be ruled out and asked do we really want the same number of deaths again the scale to date represents an unimaginable tragedy and we must do everything possible to limit further loss of life coronavirus everything you need to know check

to play hard ball with the prime minister ahead of a fourth round of trade talks this week as he insisted the prospect of a no deal end to the transition period this year would be compounded by the impact of the covid-19 crisis mr barnier told the sunday times there would not be an agreement at any cost with talks on future trading arrangements seemingly in deadlock over issues like fisheries britain has only until july 1 to seek an extension to the transition period has boris johnson just announced no deal brexit for january 2021 government to walk away from eu trade talks as early as june mr johnson has repeatedly insisted that the uk will end the transition arrangement on schedule at the end of the year however mr barnier accused britain of not keeping its commitments the uk has been taking a step back two steps back three steps back from the original commitments the eus chief negotiator said the uk negotiators need to be fully in line with what the prime minister signed up to with us because 27 heads of state and government and the european parliament do not have a short memory mr barnier said the eus heads of state remembered very clearly the text which we negotiated with boris johnson and we just want to see that complied with to the letter and if that does nt happen there will be no agreement he told the paper mr barnier insisted uk withdrawal from the eu was a lose lose for both sides saying no one not even nigel farage had shown there was any added value to the uks departure he said therefore the natural next step in trade negotiations was damage limitation and if no agreement were reached that would result in even more consequences at the worst time possible given the coronavirus pandemic so i think we have a joint responsibility in this very serious crisis which affects so many families with so many deaths so many sick people so many people unemployed to do everything we can to reach an agreement and i very much hope that we will do so he

the go ahead to return from monday while boris johnson announced new freedoms for the clinically extremely vulnerable shielding through the crisis competitive sport set to resume in england as government gives green light from monday scientists advising government warn coronavirus lockdown restrictions in england being lifted too fast prof edmunds ' concerns join a growing list of expert

of oxford and sir jeremy farrar to warn that ministers are taking risks all three are members of the sage committee itv news political correspondent paul brand explains as the rules become more nuanced there 's concern about people complying with them speaking to itv news prof edmunds said i think we are taking a bit of a risk at the moment there 's a couple of things one the reproduction number is only just below one at the moment so we do n't have a lot of headroom we ca n't lift things very much at all he continued secondly the incidents are really quiet high so the ons survey we are getting 8000 new infections everyday in england in just the community that 's not counting cases that may occur in hospitals and care homes and even other settings such as prisons that 's quite a lot of cases 8,000 everyday coronavirus test and trace system launching in england lockdown easing for coronavirus ' shielders in england prime minister announces the government says it has met its

the track and trace is going to be more effective if the cases are lower he added i do n't think we will have a major second peak i do nt think the government would ever let that happen my issue is if we keep the incidents flat test and trace system wo n't be fully operational until end of june ' mps told what is the r value and why is the number one so important in stopping the spread of coronavirus deputy chief medical officer for england professor jonathan van tam was quizzed on the comments made by prof edmunds and some other sage members at saturday 's downing street briefing prof van tam said our science advice has been so far that the social distancing that has already been eased is consistent with keeping the r below one the consensus of scientific advice is that the next set of measures announced for monday with contact tracing in place should also keep the r within one our advice is then to continue to watch this very carefully and we will continue to give further advice to the government about whether we think it is possible to make further easements after that he added that scientific opinions always vary to some extent prof van tam stressed the nhs test and trace system will also help keep the infection under control hosting the briefing cuture sectreary olive dowden said it must be remembered there are more than 50 scientists in sage all of whom will have their different perspectives when asked about the difficulty of asking people to return to a stricter lockdown if the r rate increases mr dowden said the government has been taking very tentative steps while emphasising the need to maintain social distancing on saturday night professor anthony costello a former world health organisation director was another scientist to warn about the government 's handling of the crisis he tweeted the uk could face a resurgence of covid-19 the easing of england 's lockdown will also see the reopening of some schools from monday as well more shops starting to resume trading along with outdoor retailers and car showrooms groups of up to six people from different households will be able to exercise together from monday too while maintaining social distancing prof edmunds told itv news the message we are getting from the government seems to be to rush this a little bit i do n't see how we are at the moment taking small steps and taking it incrementally it does n't seem to me to be like that it 's the combination of taking multiple steps altogether that worries me england 's lifting of restrictions goes further than the easing of lockdowns announced in the other three nations in scotland people can now meet others from one other household at a time as long as it is outdoors first minister nicola sturgeon has warned that social distancing should continue and groups can only be a maximum of eight people people in wales will be allowed to meet up with others outdoors from monday while in northern ireland more retailers can

alert level had been lowered from level four to level three when the alert scheme was announced by mr johnson earlier this month the uk was at level four of five which said that current social distancing measures and restrictions would remain in place at level three there can be a gradual relaxing of restrictions and social distancing measures mr sunak did not confirm whether the threat level was still at level four or had been lowered to level three but when asked if it was risky to relax restrictions before the alert level had been lowered mr sunak told the daily downing street press briefing on friday that the restrictions could be eased because the governments five tests had been met itv news political correspondent libby wiener on why there are different rules on easing the lockdown in the uk 's four nations he added we set out the five tests very clearly and because we are now meeting the five tests because of the heroic efforts of everyone at home the nhs everyone we are in a position to carefully and deliberately start to release the restrictions i would nt say that that s happening in a reckless or big bang way as the prime minister set out its been done in quite a measured and phased way progressively to make sure that we can keep an eye on things and were not running before we should however jeremy farrar director of the wellcome trust and a member of the scientific advisory group for emergencies sage which advises the government on coronavirus has said lockdown measures are being lifted too early in a post on twitter he said he agreed with john on

restrictions before the coronavirus threat level was lowered mr sunak said that the government was listening very strongly to scientific advisers he added there has been no change in the dialogue or relationship we have or the advice we receive we remain very cognisant of the scientific advice very engaged with it and listening to it very strongly mr sunaks comments come after a police and crime

weekend there are fears mr johnsons announcement on thursday will result in a difficult couple of days for authorities northumbrias labour police and crime commissioner kim mcguinness said one of the hallmarks of the governments handling of this deadly pandemic has sadly been a series of mistimed and badly explained messages by pre - announcing changes to lockdown ahead of a tempting weekend of

maidenhead berkshire mrs may said said she can well understand the anger of people who had obeyed the guidance while the pms aide drove from london to a family farm in durham she added what this matter has shown is that there was a discrepancy between the simple messages given by the government and the details of the legislation passed by parliament in these circumstances i do not feel that mr cummings followed the spirit of the guidance i can well understand the anger of those who have been abiding by the spirit of the guidance given by the government and expect others to do so police cummings ' barnard castle trip might have been minor breach of rules senior mps grill johnson over cummings row at liaison committee but in the message seen by the pa news agency mrs may said she was concerned that the focus on mr cummings was detracting from the most important task of dealing with coronavirus she added one of my biggest concerns has been that the ongoing focus on mr cummings has been detracting from the most important task which is dealing with coronavirus and starting the process of recovery and easing lockdown her message emerged a day after durham constabulary said it would have taken action if police officers had stopped mr cummings on his 50-mile round trip to barnard castle but the force said it did not consider mr cummings had committed an offence by locating himself at his fathers farm in the county prime minister boris johnson said on thursday he regarded the issue as closed after the police said they did not intend to take retrospective action though

hope that with the governments help they might find a way through this terrible recession but the cost of the taxpayer support is high and rising towards 100bn this scheme can not continue and the chancellor has now set out the details of how it will be withdrawn businesses have applauded the decision to allow them to bring back staff part time from july instead of august they are also being asked to shoulder a lower share of cost of the scheme than had been expected or leaked to journalists but the chancellor is asking them to start paying for it and this creates a reckoning a moment of

body while china provides about 40 million dollars 32 million the us is the largest source of financial support to the who and its exit is expected to significantly weaken the organisation president

to temporarily halt trials of hydroxychloroquine as a potential coronavirus treatment a drug mr trump had triumphed mr trump also announced that the united states will begin the process of withdrawing special trade benefits for hong kong because of the chinese government 's imposition of a new security law in the semi - autonomous city tensions over hong kong have been increasing for more than a year as china has cracked down on protesters and sought to exert more control over the former british territory president trump said the administration would begin eliminating the full range of agreements that had given hong kong a relationship with the us that mainland china lacked including on trade and extradition he said the state department would begin warning us citizens of the threat of surveillance and arrest when visiting the city the president also said the us would be suspending entry of certain chinese citizens he did not provide specifics but officials said this week that

negotiator has pledged that any request for an extension to the brexit transition period from the eu will be rejected david frost said that the governments position on the issue is pretty clear and that negotiators are working towards an end of year deadline mr frost was answering questions from peers on the house of lords eu committee on the progress of uk eu future relationship negotiations alongside cabinet office minister michael gove eu open to two year brexit extension says michel barnier lord wood of anfield asked mr frost it sounds like the june deadline for an extension request is neither here nor there it wo nt be used under any circumstances is that true are there any circumstances for doing the negotiations that would prompt you to actually consider an extension request mr frost responded the governments positions pretty clear that we are not going to ask for an extension and if the eu asks for one we will not agree to that so i think that s just part of the framework now and were working to an end year deadline directing a question to mr gove lord wood said if indeed the european council comes back and says look we really do need a little extension for this transition period in order to get the basics sorted out is the governments position that it will say no to that request giving a short response mr gove said yes progress in post - brexit talks are disappointing says barnier david frost also told peers said that the letter he sent to michel barnier after the third round of talks between uk and eu negotiators was intended to show that an agreement is perfectly possible baroness neville rolfe said your letter suggested that its quite possible that a deal wo nt be concluded by the end of the year at least i think in several important respects i mean it seems to me there ll be some economic challenges but there could also be some opportunities from that situation clarity i think you ve already mentioned could you expand on the opportunitys side mr frost well first of all i would say its not our preference we would like to get a deal and certainly my letter was not intended to signal that we were looking not to reach an agreement far from it it was intended to show that an agreement is perfectly possible provided that the eu did not bring new and unprecedented elements to the discussion and we would still like to reach an agreement video report by itv news correspondent damon green from monday lockdown in england will ease to allow up to six people to meet in private gardens provided those from different households continue to stick to social distancing rules boris johnson has announced the prime minister said the five tests for easing lockdown in england had been met meaning the government could move forward with adjusting the lockdown on monday schools will also be opened up to more children from monday including reception and years one and six as well as nurseries a fortnight later on june 15 secondary schools will begin to provide some face to face contact time for years 10 and 12 the prime minister said mr johnson said closing schools has deprived children of their education and as so often it is the most disadvantaged pupils who risk being hardest hit outdoor shops such as markets and car showrooms where social distancing is generally easier will also reopen from monday on june 15 other non - essential retail outlets will reopen but only provided the five tests are still being met and shops have been made covid secure mr johnson said after saying that up to six people can meet outdoors mr johnson said people should try to avoid seeing too many households in quick succession so we can avoid the risk of quick transmission from lots of different families and continue to control the virus he said the changes mean that friends and family can start to meet their loved ones perhaps seeing both parents at once or both grandparents at once police cummings ' barnard castle trip might be a minor breach contact tracing system launched amid anger over cummings he added at the downing street briefing it remains the case that people should not be inside the homes of their friends and families unless it is to access the garden i should add that at this stage i am afraid that those who have been asked to shield themselves should continue to do so mr johnson said the government is looking carefully at how we can make your life easier adding we want to say more on that soon the prime minister thanked the public for showing caution during lockdown its not my achievement or the governments achievement it is your achievement he said but he warned ministers will put on the brakes as required and said lockdown restrictions will be reinforced where necessary a new track and trace system launched on thursday is said to be essential in the government working out where to reintroduce restrictions nhs track and trace now employs 25,000 contact tracers and in weeks will incorporate an accompanying app to help health officials work out where coronavirus exists in the uk the uk 's death toll was revealed to be at 37,837 as the press conference began an increase of 337 prime minister johnson said the uk 's daily death rate now stands at 256 down from a peak of 943 on april 14 and the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board he said this combined with just 11 % of ventilators currently being used shows the nhs is able to cope with coronavirus he also said testing capacity is at 161,214 a day and contracts have been signed for nearly two billion items of ppe all of this he said allowed him to make limited and cautious changes to the lockdown labour leader sir keir starmer said his party supports the easing of some lockdown restrictions if safe we support the gradual easing of restrictions on lockdown its got to be safe and we need clear guidance from public health and we also need to see the scientific evidence actually published when asked whether the government had been slow to recognise the impact of social restrictions on the public sir keir continued we ve asked a lot of the public and its largely thanks to what they ve done that were in this position so we do support the gradual easing of these restrictions its got to be done safely and we do need clear guidance the publics given a huge amount in this the pm admitted that some anomalies or apparent inconsistencies in the new rules are inevitable adding clearly what were proposing is still just a fraction of the social interaction each of us would normally enjoy i know many of you will find this frustrating and i am sorry about that but i m afraid it is unavoidable given the nature of the invisible enemy we are fighting at the briefing mr johnson was repeatedly questioned about the row surrounding his top aid dominic cummings and his trip from london to durham during the lockdown the pm did not answer questions put to him and said he intends to draw a line under the controversy he also said he would not allow advisors professor chris whitty and sir patrick vallance to answer questions on the row to protect them from a political argument the pair agreed they did not want to answer political questions mr johnson said i ve said quite a lot on this matter already and what i also note is that what durham police said was that they were going to take no action and that the matter was closed and i intend to draw a line under the matter as i said yesterday to the parliamentary liaison committee video report by itv news political correspondent carl dinnen dominic cummings might have committed a minor breach of lockdown rules when he made a journey to barnard castle durham police 's investigation has concluded mr cummings boris johnson 's chief aide made a 260-mile trip to stay close to his parents in durham when he was ill with coronavirus symptoms during lockdown durham police does not consider an offence was committed by making the journey dominic cummings ' durham trip timeline of events does coronavirus affect eyesight contact tracing system launched amid anger over cummings but mr cummings made a further trip to check his driving ability following eye sight difficulties which he had suffered while ill itv news political editor robert peston has more on the row durham police say that in making the 52-mile round journey there might have been a minor breach of coronavirus regulations that would have warranted police intervention the force said the breach is considered minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing it added had a durham constabulary police officer stopped mr cummings driving to or from barnard castle the officer would have spoken to him and having established the facts likely advised mr cummings to return to the address in durham providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis had this advice been accepted by mr cummings no enforcement action would have been taken mr cummings insists he acted lawfully and reasonably when making a trip to durham during lockdown and he has been backed up by the prime minister the 48-year old said he had made the trip so he could be closer to childcare should he or his wife become incapacitated by the illness responding to the durham police statement a number 10 spokesman said the police have made clear they are taking no action against mr cummings over his self isolation and that going to durham did not breach the regulations the prime minister has said he believes mr cummings behaved reasonably and legally given all the circumstances and he regards this issue as closed durham police added how there was insufficient evidence to support allegations that mr cummings made a further trip to durham on april 19 the prime minister has resisted sufficient pressure to sack mr cummings for making the journey during an appearance at the liaison committee on wednesday mr johnson described the story as a political ding dong and said we would not be ordering an inquiry labour leader sir keir starmer said mr johnson 's refusal to sack mr cummings showed he was too weak to act sir keir who has said he would have sacked the adviser if he was pm said boris johnson should have drawn a line under the dominic cummings saga but was too weak to act the public have sacrificed so much for the health of our nation which he s now undermined and sent a message that there s one rule for them and another for the british people asked by committee chair sir bernard jenkin why an inquiry had not been ordered into mr cummings ' journey the pm said he is not certain looking into the matter would be a very good use of official time after news broke of mr cummings ' trip several cabinet ministers put out statements defending the aide 's actions the dogged defence of mr cummings has resulted in many accusing the government of allowing the lockdown message to be confused labour 's yvette cooper told prime minister johnson he was putting political concerns ahead of clear public health messages an accusation he denied the reason you sent all of your ministers out to say fudgey things and unclear things is because you are trying not to incriminate dominic cummings and you do nt want to apologise for him she added man makes 30

discharge at least 1,800 patients from hospital into care homes during the coronavirus pandemic the government has denied there was pressure to move people from hospital into care after care england recently blamed discharges for spreading the virus into nursing and residential homes but data obtained by itv news shows how at the outset of the pandemic the nhs and councils block booked beds in care homes to ensure they were ready to deal with a surge in patients coming from hospital nhs clinical commissioning groups and councils in 17 regions of england replied to itv news telling us that they had reserved a total of 1,800 beds in care homes including 182 beds in suffolk 122 in the wirral and 86 in oxfordshire until mid - april patients were not routinely tested for coronavirus before being discharged into a home with care managers having previously told itv news that they believe that s how the virus spread among their residents the government advice to hospitals prior to april 15 was negative tests are not required prior to transfers / admissions into the care home itv news has also discovered some homes are continuing to take covid-19 positive patients despite their concerns reporting on the coronavirus crisis in care homes from paul brand covid-19 deaths in care homes top 10,000 but how did they happen desperate care homes plea with council for immediate financial support itv news reveals first care home closing due to coronavirus excl care home residents told they are unlikely to be offered ventilators at saint cecilias nursing home in scarborough fifteen beds

are isolated on the second floor of the home with painstaking precautions taken to prevent the virus spreading to other occupants those with covid-19 are barrier nursed meaning full ppe is worn by all staff with deep cleaning of the ward several times a day the managing director of the home mike padgham says he has been left with little choice but to continue accepting covid-19 patients given the financial pressures he faces and the need to help the nhs but he admitted that the arrangement does worry him he said without taking in covid-19 patients the business is not viable and that people might have to move or staff might lose their job so it 's not an easy decision to make i 've had a few sleepless nights over it to be honest but i 'm doing my bit and taking advice from everybody and

cummings ' barnard castle trip might be a minor breach test and trace system wo n't be fully operational until end of june but the owner anita astle says she has been taken advantage of by her local ccg its been really frustrating as we ve had people admitted for short term care its turned out that they re with us for the 14 days until they re clear of covid its made us feel like a covid cleansing house and put unnecessary strain on our staff and we ve decided were not doing that anymore today when we questioned the health secretary he did nt deny that there had always been a plan to discharge patients into homes after being asked several times whether block bookings were made as part of a plan to discharge covid-19 patients into hospital matt hancock did not provide a direct answer instead he insisted the number of people being discharged had fallen during the pandemic we actually managed to reduce the number of people who were going from hospital into care homes that number came down by around 40 % he said it is important that infection control is in place in the care home so in some care homes splitting the care home into an area where people have covid and areas that are protected and have that strong infection control that may be the way forward he added nhs england has so far declined to provide data on the total number of discharges into care homes during the pandemic despite several requests from itv news responding to our report labours shadow care minister liz kendall said while the prime minister has claimed that there was nt a concerted effort to move people out of hospitals into care homes this shows the opposite and that government measures to quickly discharge people from hospitals may have contributed to the tragedy that has unfolded in social care ministers must learn lessons from what has happened so far they must get a grip of this crisis implement a full strategy for supporting care homes and give care services the priority and resources they deserve the scottish government has already disclosed that more than 900 patients were discharged into hospital there before mandatory testing took place giving evidence to the liaison committee on wednesday the prime minister denied there was concerted effort to discharge patients from hospitals into care homes in response to a question from former health secretary jeremy hunt boris johnson said he did not get any advice that discharging hospital patients into care homes could spread coronavirus watch boris johnson 's liaison committee appearance in full it 's just not true that there was some concerted effort to move people out of nhs beds into care homes that 's just not right he said in relation to wren hall nottingham and nottinghamshire ccg and nottinghamshire county council provided a joint statement saying health and care professionals have offered support around all the issues raised by mrs astle the statement went on but we recognise that there are some unique issues which have made wren hall more financially vulnerable than others particularly the costs associated with operating a specialist dementia care facility we will continue to provide close support to wren hall with a focus on discharge planning as well as staff testing and training video report by itv news political correspondent carl dinnen boris johnson has attempted to downplay allegations against his advisor dominic cummings describing the row over his trip from london to durham as a political ding dong and refusing to order an inquiry into the alleged lockdown breach the prime minister said many of the allegations against mr cummings were totally false but declined to provide any evidence to prove his claims mr johnson was facing questions from the liaison committee after his chief aide mr cummings made a 260-mile trip to his parents ' farm in durham with his family while his wife had coronavirus symptoms during lockdown the 48-year old said he had made the trip so he could be closer to childcare should he or his wife become incapacitated by the illness mr cummings has denied wrongdoing saying he believed he acted reasonably and within the law by making the journey asked by committee chair sir bernard jenkin why an inquiry had not been ordered into mr cummings ' journey the pm said he is not certain looking into the matter would be a very good use of official time itv political editor robert peston analyses the latest developments coronavirus test and trace system launching in england mr johnson said a lot of what was written and said about mr cummings ' trip was n't correct however when asked by mp meg hillier if he would provide evidence to the cabinet secretary mr johnson declined i think actually that it would not be doing my job if i were not to shuffle this problem into the hands of officials he said he acknowledged the great political interest in the story and said he could understand public indignation but said it would be much better if we could now move on and focus on the next steps of the fight against coronavirus the prime minister was accused of causing confusion over the government 's lockdown message by his defence of mr cummings labours yvette cooper citing a survey by mumsnet said a quarter of parents did nt have access to local childcare when they had covid-19 and were in exactly the same circumstances as dominic cummings she said a third of those parents told the survey they 'd be more likely to break the rules now following the news government furlough scheme now covers 8.4 million workers lockdown rules what can and ca n't you do now she asked if the prime minister now wanted people to follow advice from health experts who say stay at home unless there s a risk to life or she asked in the words of robert jenrick this morning if you do nt have ready access to childcare then you can do as dominic cummings did which is it responding the pm said if you have exceptional problems with childcare then that may cause you to vary your arrangements and that s clear ms cooper unhappy with the answer accused mr johnson of ducking questions and said he was doing so to protect his advisor she said he was putting political concerns ahead of clear public health messages an accusation he denied the reason you sent all of your ministers out to say fudgey things and unclear things is because you are trying not to incriminate dominic cummings and you do nt want to apologise for him she added he hit back urging mps to lay aside party political points scoring and put national interest first earlier in the committee mr johnson was asked by snp pete wishart to apologise on mr cummings ' behalf however he appeared to decline he said i am sorry for the pain as i ve said the anguish and the heartbreak of so many people in this country asked if he believed mr cummings ' behaviour had been a distraction mr johnson disagreed saying the public want us to focus on them and their needs rather than on a political ding dong about what one advisor may or may not have done the prime minister said mr cummings was allowed to give his own press conference so the public could understand what i had understood myself previously a poll conducted after the news of mr cummings ' trip broke showed some 59 % of britons think he should resign and at least 40 tory mps have now called for his resignation including former scotland minister douglas ross who resigned over the government 's response to the news backbench tories to call for him to resign include mark harper sir roger gale and steve baker the prime minister 's appearance at the committee was arranged last week after he was invited by chair sir bernard jenkin sir bernard 's appointment to the committee 's chairmanship made following a recommendation from number 10 has been criticised by mps who view him as too close to the prime minister ahead of the prime minister 's appearance senior tories tom tugendhat and tobias ellwood were told they had not been selected to attend tory mps have indicated to itv news political correspondent paul brand that the exclusions ordered by sir bernard had been made to give the pm an easy ride watch the full commons liaison committee the liaison committee is the only commons committee able to question the prime minister and it gets to do so usually three times a year this is mr johnson 's first appearance at the committee in 10 months as prime minister he has cancelled three previously arranged appearances at wednesday 's appearance he refused to commit to another appearance before the summer the committee is made up of the chairs of the house of commons select committee the european union is open to a two year brexit delay chief negotiator michel barnier has confirmed in a letter to the westminster leaders of the snp lib dems plaid cymru sdlp green party and alliance party mr barnier said the option of an extension to the brexit transition period is available if the uk wants it but the uks chief negotiator david frost told mps the firm policy of the government remains not to extend beyond the end of the year why the cummings crisis is now all about how johnson governs boris johnson will not face investigation over jennifer arcuri opposition mps write to eu negotiator to seek brexit talks extension the leaders of these parties had written to mr barnier on may 15 calling for a two year extension to be agreed between the uk and the eu amid a negotiation deadlock the snps westminster leader ian blackford welcomed the letter and called on boris johnson to accept the offer to help protect the economy during the coronavirus pandemic the brexit transition began when the uk legally left the eu on january 31 and is due to conclude at the end of the year mr frost told the commons committee on the future relationship with the european union on wednesday that is the firm policy of the government that we will not extend the transition period and if asked we would not agree to it in his letter mr barnier said such an extension of up to one or two years can be agreed jointly by the two parties the european union has always said that we remain open on this matter any extension decision has to be taken by the joint committee before july 1 and must be accompanied by an agreement on a financial contribution by the united kingdom responding to the letter mr blackford said boris johnson must finally put his responsibilities to jobs living standards and the economy first and urgently agree the two year extension on offer to the transition period it would be madness to pile a brexit crisis on top of the coronavirus crisis we already face with unemployment soaring businesses shedding jobs and many struggling to survive time is running out there is just a month left to agree an extension to prevent the uk crashing out with a devastating bad deal or a catastrophic no deal if the prime minister fails to agree an extension he will be responsible for every job lost every income slashed and every business that goes under as a result of his bad brexit deal the snp will continue to press for a long extension to protect scotlands economy but the only way to guarantee scotlands interests and protect our place at the heart of europe is to become an independent country lib dem leadership candidate layla moran urged mr johnson to put his pride aside and agree to an extension she said the transition period was designed to give us time to secure a trade deal and make preparations for it to come into effect that time has already and understandably been decimated by the coronavirus response this makes a dangerous no deal brexit more likely at the end of the year unless we extend the transition period i am urging the prime minister to put his pride aside tackle the crisis in front of him and take the extension he s being offered downing street has defended its decision to not review fines given to parents travelling for childcare during lockdown after matt hancock said he would look into it a number 10 spokesman said the enforcement of fines is a matter for police hopes had been sparked that fines could be refunded after the health secretary responding to a question at tuesday evening 's coronavirus press conference said it was perfectly reasonable for ministers to consider a review mr hancock was asked about a potential review by martin a vicar from brighton who was seemingly making reference to a trip made by the pm 's chief aide dominic cummings from london to durham mr cummings has defended his actions claiming he was in an exceptional circumstance and travelled to his parents house in order to be closer to childcare should he and his wife become incapacitated by covid-19 the advisor has received the backing of boris johnson and several other cabinet ministers leaving many to wonder whether lockdown rules were open to interpretation why the cummings crisis is now all about how johnson governs government furlough scheme now covers 8.4 million workers will the government review all penalty fines imposed on families travelling for childcare purposes during lockdown vicar martin asked health secretary matt hancock said he would talk to my treasury colleagues to work out whether the 30 fines could be refunded but after the press conference a downing street source said the fines would not be reviewed on wednesday the prime minister 's spokesman it was up to police whether to enforce fines the spokesman told a westminster briefing were confident that the police will use their common sense and discretion they have been very clear throughout that they will explain encourage and finally enforce fines are always used by police as a last resort dominic cummings ' durham trip timeline of events dominic cummings six lingering questions boris johnson to face grilling over top aide dominic cummings itv news political editor robert peston said he had learnt that the government does n't think that it 's going to have to pay any of those fines back or there 's anything to review it follows a tough few days for the government after it was revealed mr cummings apparently flouted lockdown rules when he had coronavirus symptoms in a press conference on monday he said he believed he acted reasonably and within the law by making the journey adding how he only made the trip due to fears over a lack of childcare if he and his wife became too ill with covid-19 to look after their four year old son mr cummings added he also made a trip to barnard castle some 30 minutes away from where he was staying while in county durham to test his eyesight which he felt had been affected by the respiratory disease and he wanted to go for a test drive before returning with his family to london the national police chiefs council has confirmed forces have no plans to conduct a review of fines issued for people travelling for childcare a spokesman said we have no plans to conduct a review of fines issued for people travelling for childcare as the legislation included accessing childcare as one of the reasonable excuses for leaving home it is very unlikely that a significant number of fines would have been issued in such circumstances policings approach has been to engage explain encourage and only enforce as a last resort this has been promoted consistently since the introduction of the restrictions if anyone believes they have been issued a fine in error for any reason they can challenge it at court the eu commission is proposing a 750 billion euro recovery 670bn fund to help the blocs economy through the deep recession induced by the coronavirus pandemic commissioner paolo gentiloni said mr gentiloni who is in charge of economic affairs at the eus executive body confirmed the size of the fund in a tweet boris johnson to face grilling over top aide dominic cummings medics who cancelled wedding due to covid-19 marry in hospital government will not review fines given to parents seeking childcare the bloc has been deeply divided over what conditions should be attached to the funds to help revive ailing economies the move wednesday comes as the 27-nation trading bloc is set to enter its deepest ever recession virtually every country has broken the eus deficit rules danny kruger the young tory mp who is an old friend of dominic cummings and his spouse got it right last night the affaire cummings as the french would put it is no longer about the most powerful aide to the prime minister and the minutiae of how he interpreted coronavirus quarantine rules differently from most of the country kruger argued that attacks on cummings are attacks on boris johnson because the pm has so conspicuously become cummingss human shield so as another tory mp told me a grandee no less this is now all about the pm himself and how he governs it is about why boris johnson rates cummings so highly and why he needs him at the centre of his government boris johnson to face grilling over top aide dominic cummings peston dominic cummings becomes the symbol of what he hates that is what the official representatives of the parliamentary tory party the executive of the 1922 committee want from the pm not cummingss head they would nt say no to it but they accept it is in the pms discretion to hire and fire aides but an account from the pm of why cummings matters so much to the way his government operates and why his cabinet seemingly matters so little as tory mps tell me what the debacle has exposed as if that was not already obvious is the power of cummings symbolised in his use of the downing street garden for his press conference and the weakness of cabinet ministers despatched to dispense barely credible justifications of cunmingss actions we wo nt insist on cummings being sacked said an influential tory mp if the pm feels he can not manage this crisis without him so be it and of course he and his confreres understand the important part cummings played in delivering brexit and the general election victory but for us the price will be that the prime minister has to change his cabinet and bring in members with more substance and backbone there is little or no precedent for any pm retaining an adviser in post when it is patently obvious an overwhelming majority of voters think the aide should go and when the perception of what the aide did has so undermined the credibility of the only government policies that matter the measures to suppress covid-19 but to state the obvious sorry these are new times there wo nt be an election for four years the coronavirus disaster is of a magnitude beyond any challenge faced by any government for generations and this prime minister has no one in cabinet or elsewhere he trusts and needs in the way he trusts and needs cummings there is no osborne to his cameron or even a truculent brown to his blair he is isolated and for all his formidable campaigning skills he is is not a natural chief executive the precipitate collapse of the ratings in opinion polls of tory party and boris johnson are almost irrelevant the point is that they are probably as nothing compared to what will happen to the tory partys poll rating when the grim long term damage to our living standards and way of life of coronavirus reveal themselves in around three months the decision for johnson is how to prepare for the nightmare ahead and it will be a nightmare if johnson is convinced he can not cope without cummings a majority of his mps may well give him the benefit of the doubt but they would like more of a voice and that means appointing ministers who hear them as well as taking orders in effect from cummings what this debacle is all about is not one aide and his putative transgressions it is about whether the parliamentary bit of our parliamentary democracy still has a voice video report by itv news political reporter shehab khan boris johnson is facing questions by senior mps over the coronavirus crisis as calls for his key adviser to resign over his travel continue to grow the prime minister is appearing at a commons committee meeting on the decision of his top aide dominic cummings to travel from london to durham during the shutdown it comes amid a growing revolt from within mr johnsons party with at least 40 tory mps having now publicly called for mr cummings to be sacked or to resign and a yougov survey for the times showed the conservative lead over labour dropped by nine points during the cummings saga as support for the government fell four points to 44 % with labour rising five points in the week to tuesday to 38 % minister resigns over number 10 response to cummings ' trip peston cummings becomes the symbol of what he hates government will not review fines given to parents seeking childcare senior ministers have expressed public support for the defiant adviser but there are reports a number of cabinet members have privately called for him to be ousted from no 10 housing secretary robert jenrick said the moment has come for us to move on from the row surrounding mr cummings although this issue is important and many people disagree with the way that mr cummings behaved we now need to focus on the wider issues of controlling the virus reopening and restarting the economy he added mr jenrick confirmed the government would not be holding a formal review of coronavirus penalty fines issued to parents travelling for childcare during the lockdown after mr cummings made a trip to his parent 's house so he could be closer to childcare should he and his wife become incapacitated by covid-19 imposing a fine is a decision for police and so its right we leave this at their discretion under the law they have their own guidance issued by the national police chiefs council and that gives them a degree of discretion respecting the fact that individual circumstances are different and there are particular challenges faced by some people in society not least parents with children its right we respect the polices right to impose fines if they wish to but shadow foreign secretary lisa nandy told itv news its becoming increasingly clear that people do nt have that level of confidence in the government and what they re being told we said that the pm needs to urgently answer questions about the inconsistencies in the account that emerged over the weekend and if he ca nt answer those questions then he needs to consider whether dominic cummings position is tenable she added mr johnsons appearance via video link at wednesdays commons liaison committee hearing has been tinged with controversy over the fact the pm will only briefly be quizzed on the cummings affair mps will have a maximum of 20 minutes in a 90-minute session to probe the situation when mr johnson appears before the committee itv news political correspondent carl dinnen says people will be asking boris johnson about the dominic cummings ' row for some time to come asked about the situation regarding mr cummings liaison committee chairman sir bernard jenkin told the pa news agency i have got no intention of preventing any subject any member of the committee wants to raise the comment follows controversy over sir bernards appointment to the committee chairmanship with some mps saying he is too close to the prime minister sir bernard insisted the format for the session has been agreed by the committee also among those questioning the pm will be labour chairwoman of the home affairs committee yvette cooper and tory chairman of the health committee jeremy hunt the other mps set to question boris johnson at the liaison committee clive betts greg clark stephen crabb robert halfon meg hillier simon hoare darren jones huw merriman caroline nokes mel stride stephen timms pete wishart mr cummings said he had driven to durham to isolate in a property on his fathers farm because of concerns over care for his four year old son if both he and his wife were incapacitated by covid-19 but a growing number of conservative mps have voiced their frustration over mr cummings after he expressed no regrets about his trip to durham on tuesday douglas ross the parliamentary under secretary of state for scotland quit the government saying he could not in good faith defend mr cummings actions tory grandee sir roger gale said the conservative backbench 1922 committee should make it clear to the pm his adviser should go the time i think has come for mr cummings to resign or for the pm to dispense of his services the north thanet mp told the pa news agency there are people on the 1922 executive who are courageous and that s their job they are elected to tell the pm what he needs to hear not what he wants to hear labour leader sir keir starmer has said the party 's new general secretary will help restore trust with the british people david evans who worked for labour under the leadership of tony blair and was seen as the favourite of sir keir was backed for the role by the partys ruling national executive committee nec on tuesday minister accused of spreading fake news about labour leader keir starmer demands ' clear directions from boris johnson to ease lockdown sir keir said i look forward to working with david to build a team that can help us restore trust with the british people and build a team that can win the next election former assistant general secretary mr evans said we face a defining period in the history of our great party with a global pandemic an imminent recession and a mountain to climb to win the next election the appointment follows the stepping down of jennie formby a close ally of ex - leader jeremy corbyn from the role sir keir said that ms formby had quit by mutual consent one of mr evans key issues will be dealing with allegations of anti - semitism by some party members and a probe by the equalities watchdog into the situation the equalities and human rights commissions inquiry is set to be made public soon after years of internal strife within the party over how allegations of anti - semitism have been handled the appointment is being seen as a boost for sir keir who took over after the worst labour result in a general election since the 1930s last december the government has denied it will review coronavirus penalty fines issued to parents travelling for childcare during the lockdown after the health secretary said ministers would look at it at the daily coronavirus update matt hancock faced several questions relating to a 260-mile trip made by the prime minister 's chief aide dominic cummings during lockdown however one question posed by a member of the public initially appeared to have sparked a potential policy change martin a vicar from brighton asked about

good question and we do understand the impact and the need for making sure that children get adequate childcare that is one of the significant concerns that we have had all the way through this he

within the guidelines set out by the government after all the guidelines allow for exceptional circumstances particularly with regards to childcare and we ve stated before that if you re unable to

integrity following a difficult day in which some tory backbench mps called for the aide to resign mr johnson told the press conference he firmly backs mr cummings saying his aide acted in the best interests of his child in a way any parent would frankly understand he added i have concluded that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare at the moment when both he and his wife were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus and when he had no alternative i think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent and i do not mark him down for that his comments followed calls from tory mps including prominent member of the 1922 committee steve baker mr baker became the first conservative mp to publicly say mr cummings should resign and should resign now tory mp sir roger gale also described mr cummings ' position as untenable damian collins joined the calls for mr cummings to go saying the government would be better off without him may 25 mr cummings holds a very rare press conference the prime minister 's top aide attempted to justify his trip to durham by holding his own press conference mr cummings said in a statement in the downing street rose garden i believe in all the circumstances i behaved reasonably and legally furthermore mr cummings denied he had broken the spirit of the rules and said he had not offered his resignation to the prime minister mr cummings said his decision to drive 264 miles from london to county durham was based not only on fears over a lack of childcare if he became incapacitated with covid-19 but also concerns about his familys safety i do nt regret what i did he said i think reasonable people may well disagree about how i thought about what to do in the circumstances but i think what i did was actually reasonable in these circumstances the rules made clear that if you are dealing with small children that can be exceptional circumstances and i think that the situation that i was in was exceptional circumstances and the way that i dealt with it was the least risk to everybody concerned if my wife and i had both been unable to look after our four year old mr cummings admitted travelling to barnard castle by car to test if he was fit to drive the full journey back to london due to concerns over his vision after recovering from illness april 26 scotland minister resigns over government response to mr cummings ' trip conservative mp douglas ross announced he would be stepping down from his role as scotland minister over the government 's response to the story in a statement mr ross said i have never met dominic cummings so my judgement on this matter has always been open and i accept his statement on monday afternoon clarified the actions he took in what he felt were the best interests of his family however these were decisions many others felt were not available to them he added i have constituents who did n't get to say goodbye to loved ones families who could not mourn together people who did n't visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government i can not in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior advisor to the government was right dominic cummings opened up to the media on monday about his stay in county durham amid lockdown restrictions but despite his press conference lasting an hour many of the powerful downing street advisers explanations did not satisfy everyone and there were more questions left to be answered here are some of them 1 how many breaches of lockdown restrictions did mr cummings commit none if you share mr cummings view others say one still others say two none mr cummings said he his wife mary wakefield and their son travelled by car from london to county durham on the night of march 27 to be near his relatives he said with ms wakefield having fallen ill and with downing street reporting coronavirus cases this was the best option to secure childcare should both he and ms wakefield become unwell mr cummings indeed reported waking up ill the next morning and was soon said by downing street to have coronavirus symptoms because of the childcare issue mr cummings insisted his move was reasonable under the exceptional circumstances clause of the lockdown guidelines he said the 270-mile trip was completed without a stop peston dominic cummings becomes the symbol of what he hates one however many experts said the trip was still a definite breach professor jackie cassell deputy dean of the brighton and sussex medical school said the rules were clear people should not leave major cities to go to second homes in rural areas aside from potentially spreading coronavirus it would place an extra burden on small local hospitals if admission was needed two some reports said that after the cummings familys return to london on april 13 mr cummings made a second visit to durham no regrets papers react to dominic cummings press conference the observer and the sunday mirror quoted an unidentified witness as saying they saw mr cummings walking through houghall woods near his parents property in durham and commenting are nt the bluebells lovely mr cummings on monday denied this second trip and insists photos and data on his phone disprove the reports in any event downing street regularly refused to confirm where mr cummings was self isolating after news broke that he was ill 2 did the cummings family observe social distancing in county durham mr cummings said yes saying the three stayed in isolation in a house on his parents property he said they never entered the homes of his parents or his sister who dropped shopping outside their temporary abode 3 what about the trip to barnard castle mr cummings said he was symptom free but still weak by april 11 and was considering a return to work but he said since his eyesight had been affected by the coronavirus he and ms wakefield decided not to attempt the drive home to london instead the next day the family took a short drive to see if i could drive safely they ended up on the outskirts of barnard castle town he said this was also the day of his wifes 45th birthday dominic cummings i do nt regret what i did mr cummings insists his family did not visit the castle itself or walk around the town he had felt a bit sick and so the only movement made was a walk of 10 to 15 metres to sit on a riverbank for about 15 minutes until he felt better the next day he felt well enough to undertake the long drive back to london and he returned to work one day after that on april 14 4 what did the papers say about the trip to barnard castle the observer and sunday mirror reported an eyewitness 71-year old retired chemistry teacher robin lees saw mr cummings and his family walking in barnard castle town the guardian also reported retired council worker rosalind evans 60 had complained to durham police after reporting seeing mr cummings with a group of people walking in barnard castle town meanwhile several people including police federation chairman john apter have advised people not to drive a car as a means of testing whether their eyesight is impaired pm and top aide say coronavirus affected their eyesight 5 why the darting to and from downing street on march 27 he dashed from downing street where there had been confirmed covid-19 cases to his north london house to see ms wakefield but then when she reported feeling better only two hours later he went back to no 10 he returned home later that day before the drive to durham potentially spreading the disease from london to durham is one issue isolation guidelines strongly suggest the proper thing to do would have been to work from home after his first return to his house that day mr cummings has not fully addressed his movements that day other than the decision to flee to durham 6 was boris johnson aware mr cummings had gone to durham while downing street repeatedly refused to confirm where mr cummings was isolating mr cummings said he had mentioned to the prime minister what he had done in a phone call during his first week in county durham at a time when both men were sick and in bed mr johnson said he remembers a brief conversation with mr cummings in which he learned he was in durham but since he was also seriously ill he really did nt focus on the matter mr johnson said he did not know of mr cummingss plans

podcast all the coronavirus information you need in one place from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus dominic cummings knows all about how perception damages public confidence in political parties here he is in june 2017 people think and by the way i think most people are right the tory party is run by people who basically do nt care about people like me that is what most people in the country have thought about the tory party for decades i know a lot of tory mps and i am sad to say the public is basically correct tory mps largely do not care about these poorer people they do nt care about the nhs and the public has kind of cottoned on to that and this is what he said yesterday about why it was ok to walk in the durham woods when he should have been strictly quarantining because of his covid-19 symptoms at one point the three of us walked into woods owned by my father next to the cottage that i was staying in some people saw us in these woods from a distance but we had no interaction with them we had not left the property we were on private land cummings i do nt regret what i did timeline how the dominic cummings controversy unfolded dominic cummings ' durham trip timeline of events to labour the point cummings is obliged to cite the privileges of his family as justification for his conduct for proof he did nt break the rules we were in the garden but the garden just happens to be a wood the point is that this crisis has shone the brightest light on what many would see as the grotesque inequalities in this country cummingss ability to convalesce on a property with at least three separate houses and extensive land when many couples and single mothers with children who contracted the illness had no outside space at all is by no means the worst manifestation of this unfairness but his self appointed mission in government as someone who refused to join the tory party was to persuade those on lower incomes that boris johnson is not an us and them pm and if anything is causing him angst and self doubt remember yesterday he said he has not for an instant contemplated resigning it is that he the supposed scourge of putative tory self entitlement has become this epidemics symbol of very british inequality the prime minister 's chief aide is still facing calls to resign after allegations he broke the coronavirus

family drove to durham that evening and did not stop on the way he said they stayed in an isolated property on his fathers farm where the following day he woke up in pain and clearly had covid symptoms mr cummings said that by april 11 he was still feeling weak and exhausted but had no coronavirus symptoms so thought he would be able to return to work the following week possibly part time

familys battle with coronavirus in the april 25 issue of the spectator she makes no mention of the trip to durham and describes the challenges of caring for their son while suffering the symptoms of

there is zero chance of him resigning may 23 downing street appears to be standing by the pms chief aide saying in a statement owing to his wife being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell it was essential for dominic cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for at no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter as is being reported speaking to reporters outside his home mr cummings says i behaved reasonably and legally when a reporter suggests his actions did not look good he replies who cares about good looks its a question of doing the right thing its not about what you guys think later at the daily downing street briefing mr shapps says mr cummings has the pms full support and that mr johnson knew that he was unwell and that he was in lockdown mr shapps says it had always been permissible for families to travel to be closer to relatives as long as they go to that location and stay in that location mr johnson also pledged his full support on saturday to his under fire chief adviser meanwhile the deputy chief medical officer for england jenny harries says travelling during

inaccurate stories about mr cummings including claims that he had returned to durham after going back to work in downing street on april 14 we will not waste our time answering a stream of false allegations about mr cummings from campaigning newspapers the spokeperson said may 24 asked by a journalist outside his home whether he had returned to durham in april mr cummings says no i did not a host of tory mps call for him to resign or for mr johnson to sack him but the pm who fronts the daily downing street briefing firmly backs mr cummings saying his aide acted in the best interests of his child in a way any parent would frankly understand he insists mr cummings acted responsibly legally and with integrity the prime minister told a downing street press conference i have had extensive face to face conversations with dominic cummings he said and i have concluded that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare at the moment when both he and his wife were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus and when he had no alternative i think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent and i do not mark him down for that mr johnson added that some of the allegations about mr cummings behaviour during self isolation were palpably false but the pms comments fail to quell anger among tory mps opposition parties scientists and even bishops one of whom accuses mr johnson of treating the public as mugs durham councillor amanda hopgood says she has written to durham constabularys chief constable jo farrell after being made aware of a number of sightings of mr cummings in the area in april and may. mr cummings parents morag and robert defend him in an interview with the new statesman with his mother saying the family had been grieving after her brother lord justice laws died on april 5 after contracting covid-19 while ill in hospital and his father saying he was disgusted at the way the press had treated his son during the coverage the rt revd nick baines bishop of leeds tweeted the question now is do we accept being lied to patronised and treated by a pm as mugs may 25 education secretary gavin williamson adds his support for mr cummings saying he should not resign because he has made it clear that he s broken no rules and he s broken no laws gloucestershires independent police and crime commissioner martin surl says mr cummings actions make a mockery of police enforcement earlier in the lockdown when the message was very very clear stay at home tory mp david warburton says his own father died alone as a result of the coronavirus lockdown and that the cummings story gives an impression of double standards scotlands first minister nicola sturgeon says she fears mr johnson is putting his political interest ahead of the public interest and adds that she hopes he will reflect further on the matter durham police has been asked to establish the facts concerning any potential breach of the law surrounding mr cummings ' visit to the county in a statement the forces acting police crime and victims commissioner steve white said i am confident that thus far durham police has responded proportionately and appropriately to the issues raised concerning mr cummings and his visit to the county at the end of march it is clear however that there is a plethora of additional information circulating in the

gave him his backing following revelations he travelled from london to durham during the lockdown while the prime minister speaking at the downing street press conference said his most senior adviser acted responsibly legally and with integrity there remain questions about mr cummings decision to make the initial journey along with the further allegations levelled against the 48-year old who is dominic cummings and how did he get to no.10 uk civil service tweet labels government truth twisters why did he need to go 260 miles north the argument pushed by number 10 is that mr cummings fearing there would be no one to look after his four year old son if he and his wife became ill with coronavirus at the same time travelled to be near his family in county durham to seek childcare yet labour shadow policing minister sarah jones said in an interview on sky news sophy ridge on sunday programme she knew of single mothers who have had covid-19 when their child has had to stay with them and neighbours and volunteers had to chip in for food so they can eat given the sacrifices made by others critics have queried why mr cummings as someone involved in setting the lockdown rules could not call on any friends or family in london to assist them in adhering to the restrictions did he have covid-19 when travelling the pm tested positive for coronavirus on march 26 and number 10 confirmed mr cummings developed symptoms over the weekend of march 28 - 29 he was seen running out of downing street on march 27 shortly after it was confirmed publicly that mr johnson had the virus on friday a statement issued by durham constabulary suggested mr cummings father had confirmed his son was self isolating in the north east as of march 31 given the average incubation period for covid-19 is five days but can be as long as 14 the four day gap between the two dates suggests he could have been asymptotic while travelling did he stop en route to durham driving 260 miles across the country with a four year old and a sick wife in the car who was already displaying covid-19 symptoms mr cummings might well have needed to stop for a break transport secretary grant shapps was asked during the sunday morning media round about whether the family took a pit stop but said he did not know the answer but he argued mr cummings was a stickler for social distancing rules indicating he would have abided by them during any stop off the cabinet minister said i saw a clip yesterday of him asking journalists to be spaced two metres apart so i know he is a stickler for those rules about what to do to make sure you are following the two metre rule and the like so i m sure that they took all the necessary precautions did he go on a day trip to barnard castle the observer and sunday mirror reported that an eyewitness robin lees a 71-year old former teacher saw mr cummings with his wife and child at barnard castle a popular tourist spot 30 miles from durham on april 12 downing street has not specifically addressed this allegation but mr shapps suggested the easter sunday outing if it took place would have been outside the 14-day period for self isolation government advice is that anyone suffering from coronavirus symptoms must quarantine for seven days after contracting the virus and guidance issued by the national police chiefs council npcc and the college of policing in early april advised officers not to punish people for using their cars to drive a reasonable distance for exercise why is the pm standing by him mr johnson said he thought his aide acted in the best interests of his child acting in a way any parent would frankly understand but tory mps have questioned the conservative leaders judgment in backing him complaining they remain unconvinced by the pms defence former minister paul maynard said mr cummings case seemed utterly indefensible was his son cared for by family while in durham mr cummings defence for his actions along with the pms justification for keeping him on hinges on the belief he and his wife could need childcare if they both became unwell in no 10s saturday statement setting out what went on it made no reference to his son being looked after by family members only that mr cummings sister shopped for the family and left everything outside their property which is said to be adjacent to the family home was the childcare caveat to the stay at home message made clear in government messaging health secretary matt hancock said the governments stay at home guidance was an instruction not a request at a briefing on april 3 but deputy chief medical officer dr jenny harries had said at a daily downing street press briefing on march 24 that a small child could be considered vulnerable and therefore provide exemptions from the stringent rules if their carers became ill dr harries said although we are encouraging everybody to stay in their own householdsclearly if you have adults who are unable to look

his own party mps from across the political spectrum are lining up to condemn boris johnson and his chief adviser a storm of protest continues to rage not only over revelations the prime ministers most senior and most trusted aide broke the governments own lockdown guidelines but also due to mr johnsons defence of mr cummings on sunday mr cummings travelled to county durham in march to self isolate with his family while official guidelines warned against long distance journeys apparently because he feared that he and his wife would be left unable to care for their son further reports also suggested he took a second trip to the north east in april as a government advisor a public statement and questions are extremely rare itv news political correspondent paul brand said he can not recall an advisor ever being publicly questioned in this manner before downing street going to extraordinary lengths to try and keep hold of the pm 's top aide and put the story to bed meanwhile the

confident that thus far durham police has responded proportionately and appropriately to the issues raised concerning mr cummings and his visit to the county at the end of march it is clear however that there is a plethora of additional information circulating in the public domain which deserves appropriate examination he added i have today written to the chief constable asking her to establish the facts concerning any potential breach of the law or regulations in this matter at any juncture it is vital that the force can show it has the interests of the people of county durham and darlington at its heart so that the model of policing by consent independent of government but answerable to the law is maintained itv news political correspondent libby wiener asks whether dominic cummings can explain himself better than his boss did mr cummings ' actions have sparked fury among some mps and led to warnings that he has undermined efforts to fight coronavirus professor stephen reicher a member of the government 's advisory group on behavioural science told itv 's good morning britain if you look at the research it shows the reason why people observed lockdown was not for themselves it was n't because they were personally at risk they did it for the community they did it because of a sense of we 're all in this together if you give the impression there 's one rule for them and one rule for us you fatally undermine that sense of we 're all in this together and you undermine adherence to the forms of behaviour which have got us through this crisis gloucestershire 's independent police and crime commissioner martin surl said mr cummings ' actions made a mockery of police enforcement earlier in the lockdown he told bbc radio 4 's today programme i think it makes it much harder for the police going forward this will be quoted back at them time and time again when they try to enforce the new rules but i think more importantly it makes something of a mockery of the police action going back when the message was very very clear stay at home mr cummings ' alleged actions have also sparked dissent inside tory party ranks somerton and frome mp david warburton told itv news sacrifices were being made across the country in a bid to stop coronavirus spreading and the fact that there are rules in place meant there ought not to be room for any sort of interpretation or following of one 's instincts and allowing that to override the guidance we 've been given mr warbuton added his father had passed away several weeks ago but neither he nor anyone else was able to be there when he died due to lockdown rules mp peter bone told itv news the vast vast majority of conservative mps think dominic cummings should go what i think is unforgivable is that dominic cummings did n't resign he said mr bone said and then he put the prime minister in a situation where it was either sack him or keep him and in the past an adviser in that situation would have no hesitation but to resign mr bone added that when advisers become the story they go behind the scenes the vast vast majority of conservative mps think dominic cummings should go he said drawing attention to the moral hazard of cummingsgate tory mp george freeman retweeted an article from the spectator which said mr johnsons judgement was now the issue in another tweet mr freeman appeared to bemoan what was missing from the responses of the pm and his main adviser saying today we needed some humility a clear acknowledgement that people would be rightly angry if they sensed double standards a sincere thank you to the millions of people including fathers who have made sacrifices dominic cummings did nt and a public apology from him despite the anger in tory ranks cabinet members have thrown their support behind mr johnson and mr cummings gavin williamson said mr cummings had given a very clear assurance that no rules had been broken no laws have been broken and the prime minister has very clearly taken that assurance and is very much supporting dominic cummings if that 's good enough for the prime minister it 's certainly good enough for me england 's education secretary told itv news he continued the prime minister has asked for assurances about his actions he 's got those assurances he 's been given them by dominic cummings i think the prime minister can ask no more if someone has n't broken the rules and has n't broken the law it 's right that the prime minister has the integrity to stand by them labour leader sir keir starmer tweeted mr johnson had failed a test of leadership saying his decision to take no action against mr cummings was an insult to sacrifices made by the british people while steve reed the shadow communities and local government minister told itv news that mr cummings ' actions had sown huge confusion and called for an inquiry into the facts millions of british people have made extraordinary sacrifices over the last few weeks people have not gone to loved ones ' funerals people have not been able to say goodbye to dying parents even mr reed said people have the right to expect that the guidelines they follow to protect lives are also being followed by the government and the government 's senior advisors the prime minister needs to move swiftly now to re - establish the trust of the british people in their guidelines if they expect them to follow them because what this whole episode over the weekend has done is sown huge confusion people are emailing me to ask whether they do or do n't need to follow the guidance that has to be sorted because lives are at risk the key thing is we need to restore the government 's moral authority to issue guidance that everyone follows because they know the government is following it themselves that does n't appear to be the case with dominic cummings ' trip across the country so what needs to happen now is the prime minister should order an inquiry by the cabinet secretary to establish the actual facts and then in the full light of that knowledge a decision can be taken about whether mr cummings did or did n't breach the rules and what needs to happen as a consequence scottish first minister and snp leader nicola sturgeon said mr cummings should either resign or be sacked pointing out she had had to accept the resignation of scotlands chief medical officer adviser catherine calderwood last month for her own lockdown breach i know it is tough to lose a trusted adviser at the height of crisis but when its a choice of that or integrity of vital public health advice the latter must come first ms sturgeon tweeted that s the judgment i and to her credit catherine calderwood reached pm and cummings should do likewise acting liberal democrat leader ed davey tweeted cummings must go saying the public would be confused and angry that he is still in his position and libdem peer lord rennard called for mr cummings sacking and for his

boris johnson backs dominic cummings over alleged lockdown breaches the government confirmed an investigation has been launched into who posted the unauthorised tweet author jk rowling responded when you find out who it was let us know i want to give them a years salary although the message does not name any individuals it appears to reference prime minister boris johnsons defence of top aide dominic cummings at todays conference responding to claims mr cummings had travelled 260 miles to county durham during the peak of the lockdown mr johnson said he had acted responsibly legally and with integrity references to the daily conference are the top 10 trends on twitter this evening with opposition mps also responding to the speech given by the prime minister boris johnson becomes dominic cummings ' human shield labour leader sir keir starmer tweeted this was a test of the prime minister and he has failed it it is an insult to sacrifices made by the british people that boris johnson has chosen to take no action against dominic cummings the public will be forgiven for thinking there is one rule for the prime ministers closest adviser and another for the british people the prime ministers actions have undermined confidence in his own public health message at this crucial time pm defends top advisor amid lockdown breach allegations millions were watching for answers and they got nothing that s why the cabinet secretary must now launch an urgent inquiry westminster leader for the snp ian blackford who has been vocal in his criticism of mr cummings today said the governments response was a failure of leadership he tweeted boris johnson told us to stay at home and to isolate if we had covid-19 there was no caveat that this does not apply to dominic cummings by supporting cummings at his press conference boris johnson displays a failure of leadership and undermines his own public health messages labour mp jess phillips questioned the claims that mr cummings followed the instincts of every father dominic cummings denies second durham trip she tweeted the instincts of most other fathers in the country was to look after their partner and children at home bad fathering guys david warburton the tory mp for somerton and frome said he was unconvinced by boris johnsons defence of dominic cummings as much as i despise any baying pitchfork led trials by social media i m unconvinced by the pms defence of # cummings he tweeted we ve all been tasked with tempering our parental and other instincts by strictly adhering to govt guidance dominic cummings left number 10 downing street just after 6 pm and gave no response to reporters questions when as he drove away six hours after first arriving the rule of modern politics let 's call it trump 's first law is that if you are being attacked for apparently breaking the rules the best defence is to double down and insist that it is in fact you and your colleagues who have acted with the utmost integrity and anyone who suggests otherwise is a knave or a fool such was how the prime minister defended his chief aide dominic cummings who as i said just now in the daily downing street press conference breached not just one but at least three lockdown rules do n't leave the house if someone in it has covid-19 symptoms do n't spend hours in very close proximity in a confined space like a car with a sufferer and do n't go to a second home the pm said of cummings ' 260 mile car journey from london to durham in travelling to find the right kind of childcare at the moment when both he and his wife were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus and when he had no alternative i think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent and i do not mark him down for that i believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly and legally and with integrity and with the overwhelming aim of stopping the spread of the virus and saving lives in other words far from breaking the rules cummings is an example to us all a hero of the national struggle against the cursed virus whether all the pm 's mp and ministerial colleagues agree with that encomium is not in doubt they do n't but the pm has just become cummings 's human shield which is risky for johnson but means most of cummings 's critics within the tory party will have to pipe down it wo n't stop labour and opposition parties making hay and it may have unfortunate ramifications not least in the words of one former police officer mass appeals against fixed penalty notices for breaching lockdown rules the cummings defence may well enter the lexicon of reasons why someone is not distancing in the way the government and its scientific advisers would hope and expect but the judgement of a number of cabinet members that it 's not if but when cummings is forced out which i reported earlier today has to be revisited even though the norms of conventional politics made their assessment wholly uncontroversial what wo n't be revisited and was reinforced today by the prime minister is that everything important about this government is defined as much by cummings as by johnson pm defends top advisor amid lockdown breach allegations dominic cummings denies second durham trip the high profile figures who have breached lockdown restrictions who is dominic cummings and how did he get to no.10 video report by itv news political correspondent paul brand boris johnson has been accused of risking the governments efforts to combat covid-19 in order to defend his senior aide dominic cummings following allegations he breached lockdown restrictions the prime minister chose to front the daily downing street coronavirus briefing to publicly back mr cummings saying he had acted responsibly legally and with integrity by driving 260 miles to county durham to isolate and that any parent would frankly understand what he did but tory backbenchers tore into mr johnson over his handling of the row while scientists claimed that the defence of mr cummings interpretation of the lockdown rules undermined efforts to curb the spread of covid-19 mr cummings travelled to county durham in march to self isolate with his family while official guidelines warned against long distance journeys apparently because he feared that he and his wife would be left unable to care for their son further reports also suggested he took a second trip to the north east in april having already returned to london following his recovery from coronavirus more than 45,000 people in the uk have die after contracting the virus according to the latest available data mr cummings denied the fresh allegations which were reported by the observer and the sunday mirror and mr johnson declared he would be standing by his most senior adviser has the prime minister 's greatest asset become his greatest liability the prime minister told a downing street press conference i have had extensive face to face conversations with dominic cummings and i have concluded that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare at the moment when both he and his wife were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus and when he had no alternative i think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent and i do not mark him down for that mr johnson added that some of the allegations about mr cummings behaviour during self isolation were palpably false but tory mps criticised the prime ministers actions with former minister paul maynard saying he shared peoples dismay at the response it is a classic case of do as i say not as i do and it is not as if he was unfamiliar with guidance he himself helped draw up it seems to me to be utterly indefensible and his position wholly untenable dominic cummings denies second durham trip tory mp peter bone told itv news mr cummings should have resigned what i think is unforgivable is that dominic cummings did n't resign he said and then he put the prime minister in a situation where it was either sack him or keep him and in the past an adviser in that situation would have no hesitation but to resign mr bone added that when advisers become the story they go behind the scenes the vast vast majority of conservative mps think dominic cummings should go he said who is dominic cummings and how did he get to no.10 a tweet posted from the uk civil service account

psychologist professor stephen reicher one of the scientists on the scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviours spi b said mr johnson had trashed their advice as one of those involved in spi b the government advisory group on behavioural science i can say that in a few short minutes tonight boris johnson has trashed all the advice we have given on how to build trust and secure adherence to the measures necessary to control covid-19 be open and honest we said trashed respect the public we said trashed ensure equity so everyone is treated the same we said trashed be consistent we said trashed make clear we are all in it together trashed it is very hard to provide scientific advice to a government which does nt want to listen to science his views were echoed by colleagues on the spi b group the high profile figures who have breached lockdown restrictions ' labour leader sir keir starmer said mr johnson has treated the british public with contempt by not sacking mr cummings making this the first time labour has called for the chief adviser to go speaking outside his home in north london mr starmer said this was a huge test of the prime minister and he s just failed that test he has nt sacked dominic cummings he has nt called for an investigation and he s treating the british public with contempt millions of people across the country have made the most agonising choices not to visit relatives some of whom were ill dying not to go to funerals they deserve better answers than they got from the prime minister today cummings departure only a matter of time footage posted on

wo nt even entertain me in her garden with a tent the woman who was filming mr cummings on her phone as she spoke could then be heard telling him i m a single parent i ve had no childcare since the beginning of this whole mess not that i can afford to pay any child care another shouted would you recommend barnard castle for a day out mr cummings appeared not to respond to the heckling as he

with our interactive map listen and subscribe to our podcast all the coronavirus information you need in one place from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus born in durham and educated at oxford university dominic cummings rose to notoriety in politics first as an adviser to michael gove and then as campaign director at the official brexit group his role in the stunning victory for that campaign made him a hero to many brexiteers but a hate figure for some remainers the 48-year old has been credited with creating the take back control slogan of the vote leave campaign and criticised over the hotly disputed 350 million nhs claim which was advertised on the side of the brexit bus which travelled the country many will know him as the character played by benedict cumberbatch in the hbo / channel 4 comedy drama film brexit the appointment of the abrasive former campaign director was controversial especially given he had been found to be in contempt of parliament earlier in the year for refusing to give evidence to mps investigating misinformation dominic cummings denies second durham trip he would later say the pledge was necessary to win the campaign group was also fined 61,000 for breaking the rules in the build up to the vote mr cummings is variously seen as a genius a maverick or as a source or ire the accusations that mr cummings broke lockdown rules is certainly not the first time he has caused controversy he was once labelled a career psychopath by former prime minister david cameron according to widely reported remarks but mr cummings is not shy of firing off an insult himself in 2017 he described david davis then the brexit secretary as thick as mince lazy as a toad and vain as narcissus cummings departure only a matter of time the december 2019 election victory gave mr johnson the political capital he needed to take bold decisions and mr cummings soon set to work on his goal of reshaping whitehall issuing a recruitment call for data scientists economists and weirdos and misfits with odd skills to shake up the civil service in april he was back in the headlines when it emerged he had been present at meetings of the official scientific advisory group for emergencies co - ordinating the governments response to the coronavirus pandemic downing street insisted there was nothing untoward about his attendance but opposition mps and some scientists suggested it risked political interference in science based advice from sage mr cummings also drew criticism when he returned to work after his own brush with covid-19 and was pictured allegedly failing to follow the two metre social distancing rules as he walked along downing street flanked by fellow aide cleo watson on april 14 mr cummings ' importance to mr johnson 's government was shown over the weekend in how heavily he was defended by many conservative mps following the allegations that he broke lockdown rules dominic cummings attended meetings of scientific advisory group no10 admits dominic cummings 's role in government no longer looks sustainable as members of the cabinet and tory mps turn against him and in the words of one very senior member of the government it is only a matter of time until the prime minister asks him to go the problem for cummings and the prime minister is summed up in a tweet by the former minister caroline nokes my inbox is rammed with very angry constituents and i do not blame them nokes is typical according to ministers and mps like all prime ministers boris johnson risks deep harm to his own authority and popularity if he ignores what his party is telling him what is very frustrating said one minister is that cummings is only an adviser and yet he is being protected in a way that would never happen to a minister jenrick the housing and communities secretary almost had to resign for doing something much less serious quite how long cummings survives in his job depends mainly ministers think on how many tory mps publicly and privately through the whips call for him to go in the course of today and there is a second ticking time bomb say ministers they fear a member of the public may file a complaint to durham police alleging cummings broke the health protection regulations which the police would be obliged to investigate this is not to presume cummings 's guilt he is completely clear he did not break the law but a criminal investigation would be another embarrassment the decision on whether cummings should stay or go is momentous for the pm cummings is the lynchpin of everything that happens in his administration from the path to full brexit to the end of austerity to the panoply of measures to combat the covid-19 epidemic it is not an overstatement to say that removing cummings would be the equivalent of removing a significant part of the engine of government serious re - engineering would be required of a magnitude that would daunt johnson but for many tory mps and ministers the risk of keeping him is greater because it is a risk to public health there is a widespread perception that the pm 's most important aide bent the quarantine and lockdown rules to suit his own circumstances in an unfair way which would potentially give licence to millions of others to bend life or death rules when the epidemic is a real present and devastating danger we are expecting the police to enforce the rules said a minister but if we are seen to be protecting one of our own our authority is n't what it should be to put all this in a nutshell to keep cummings the prime minister would have to go the full donald trump and marginalise a significant proportion of his own party most who know him say that despite johnsons admiration for trumps campaigning ability he wo nt do that ps there is a last play to keep cummings in post in face of pressure from tory mps for him to go but cummings confident he did nothing wrong which is to ask cabinet secretary to investigate as requested by labour my bet is that s what will happen with everything else going on cabinet secretary sedwill would love that i am sure pressure grows on cummings to go over lockdown breaches dominic cummings has denied he made a second trip to county durham amid the coronavirus lockdown the allegation of a second lockdown breach came after it emerged mr cummings travelled from london to durham in the first week of april with his partner and four year old son after his wife developed coronavirus symptoms and he was self isolating official guidelines warned against long distance travel the pm pledged his full support on saturday to his under fire chief adviser according to the sunday times the conservative party leader told allies he would not throw mr cummings to the dogs following reports he made the journey to ensure his four year old child could be looked after as he and his wife were ill however further allegations surfaced later on saturday that the former vote leave campaign co - ordinator made a second trip to durham and was seen there on april 19 five days after being photographed on his return to westminster a second eyewitness told the the observer and sunday mirror they saw the 48-year old a week earlier in barnard castle on easter sunday a popular tourist location 30 miles away from durham during the period he was believed to be self isolating speaking outside his home on sunday morning when asked if he had returned to durham in mid - april mr cummings said no i did not the denial comes amid a fierce row over the actions of the prime ministers top aide with prominent conservative mps began calling for the adviser to leave his role downing street has said it would not waste time replying to the fresh allegations from campaigning newspapers further pressure was created on sunday morning when steve baker became the first conservative mp to publicly say mr cummings should leave his role mr baker a prominent member of the 1922 committee of backbench tories said mr cummings should resign and should resign now cummings departure only a matter of time who is dominic cummings and how did he get to no.10 the high profile figures who have breached lockdown restrictions ' speaking to itv news mr baker said the row surrounding mr cummings was diverting attention from the stuff that really matters to people like getting out of this lockdown he continued i was surprised that dominic broke the rules because it was such an obvious thing he should have avoided i know that i 'm watched as a member of parliament and therefore i would have expected somebody in dominic 's position to ensure that he complied with the rules absolutely scrupulously so i am flabbergasted there 's no doubt he does turn out good work i 've often said he is capable of being quite brilliant and he 's really i think wrecked his position which is untenable itv news political editor robert peston said mr baker 's calls for mr cummings ' resignation were significant as he and other members of the pro - brexit european research group played a major role in mr johnson becoming prime minister tory mp sir roger gale also described mr cummings ' position as untenable i 've said very publicly as a father and as a grandfather i understand any parent 's desire to protect their children but it 's not good enough for the prime minister 's staff to have one law and everybody else to be asked to obey another sir roger told itv news i think he 's been completely wrong and i think his position is untenable you can not have one law you ca n't say to the public this is what you must do and then do something wholly different yourself that said i understand the right of a parent and the desire of a parent to protect a child i 'd want to do the same but we all have to live by the law and all means mr cummings as well as everybody else damian collins joined the calls for mr cummings to go saying the government would be better off without him another conservative mp simon hoare called on mr cummings to consider his position due to the damage he is doing to the prime minister acting lib dem leader sir ed davey said the pms judgment would be called into question if he did not give mr cummings the chop surely boris johnson must now recognise the actions of his top adviser are an insult to the millions who have made huge personal sacrifices to stop the spread of coronavirus said the former energy secretary transport secretary reveals cummings has pm 's full support as labour calls for urgent inquiry shadow policing minister sarah jones said people are rightly feeling is it one rule for us and one rule for the people at the top as dominic cummings faced more allegations that he broke lockdown rules asked if he should resign she told sky newss sophy ridge on sunday i think what we ve heard in the last 24 hours suggests some quite serious allegations against the pms chief adviser and i think people are feeling rightly angry millions of people have put their lives on hold have made huge sacrifices to obey the rules during this period and we ve seen the heartbreak of people not being able to attend funerals of loved ones not being able to see their family members as they die and i think people are rightly feeling is it one rule for us and one rule for the people at the top and i think there are questions to ask both in terms of what dominic cummings did but also in terms of the response that we saw yesterday where we seemed to get this rowing back of the rules from minister after minister suggesting that nothing had been done incorrectly the snp 's leader in westminster ian blackford wrote on twitter it is clear that boris johnson must sack dominic cummings when the pms top adviser ignores the governments instruction to the public not to engage in non - essential travel he has to leave office immediately transport secretary grant shapps has reiterated that mr cummings stayed put after travelling to durham he told the sophy ridge show i do nt have all the times and dates for you but i understand he will have travelled up there towards the end of march and stayed there remained there for 14 days did nt leave the property and isolation as per the rules and guidance mr shapps said he was sure mr cummings obeyed social distancing rules he said you ll appreciate i was nt with them so i ca nt tell you exactly what that journey was like but what i do know is that dominic cummings i saw a clip yesterday of him asking journalists to be spaced two metres apart so i know he is a stickler for those rules about what to do to make sure you are following the two metre rule and the like so i m sure that they took all the necessary precautions in a statement on saturday morning number 10 said mr cummings had travelled to be close to family to seek help looking after his four year old child after his wife became ill with coronavirus symptoms a virus which has seen more than 45,000 people in the uk die after contracting it according to the latest available data according to the papers 70-year old retired teacher robin lees of barnard castle said he saw mr cummings and his family walking by the river tees near the town he told the mirror and observer i was a bit gobsmacked to see him because i know what he looks like it just beggars belief to think you could actually drive when the advice was stay home save lives it could nt have been clearer the papers also reported that a second unnamed source recalled seeing mr cummings in woodland near his familys durham property on april 19 recognising him due to him wearing his trademark beanie hat responding to the allegations a no 10 spokeswoman said yesterday the mirror and guardian wrote inaccurate stories about mr cummings today they are writing more inaccurate stories including claims that mr cummings returned to durham after returning to work in downing street on 14 april we will not waste our time

march against china 's move to impose national security legislation on the city pro - democracy supporters have sharply criticised a proposal set to be approved by china 's rubber stamp parliament this week that would ban secessionist and subversive activity as well as foreign interference in the semi - autonomous chinese territory the pro - democracy camp says the proposal goes against the one country two systems framework that promises hong kong freedoms not found in mainland china crowds of demonstrators dressed in black gathered in the causeway bay district on sunday chanting slogans such as stand with hong kong liberate hong kong and revolution of our times the protest was a continuation of a months long pro - democracy movement in hong kong that began last year and has at times descended into violence between police and protesters police raised blue flags warning protesters to disperse before firing multiple rounds of tear gas they later fired a water cannon at the demonstrators at least 120 people were arrested mostly on charges of unlawful assembly police said in a facebook post they said in a separate post that protesters threw bricks and splashed unidentified liquid at officers injuring at least four members of the police media liaison team they warned that such behavior is against the law and that police would pursue the matter earlier in the afternoon prominent activist tam tak chi was arrested during the protest for what police said was unauthorised assembly mr tam said he was giving a health talk and was exempt from social distancing

the bill that triggered sunday 's rally was submitted at the opening of chinas national legislative session on friday it would bypass hong kongs legislature and could allow mainland agencies to be set up in the city sparking concern that chinese agents could arbitrarily arrest people for activities deemed to be pro - democracy speaking at an annual news conference during the legislative session chinese foreign minister wang yi said on sunday that hong kong affairs were an internal matter for china and that no external interference will be tolerated excessive unlawful foreign meddling in hong kong affairs has placed chinas national security in serious jeopardy mr wang said adding that the proposed legislation does not affect the high degree of autonomy in hong kong it does not affect the rights and freedoms enjoyed by hong kong residents and it does not affect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors in hong kong he said us secretary of state mike pompeo has called the proposal a death knell for the high degree of autonomy that beijing promised the former british colony when it was returned to china in 1997 chris patten the last british governor of hong kong prior to its handover to china lamented what he called a new chinese dictatorship i think the hong kong people have been betrayed by china which has proved once again that you ca nt trust it further than you can throw it mr patten said in an interview with the times mr patten is leading a coalition of at least 204 international lawmakers and policymakers who are decrying the proposed legislation in a statement the coalition called it a flagrant breach of the sino british joint declaration a 1984 treaty that promised hong kong a high degree of autonomy even after the handover of hong kong to china in 1997 bernard chan a top level hong kong politician and delegate to the national peoples congress in beijing defended the national security legislation pushed by china saying it was written into hong kongs basic law the city 's mini - constitution but never enacted mr chan expressed concern that hong kong would inevitably face economic hardship given trade frictions between the u.s. and china i think we are definitely the collateral damage being dragged into this thing but then i do nt think there s any alternatives he said but with or without this law honestly the us and china are always going to be continuing this loggerhead for quite some time to come mr chan said china will remain as a threat to the us in terms of the world economic dominance by sanjay jha itv news new delhi a new road constructed recently by india connecting kailash mansarovar a sacred hindu buddhist pilgrimage site in tibet has thrown two of the worlds closest neighbours india and nepal into a bitter political and diplomatic feud soon after the indian defence minister inaugurated the new road stretching around 80 km from darchula to lipulekh the tri - junction of the india nepal china borders nepal sharply reacted and said the new road passed through its territory and viewed its construction as an example of bullying by its much larger neighbour india insists that the road falls within its territory and has said it is committed to resolving all outstanding boundary issues through diplomatic dialogue and in the spirit of close and friendly bilateral relations with nepal this clarification from india has not helped much and protests have erupted in nepal over the new road chinese and indian troops exchange blows along sikkim border the friction between the two neighbouring countries comes against the backdrop of india issuing its own new map last november that showed the kalapani region within its own territory nepal protested that time too and india had agreed to talk but it did nt happen nepal felt that that india was not serious about mutually resolving the issue and this has led to anti - india sentiments once again and the indian army chief has commented that nepal may have raised the issue at the behest of someone else hinting at a possible chinese instigation which further infuriated the nepalese leadership india is increasingly worried about chinas rising influence in nepal but instead of doing self introspection it has taken the easy route of blaming nepal friendship is always based on trust not on coercion or covert operations says ashok swain professor of peace and conflict research at swedens uppsala university this border dispute is very old dating back to the 1816 treaty of sugauli which states that all the land that lies east of the mahakali river is part of nepal kathmandus claim over the disputed area lies in the fact that the territories of lipulekh limpiyadhura and kalapani fall south east to the source of mahakali nepal has published a new political map that includes a small stretch of the disputed land toughening its stance on a decades long row over the territory with india the indian officials immediately chided nepal for the publication of a revised map which includes parts of indian territory this unilateral act is not based on historical facts and evidence it is contrary to the bilateral understanding to resolve the outstanding boundary issues through diplomatic dialogue said indian foreign ministry spokesperson anurag srivastava diplomatic analysts say domestic political compulsions have forced nepali prime minister k p oli to take a hardened stand against india at least 72 dead as super cyclone amphan hits india and bangladesh speaking in nepal parliament mr oli said the india virus seems more lethal than chinese or italian he further said that nepal would wrest control of the disputed areas through political and diplomatic initiatives nepal endorsed the indian position for 150 years but now it is raising the stakes due to politics andchina writes s d muni a former indian diplomat in indias leading newspaper the hindustan times prime minister kp oli faces serious internal opposition at the moment including from within his ruling nepal communist party this is largely on account of his governance failures and lack of action on combating the pandemic muni adds analysts say that mr oli is hoping that this face off with india on kalapani will give him a new lease of political life former indian ambassador to nepal rakesh sood says india has been negligent on this issue but why nepal has upped the ante which makes a negative atmosphere for diplomatic dialogue to resolve the outstanding boundary issues notwithstanding this new territorial dispute india and nepal have shared a long history of cooperation and have successfully resolved in the past all territorial ambiguities through diplomatic dialogue durham constabulary has claimed police officers did speak to dominic cummings father following downing street denials there was any contact with his family over his alleged lockdown breaches in a statement in which durham police took the unusual move of naming mr cummings the force said his father contacted them following reports the prime ministers chief aide had travelled 260 miles from his home in london to durham but no 10 had said on saturday morning at no stage was he mr cummings or his family spoken to about this matter as is being reported transport secretary grant shapps also reiterated the government statement was black and white at the daily downing street briefing later in the day however the statement from the force on saturday differed from its previous response over what officers spoke to mr cummings father about the initial response to the allegations on friday said officers explained to mr cummings family the guidelines around self isolation and reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel but saturdays statement said officers provided advice about security issues durham police has not yet clarified what this means and if this is the same as guidelines around self isolation and avoiding non - essential travel the forces updated statement read following a significant number of media inquiries over the weekend durham constabulary can add the following detail on tuesday march 31 our officers were made aware that dominic cummings had travelled from london to durham and was present at an address in the city at the request of mr cummings father an officer made contact the following morning by telephone during that conversation mr cummings father confirmed that his son had travelled with his family from london to the north east and was self isolating in part of the property durham constabulary deemed that no further action was required however the officer did provide advice in relation to security issues it comes amid growing pressure for mr cummings to resign grant shapps said the conversation mr cummings father had with durham constabulary did not relate to his sons travel from london he said i think it was in fact mr cummings father who contacted the police not the other way round and it was in reference to security advice which you ll appreciate the family do nt want to go into not about this specific issue peston why cummings insists he does not need to quit the prime ministers chief aide dominic cummings is under renewed pressure over further new allegations he broke the coronavirus lockdown rules on numerous occasions reports in the mirror and guardian allege mr cummings left

isolating downing street officials defended mr cummingss decision to travel to durham to isolate on a property near his parents home citing childcare reasons after he and his wife had fallen ill ministers had said mr cummings had stayed put after arriving at a property in durham where he had travelled david wood discusses latest allegations about mr cummings transport secretary grant shapps speaking at the daily downing street briefing said mr cummings had stayed put for 14 days while residing at a family property having preempted his own illness once his wife showed covid-19 symptoms but if correct the trip to popular tourist destination barnard castle would call that testimony into question robin lees 70 told the guardian and the mirror he saw mr cummings and his family walking by the tees before getting into a car around lunch time on april 12 he told them i was pretty convinced it was him and it did nt seem right because i assumed he would be in london asked if he thought the prime ministers chief aide should resign he said of course he should you do nt take the virus from one part of the country to another in response to the latest claims in the mirror and observer a

briefing transport secretary grant shapps said mr cummings had the prime ministers full support following initial allegations released on friday that mr cummings broke lockdown rules mr shapps said the prime minister knew that he mr cummings was quite properly staying in place with his family which is the right thing to do mr cummings said he behaved reasonably and legally asked by reporters if his trip to durham during lockdown looked good he said who cares about good looks its a question of doing the right thing its not about what you guys think labour has written to cabinet secretary sir

trams to improve public safety and protect services transport secretary grant shapps said the funding divided into 254 million for buses and 29 million for trams and light rail would increase both frequency and capacity of services while ensuring there is enough space on vehicles to allow for social distancing the money will be spent on making adjustments to vehicles signage deep cleaning and the provision of hand sanitiser dominic cummings says he did the right thing following reports he broke lockdown rules child 12 among latest to die from coronavirus as uk death toll rises by 282 in addition 3,400 people including british transport police officers and network rail staff have been deployed at stations to make sure passengers follow the social distancing guidance put in place light rail funding will also support services in sheffield nottingham tyne and wear manchester and the west midlands a personalised information service has also been introduced to inform people about disruption and crowding on services it comes after the department for transport announced earlier this month that 225 million will go towards creating pop up and permanent cycle lanes across england to encourage people to use bikes instead of public transport when necessary mr shapps said to make sure people can travel safely when they need to we are increasing capacity on buses and light rail as well as helping local authorities fast track plans to support cyclists and pedestrians further reducing pressure on our transport network these measures will help keep passengers safe now but we must also prepare for what comes next strengthening vital road and railway connections as well as encouraging cycling and walking will be essential to our ambition to level up the country secure a green legacy and kickstart regional economies as we build out of covid-19 and look to the future dominic cummings is n't resigning or at least not by choice that much is crystal clear from number 10 's statement that mr cummings believes he behaved reasonably and legally but it is striking that there is no endorsement from boris johnson or the government that it was appropriate to drive 250 miles with a spouse who had covid-19 symptoms rather than quarantining for 14 days in their london home so the debate about whether he should quit will rage for a bit it seems to me the competing arguments are these his defence is that he was doing what all parents would do which is trying to protect his four year old child in the event both parents fell seriously ill with covid-19 by going to a place where his sister could look after his son should the worst happen he drove before the symptoms laid him low and when he got there he stayed in a house separate from his parents who are in their seventies and separate from his sister and my goodness according to the account of how ill he then became given by his spouse mary wakefield in the spectator a month ago he really did then become dangerously unwell the charge against him is that he risked transmitting the dreadful virus to another part of the country by driving so long and far because mary wakefield was already conspicuously unwell with covid-19 symptoms however cummings says that the police have not as reported talked to either him or any member of his family about whether he breached rules with his escape from north london to the north east that said the question of police involvement always looked a slight red herring to me the bigger issue is all about the tension between public and private responsibilities for powerful officials such as cummings many of us would understand why he puts family first and why he is comfortable with what he did especially since much of his self image is of someone who is a permanent foreigner in london but millions of people trapped indoors for weeks will struggle with the idea that he did n't breach the spirit of quarantine and lockdown rules that he did so much to

mr cummings and said the advisor 's trip had been essential to ensure his young child could be properly cared for in a statement number 10 said the prime minister 's aide had stayed in a separate house to his family itv news correspondent david wood on dominic cummings ' defence of his trip from home during lockdown as others call for a clearer answer but labour has called on the government to provide clarity at the daily downing street covid-19 press conference on saturday saying number 10s statement also raises more questions than it answers we are still unclear who knew about this decision and when whether this was sanctioned by the prime minister and whether number 10 is now questioning the validity of the statement from durham police a spokesperson for the labour party said in response to number 10s statement this will cause understandable anger for the millions of people who have sacrificed so much during this crisis the lockdown rules were very clear if you or anyone in your household was suspected of having covid-19 you must immediately self isolate and not leave the house however the prime ministers chief adviser appears to believe that it is one rule for him and another for the british people the high profile figures who have breached lockdown restrictions who are the experts advising the government on how to ease lockdown mum rosie dutton shares her frustration at the dominic cummings allegations at the daily government coronavirus press conference grant shapps defended mr cummingss move to travel from london to durham saying he took a decision to look after his four year old child he also said mr cummings was isolating in a separate property from his parents in durham and stayed in that property with own family referring to the controversy surrounding the pms adviser mr shapps said the steps were taken only to prevent dominic cummings child being without the necessary support he added mr cummings is in the public eye but the reality of the matter is that a four year old childs welfare was the important thing parents ask themselves what they would do if they had if they no one else around and eventually you would have to turn to external support or try and be close enough to your family to provide that care which is what happened in this case here the transport secretary was asked if the prime minister knew if mr cummings was isolating in durham he told reporters the important thing is that everyone remains in the same place whilst they are on lockdown which is exactly what happened in i think the case you re referring to with mr cummings the prime minister will have known he was staying put and he did nt come out again until he was feeling better mr shapps added the guidance says if you re living with children keep following this advice to the best of your ability however we are aware that not all these measures will be possible depending therefore on circumstances he continued in other words if you are in a position where you ve got a young child in this case four years old and you are worried about the welfare of that child and your ability to throw around them the wider network of support then clearly being somewhere where other members of the family can assist by which i mean in this case younger other members of the family then that might be the best place for you to settle and stay throughout the time that you re ill and i think that s all that s happened in this case sir ed davey acting leader of the liberal democrats has called for mr cummings to quit over the allegations if dominic

kong a law to be introduced by the chinese government which will give china greater powers to prevent and punish any form of dissent in the autonomous region the national security legislation was announced on the opening day of the delayed annual gathering of the communist party in china it is expected to be rubber stamped next week without any debate or due process in hong kong it is the most audacious move yet by beijing and viewed as a further erosion of hong kong autonomy the handover agreement signed in 1997 was meant to guarantee one country two systems until 2047 the agreement allows hong kong to enjoy freedoms not permitted on the mainland demonstrations triggered by an extradition bill have gripped hong kong for the past year becoming increasingly lawless and violent protesters feared the day china would bring in its troops as they resort to force and now that has come in the form of this legislation hong kong opposition condemns china 's security law move the national security laws give beijing the legal justification to act directly and quash the protests it criminalises any act of treason secession sedition or subversion of the chinese people 's government and it seeks to prevent foreign political organisations or bodies from conducting business in hong kong one of the most ominous parts of the new law will allow chinese security services to operate on the streets of hong kong establishing a presence in the city pro - democracy lawmakers have been quick to round on the announcement calling it a bleak and sad day for hong kong lamenting dark days are coming they claim beijing is treating hong kong like an unruly teenager and demanding obedience the lawmakers agree that this announcement by beijing will in the short term at least inflame the protests there are already gatherings being planned for the weekend and next week when this new law is expected to pass to make matters worse it is now going to coincide with a bill currently going through the hong kong legislative council which seeks to make disrespecting the chinese national anthem a crime punishable with up to three years in jail one of hong kong 's most prominent pro - democracy campaigners joshua wong has told itv news that this is no time to surrender and their fight will go on he has already been arrested and imprisoned several times for his part in demonstrations but says he is prepared to do so again to preserve hong kong 's freedoms human trials to start after coronavirus antibody tests carried out on mice reporting of the law in chinese state media is quite different it has been described as an opportunity to put an end to the turmoil adding an extra layer of protection which will maintain the one country two systems an editorial in the global times claimed pro - democracy lawmakers have poised the citys atmosphere and blamed a warped sense of right and wrong for the violence after returning from beijing on friday night hong kong chief executive carrie lam held a press conference during which she gave her full support to the law even though it undermines her authority president xi jinping emboldened by his victory over the virus is seeking to further consolidate his leadership and show hong kong that he will no longer tolerate any trouble the pandemic has presented xi with the toughest set of economic and political challenges the country has faced since it reformed at the end of the 1970s under such pressure and attack from the united states in particular he has moved to shore up his domestic position he appears to be running out of patience with the one country two systems and making move to hasten the day he takes full control of hong kong video report by itv news correspondent martha fairlie the home secretary priti patel has announced plans to quarantine international travellers for 14 days as she leads the daily government covid-19 briefing the plans mean people arriving in the uk from june 8 with have to self isolate for 14 days although certain workers will be exempt people face spot checks and 1,000 fines for breaching the self isolation terms under the measures aimed at guarding against a second wave of coronavirus in the uk road hauliers and medical officials will be exempted while the common travel area with ireland will be unaffected arrivals from france will largely not be exempt officials have already confirmed following confusion earlier this week although there are some exceptions how will new quarantine measures affect travellers to uk ryanair boss michael oleary slams governments ' idiotic quarantine plans extra trains running for first full working week after lockdown eased in england travellers will be asked to fill in a form with their contact information and health officials will perform spot checks to ensure compliance with the measures many countries imposed quarantine rules at the beginning of pandemic but the home secretary said now was the most effective time to implement them she told the daily downing street press conference the answer as to why were bringing in these measures now is simple it is to protect that hard won progress and prevent a devastating resurgence in a second wave of the virus ms patel said that passenger arrivals have been down 99 % compared to the previous year but now the peak has passed steps to guard against imported cases must be imposed paul lincoln border force director general said spot checks would be carried out on the accuracy of quarantine forms of those arriving into the uk from abroad he said the border force expected most people to comply with the measures but the agency was ready to act in cases where the rules were not followed any obvious errors will trigger a requirement for the passenger to complete another form or potentially be refused entry into the uk he said given the high levels of compliance to date we expect the vast majority of people will take this seriously and do the right thing mr lincoln added we will however take enforcement action against a small minority of people who may disregard these actions and therefore further endanger peoples lives the home secretary said all but essential travel was still advised against by the uk government insisting that the move did not equate to britain shutting its borders we are not shutting down completely we are not closing our borders people need to recognise that what we are seeking to do is control the spread of the virus because we do not want a second wave of this virus the move has angered some airlines and trade bodies who claim they have not been given specific discussions as yet on how a quarantine would be implemented a virgin atlantic spokesperson said the measures will prevent flights from resuming echoing an earlier warning from airlines uk that a quarantine would effectively kill international travel to and from britain ryanair boss michael oleary earlier this week branded the plan idiotic and unimplementable tim alderslade chief executive of airlines uk said in a statement rather than this blanket measure we believe the answer lies in government taking a more targeted risk based approach as happens with aviation security standards today the transport secretary referenced the concept of air bridges in parliament this week a measure that would enable travel between countries which share commonality in country wide health measures screening standards in travel and/or low rates of transmission this proposal must be seen as a crucial step in the right direction the home secretary said ministers will work to find new ways to reopen international travel and tourism in a safe and responsible way we also recognise how hard these changes will be for our travel sector and leisure sectors who are already struggling through these unprecedented times she said so across government we will continue to work with them and support what is an incredibly dynamic sector to find new ways to reopen international travel and tourism in a safe and responsible way ms patel also confirmed the plan will be reviewed every three weeks tributes have poured in for a man who served under 11 presidents in the white house who died after contracting covid-19 wilson jerman started working as a cleaner under president dwight eisenhower and retired as an elevator operator during the presidency of barack obama he died aged 91 with his kindness and care wilson jerman helped make the white house a home for decades of first families including ours said former first lady michelle obama joe biden deflects questions on trump allegations white house staff ordered to wear masks in west wing the brutal digital 2020 presidential campaign has begun his service to others his willingness to go above and beyond for the country he loved and all those whose lives he touched is a legacy worthy of his generous spirit jerman became a white house butler under president john kennedy a role that mrs. kennedy was instrumental in landing for him his oldest granddaughter jamila garrett told the local fox news station in washington jerman served as a white house butler across 11 presidencies and made generations of first families feel at home including ours tweeted hillary clinton our warmest condolences to his loved ones former president george w. bush and first lady laura bush said jerman was a lovely man he was the first person we saw in the morning when we left the residence and the last person we saw each night when we returned the bushes said in a statement to nbc news desiree barnes who worked in the obama administration said jerman treated the staff kindly she recalled that when she worked as an intern he would get her a meal if she had not eaten and that he even called her during a particularly rough snowstorm to make sure she was okay it did not matter which political party he was there to serve barnes said he had been there on some of the hardest days for a lot of presidents imagine being there when president kennedy was assassinated and having to receive the first lady at the time so he was a really empathetic man he just was a great

office and the department for health and social care to remove health and care workers from the surcharge as soon as possible full details will be announced in the coming days a number 10 spokesman said covid-19 death toll in uk increases by 338 bringing total to 36,042 free coronavirus antibody tests to be available for people who need them mr johnson has been thinking about this a great deal and as a personal beneficiary of carers from abroad he understands the difficulties faced by our amazing nhs staff the spokesman said the purpose of the nhs surcharge is to benefit the nhs help to care for the sick and save lives nhs and care workers from abroad who are granted visas are doing this already by the fantastic contribution which they make the 400 surcharge remains in place for other categories of visa applicants and will increase to 624 in october as planned the change will apply to all nhs workers ranging from medical health staff to vital porters and cleaners itv news political editor robert peston analyses the u - turn it also includes independent health workers and social care workers the u - turn comes a day after labour leader sir keir starmer criticised mr johnson 's previous policy during prime minister 's questions many of them are risking their lives for us sir keir said does the pm think it is right mr johnson admitted that some of that nhs frankly saved my life but continued to defend the policy we must look at the realities mr johnson said this is a a great national service it 's a national institution it needs funding and those contributions actually help us to raise about 900 million it 's very difficult in the current circumstances to find alternative sources however mr johnson has now seen fit to change his mind having faced strong opposition from members of his own side too pmqs abandoning track and trace left huge hole in our defences says keir starmer senior tories demanded change with former party chairman lord patten calling it appalling and monstrous former conservative party vice chairman sir roger gale warned mr johnson that not to waive the current surcharge would rightly be perceived as mean spirited doctrinaire and petty public administration and constitutional affairs committee chairman william wragg called for an immediate change in policy adding now is the time for a generosity of spirit towards those who have done so much good labour leader sir keir said boris johnson is right to have u turned and backed our proposal to remove the nhs charge for health professionals and care workers this is a victory for common decency and the right thing to do we can not clap our carers one day and then charge them to use our nhs the next following the announcement on thursday afternoon mr johnson joined the weekly clap for our carers to celebrate nhs workers another of those on their doorstep was nurse eva omondi from kenya who last month told itv news it would cost her family 11,000 to pay the surcharge ms omondi was needless to say very relieved by the news that she will not need to stump up the fee from now on coronavirus everything you need to know check the number of cases in your area with our interactive map listen and subscribe to our podcast all the coronavirus information you need in one place from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus at least 5 % of people in the uk have had coronavirus the results of an antibody surveillance study suggests while around 17 % of londoners are believed to have caught it health secretary matt hancock speaking at the government 's daily coronavirus update said the result is based on a sample and that antibody tests are needed at a larger scale before the public can know whether they 've had covid-19 as such he said the government had reached a deal on the supply of 10 million commercial antibody tests which will be rolled out in a phased way from next week the tests which reveal whether a person has had covid-19 by checking if they have coronavirus antibodies will be free for people who need them and priority will be given to nhs staff and care workers mr hancock warned however were not yet in a position to say that those who test positive in these antibody tests are immune from coronavirus covid-19 death toll in uk increases by 338 bringing total to 36,042 uk health workers to take trump 's hydroxychloroquine in trial but he said insights these antibody tests provide will be crucial as understanding of the virus grows they can help us to understand how our bodies react to coronavirus and how its spread across the country the deal which was reached following negotiations between the government and pharmaceutical firms roche and abbot mr hancock said devolved administrations of wales scotland and northern ireland will decide how to use their test allocation ministers are also awaiting results of a trail being carried out from today which if successful will mean tests can show whether a person currently has coronavirus within 20 minutes up to 4,000 people of all ages and backgrounds will participate in the pilot which will run for up to six weeks itv news correspondent paul davies gives an update on the lockdown it will be led by hampshire hospitals nhs trust and trained health professionals will take a swab and process the results on site mr hancock said it does nt need to be sent to a lab to be processed and so you get the result on the spot typically within around 20 minutes its already proven effective in early trials and we want to find out if it will be effective on a larger scale well monitor its effectiveness very closely and if it works well roll it out as soon as we can the health secretary says an effective testing regime will be our guiding star as the uk moves further out of lockdown its the information that helps us to search out and defeat this virus he added the uk is working to further ramp up its testing capabilities so that a system of test and trace can be implemented to track where coronavirus is in the country prime minister boris johnson has announced the system will be up and running by june 1 the day earmarked for the gradual reopening of schools and non - essential retail shops in england he said 25,000 contact tracers made up of call handlers and medical professionals will be hired by the start of june to trace contacts by emailing and phoning contacts of coronavirus patients he said the staff will be able to trace up to 10,000 contacts a day mr hancock sought to play down the importance of an nhs contact tracing app being trailed on the isle of wight which was said to be integral to the uk 's tracing system he told the downing street press conference the technology is an important part but it is not the only part he said trials of the app in the isle of wight had shown the human contact tracing elements were also important so people can understand the consequences of what is required if they have been near someone with coronavirus the app is as you know working in the isle of wight we want to make sure that this whole system lands well and supports the ability safely to make changes to social distancing rules mr hancock said it was earlier revealed at least 36,042 people have died with coronavirus an increase of 338 from yesterday according to the latest figures from the department of health minutes before the press conference began a downing street spokesman announced overseas health and care staff will be exempt from the fee levied on migrants to pay for use of the nhs downing street said prime minister johnson has asked officials at the home office and the department for health and social care to remove health and care workers from the surcharge as soon as possible boris johnson will not face a iopc investigation into his links with american businesswoman jennifer arcuri while he was mayor of london but a probe by the london assembly will resume a review found there was a close association between the two and there may have been an intimate relationship but there were no grounds for criminal investigation the independent office for police conduct said the prime minister was accused of showing ms arcuri favouritism by giving her 126,000 in public funding and privileged access to foreign trade missions while he was in city hall between 2008 and 2016 the independent office for police conduct iopc had been considering whether mr johnson should be investigated for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office mr johnson 's spokesman said the review was a waste of police time and welcomed the fact that this politically motivated complaint has been thrown out such vexatious claims of impropriety in office were untrue and unfounded the spokesman added an investigation by the london assembly oversight committee over mr johnson 's links with ms arcuri was paused in october 2019 following a request from the police watchdog but that will now resume len duvall the greater london authoritys gla oversight committee chair said the iopc was looking specifically at whether he committed a criminal offence that s not our remit and their decision does nt have any real bearing on our investigation which will focus on his conduct as mayor of london he added our investigation will consider whether boris johnson conducted himself in a way that s expected from anyone in that position mr johnson has always denied allegations against him and around the time allegations were first made he said everything was done in accordance with the code and everything was done with full propriety opponents of mr johnson say he should have declared an interest relating to his links with ms arcuri after reports said the pair had an affair in september 2019 he told the bbc there was no interest to declare adding let 's be absolutely clear i am very very proud of everything that we did and certainly everything that i did as mayor of london in october the government internal audit agency ruled a 100,000 grant awarded to the former model was appropriate the iopc said there is no evidence that mr johnson influenced the payment of sponsorship monies to ms arcuri or her firms it also found no evidence to show mr johnson sought to influence or played an active part in securing ms arcuris participation in trade missions there is however some evidence that mr johnson may have been aware that ms arcuri was on an attendee list for a new york trade mission event even though he disputed it ms arcuri has also denied being shown favouritism claiming in october that she was being used as collateral all the allegations are false she added i had every right to be on those trips as a legitimate businesswoman and stand by everything that happened because these allegations are completely false jennifer arcuri boris johnson cast me aside as if i were a gremlin lorraine kelly lays into jennifer arcuri after good morning britain interview 100,000 grant awarded to us businesswoman jennifer arcuri was appropriate someone has gone to great lengths to put together a massive attack and i stand by the legitimacy of my business i am in fact a legitimate businesswoman in an interview with lbc radio in october the pm suggested stories about him and ms arcuri had come to light because of the governments stance on brexit there are quite a lot of well meaning and highly intelligent people who basically think that that would be something they do nt want to see and i think that there is a concerted effort now to frustrate brexit he said mr duval said everyone who holds public office whether you re the mayor of london or indeed the prime minister is expected to adhere to the principles of public life including integrity selflessness openness and honesty to name a few a simple and compelling point made on peston by former who director anthony costello last night the uk already has a potentially world class network for track and trace in its gp surgeries but these are being sidelined as outsourcing giants serco and sitel have been hired to organise clinical and non clinical people to sit at the end of a phone to have conversations with symptom sufferers to get them tested trace who they ve been with and presumably monitor their progress according to costello gps are not even allowed to order a covid-19 test for patients those patients have to do it for themselves now it may be that the risk was thought to be too high for gps that all their other primary care responsibilities would fall by the wayside if they became the port of call for coronavirus sufferers or maybe the risk of contagion in the surgeries was too high though gp surgeries are just as able to do a phone or online consultation as anyone else but this inability from the start of the epidemic to use gps in any way for the most urgent primary care issue of our age does increasingly seem odd and is arguably yet another manifestation of the harm done over many years in eliminating any spare capacity from the nhs when this is all over increasing the fundamental resilience to shocks of the nhs will surely be an

speed during the covid-19 pandemic speaking on itv 's peston show the british paediatrician said we can make comparisons between the european countries and america and the asian countries that clearly acted faster than us because clearly we did n't act at speed when asked whether testing in the community has been a disaster mr costello said it 's not just about testing numbers since day one the who the policy has been to find test trace and isolate and the isolate seems to be forgotten about the key finding is that you have to do all of this at speed he added why did n't the government protect us earlier from coronavirus contact tracing what does it do why is it crucial and can i be recruited mr costello added that the uk has appeared to have totally bypass our primary care system he said if i got symptoms tomorrow i would want to call or email my gp my gp knows my history my underlying health condition and they would be able to reassure to test you he added one thing i have learnt this week and astonishingly gps are n't allowed to ask for a test so we 're bypassing the sustainable system that would call us and recall us when there is a problem and when they are worried conservative mp for south northamptonshire andrea leadsom said she welcomes leader of the house jacob rees mogg 's decision for mps to return to parliament by june 2 we need to do our jobs the government needs us we are workers too and we need to be setting a good example she said she added that the the business of government particularly the scrutiny of legislation and government needs to happen she also confirmed that mps who may be vulnerable or unable to come in can continue to work from home as people will not be forced to come in but added that for those others of us that feel we can come we will when asked about the government 's decision to extend its bereavement scheme to all nhs support staff and carers she said priti is a really decent kind woman she really is i do n't know why that was n't there yesterday but it is there today as soon as she will have come become aware of it i 'm quite certain she would 've wanted to extend that to all carers and overseas staff she added former foreign secretary and chief executive officer of the international rescue committee david milliband also agreed with ms leadsom saying the heart of the cheques and balances is effective accountability is key in government when asked about how well sir keir starmer is doing as the labour leader he said he 's doing really well he 's made me proud to be labour again the years in which we were unelectable in which our promises could be turned into reality have been put to one side i think keir would say it 's a very long road back from labour 's worst result since 1935 but he 's brought back clarity pride principle to the work of opposition on the return of football former england manager sam allardyce said money is a factor for premier league clubs returning but he said the biggest concern is for the lower leagues he added that it will be interesting to see how many will get infected from going back to their training when asked about how risky it is for players returning mr allardyce said eventually they will have to come back 11 vs 11 and then they will have to see what testing is saying then it is a big worry now but they must take each step at a time and hopefully we 'll see the premier league he said that that players will not be forced to play i can assure you that they will be able to opt out one of the bigger problems is the players running out of contracts will they want to put themselves at risk if their contract is running out the return of football will also affect the quality of the game the former england manager said it will affect the quality of

disparity in regional infection rates oliver dowden speaking at the daily coronavirus press conference said the government 's clear intention is that we move as a whole country on the reopening of schools the government hopes reception year 1 and year 6 pupils can return to primary schools as early as june 1 if evidence shows it 's safe to do so mr dowden responding to a question from itv news political editor robert peston said if a track and trace system identifies very micro hotspots of coronavirus infections then lockdown measures might be imposed on schools at local levels abandoning track and trace left huge hole in our defences ' how will the coronavirus contact tracing app work it is best thoughthat we move as a whole nation and that would include the whole of england in doing so he said the culture secretary also confirmed 35,704 people had died in hospitals care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the uk as of 5 pm on tuesday he said that represents an increase of 363 from 35,341 the day before in the 24-hour period up to 9 am on wednesday 177,216 tests were carried out or dispatched mr dowden said his comment comes just hours after his cabinet colleague robert buckland said there may not be a uniform approach in the reopening of schools mr dowden said a lot of work has been done to ensure schools can reopen safely schools should reopen as soon as safe to do so doctors union says he said ministers have considered infection mitigating strategies such as staggering entry times and keeping children together in groups of 15 the reason for doing all of that he said is because i think there s very strong evidence particularly for the most disadvantaged children in those early years its not cost free for them not going to school several councils across the country have voiced concerns over schools reopening in june on tuesday calderdale council in west yorkshire advised its schools against wider reopening following similar moves from bury liverpool and hartlepool test to show if you have had coronavirus on sale at superdrug rolls royce to cut 9,000 jobs as demand slumps amid pandemic a number of the 153 english local authorities have acknowledged safety concerns but have not urged all their schools to reject the proposed timeframe a slide shown at the government coronavirus briefing showed huge disparity in the number of people in hospital with coronavirus in different region of the uk and it has been reported the r number rate of infection in southern regions is around 0.5 while the number in some northern regions could be as high as 0.9 a poll from teachers union nasuwt suggested that only 5 % of teachers think it will be safe for more pupils to return to school next month general secretary patrick roach said the union remains unconvinced that wider reopening of schools from june 1 is appropriate or practicable mps should return to parliament by june 2 the leader of the house of commons has said despite social distancing concerns rising from how crowded the chamber usually is jacob rees mogg believes mps should move inline with the government 's ambition to move to phase two of lockdown relaxation which ministers hope will see some children back in school as early as june 1 he said hybrid parliamentary proceedings which involve most mps contributing via video link do not provide sufficient scrutiny of policy matters under the hybrid proceedings the time this house is able to spend debating legislation faces being cut by around two thirds he said we have to recognise that if we persist with the present arrangement it will become harder to make progress in a timely fashion that is why in line with government advice for those who can not do their jobs from home i am asking members to return to their place of work after whitsun captain tom moore overawed by news he will be knighted third of patients to die with covid had diabetes nhs england a spokesman for labour leader sir keir starmer said mps and their staff should be allowed to continue to work from home after the whitsun recess which ends on june 2 he said labour 's priority is about the safety and wellbeing of staff as such the party and others in opposition tabled an amendment to continue the hybrid virtual arrangement after the whitsun recess to keep the current arrangement in place the amendment failed paving the way for mps to return to parliament parliament has developed a successful system using technology to ensure the scrutiny of government while allowing people to work remotely added the spokesman the government has yet to provide an honest explanation as to why they want to bring this virtual system to an end mr rees mogg responded to a suggestion that a return was planned to bolster support for mr johnson at pmqs saying it is a fundamentally trivial one and he would ignore it adding the chambers return will be in line with government advice in an attempt to allay fears over social distancing mr rees mogg said mps will not be returning to the crowded bustling chamber of old we will be observing social distancing he made a previous impassioned speech in the commons last week making the same points he said he was reassured on tuesday by the progress being made in ensuring the parliamentary estate is a covid-19 secure workplace and that mps staff will be strongly advised to continue working from home mr rees mogg told mps only yesterday mr speaker you organised a test of a new system for divisions that will ensure members can vote whilst remaining six feet apart he added i would finally like to reassure those members with underlying health conditions who have been told to shield or are receiving specific government advice about their health we are working with the house authorities to see how they can continue to contribute to proceedings within the house he did not answer whether mps and parliamentary staff would have access to tests and masks when they return after recess he indicated the commons may use a roll call system of voting once the digital hybrid proceedings end podcast do i have to send my children back to school what

starmer has claimed the government 's decision to abandon covid-19 contact tracing early on in the coronavirus crisis left a huge hole in the uk 's defences at a tense and combative pmqs the labour leader levelled stinging criticism at boris johnson saying for nearly ten weeks in a critical period the uk has been without effective tracing he compared the uk 's death toll of at least 35,000 where there is no tracking and tracing in place to that of germany and south korea around 8,000 and 300 deaths respectively which both implemented tracing early on responding the prime minister claimed vast progress was being made on tracking and tracing and said he had great confidence that by june 1 a system would be in place he said the government will have recruited 25,000 staff capable of tracing the contacts of up to 10,000 new covid-19 cases a day by june schools should reopen as soon as safe to do so doctors union says rolls royce to cut 9,000 jobs as demand slumps amid pandemic jobs site crashes after minister urges public to pick for britain sir keir said there is no getting away from the decision on march 12 when tracing was abandoned prime minister johnson was visibly rattled by sir keir 's line of questioning saying it was peculiar for the labour leader to ask about testing and tracing saying he is perfectly aware of the situation he said sir keir 's feigned ignorance does n't come off very well as he announced the time table for the test and trace operation the pm also announced at least 181 nhs staff had died during the crisis and 131 social care workers sir keir criticised the government 's record on care homes with more than 10,000 care home residents dead he questioned a claim made by the health secretary that a protective ring was thrown around care homes from start he said that claim was flatly contradicted by the chief executive of care england on tuesday sir keir quoting professor martin green said we should have been focusing on care homes from the start despite what is being said there were cases of people who did nt have a covid status or were symptomatic who were discharged into our care homes the government advice to hospitals from the april 2 to april 15 was negative tests are not required prior to transfers / admissions into the care home what s protective about that sir keir asked the prime minister mr johnson said his opposite number was right to draw attention to what has happened in our care homes but added no one was discharged into a care home this year without the express authorisation of a clinician the pm claimed sir keir was in ignorance of the facts around coronavirus testing in care homes after the labour leader cited a government command paper which said every care home for the over 65s will have been offered testing for residents and staff by the 6th of june that s over two weeks away sir keir said as he asked what s causing the continued delay in routine testing in our care homes mr johnson responded we are absolutely confident that we will be able to increase testing we will get up to 200,000 tests in this country by the end of this month this county is testing more than virtually any other county in europe meanwhile commons speaker lindsay hoyle told health secretary matt hancock off for heckling the opposite bench in the commons chamber saying he would be more than happy for him to leave and be replaced with someone else a senior minister has appeared to row back on claims the government had a binary choice on whether to prioritise the nhs over care homes with coronavirus testing just hours after admitting the choice had been to focus on the nhs robert buckland told itv news it was a false dichotomy to suggest a choice was made between the two but in an earlier interview he said to sky news ministers needed to make a choice about testing and we did decide to focus upon the nhs labour shadow care minister liz kendal says mr buckland 's comments are the clearest admission yet that ministers did n't give care homes the protection they needed the government is being heavily criticised over how care homes have been protected from covid-19 during the crisis with many believing elderly coronavirus patients were sent from hospitals back into care homes housing clinically vulnerable residents government critics cite official hospital guidance from before april 15 which said negative tests are not required prior to transfers / admissions into the care home rolls royce to cut 9,000 jobs as demand slumps amid pandemic at tuesday evening 's coronavirus press conference cabinet minister george eustice admitted there may have been some instances where patients without symptoms were moved untested into care homes with at least 10,000 care home residents dying with coronavirus since the crisis began some are claiming this policy was a contributing factor to the rising death toll the government has said almost four in ten covid-19 deaths in england have occurred in care homes earlier on wednesday mr buckland said we ve seen a great tragedy in our care homes which is a matter of huge regret asked on sky news whether nhs had been put first and foremost at the start of the covid-19 outbreak he said that s right and i think that was absolutely essential third of patients to die with covid had diabetes nhs england captain tom moore overawed by news he will be knighted now is not time to blame people i think that would be wholly counterproductive however when he spoke to itv news later in the morning mr buckland appeared to u - turn on this saying it was not a binary choice but labour 's ms kendal said social care and the nhs are equally important in the fight against the virus and are inextricably linked one can not be prioritised above the other mr buckland said he recognised there had been far too many cases of infection and death in care homes but added i think every country in the world will look back and say there were things we could have done differently but i think now we ve got to focus on the here and now coronavirus everything you need to know check the number of cases in your area with our interactive map listen and subscribe to our podcast all the coronavirus information you need in one place from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus a government website advertising seasonal fruit picking jobs for british workers was unavailable just moments after the environment secretary urged people to visit it the website pick for britain which george eustice said contained fruit picking job adverts showed the message the service is unavailable mr eustice said british workers particularly those who are furloughed should visit the website in order to help bring that harvest home because only about a third of the normal fruit picking workforce is available this year the department for environment food & rural affairs said it was aware of the issue and was working to rectify it it comes amid a shortage of foreign workers in the uk which even prompted prince charles to call for a second world war style army of workers to prevent britains crops going to waste sunak warns of severe recession the likes of which we 've not seen britain needs a new army of food pickers says prince charles the prince says the coronavirus crisis has taught us all that food is precious and valued and that it should not be taken for granted he said if we are to harvest british fruit and vegetables this year we need an army of people to help the uks agricultural sector is concerned that tonnes of the countrys fruit and vegetable crops could be left rotting in the fields unless more people come forward to find work migrant labour is hugely restricted this year because of the travel restrictions imposed around the world to prevent the spread of the virus compared to previous years there are currently much fewer people in the uk from countries such as romania and bulgaria which usually take part in the harvest mr eustice said only about a third of the people who would normally come are already here and small numbers may continue to travel but one thing is clear and that is that this year we will need to rely on british workers to lend a hand to help bring that harvest home he suggested furloughed workers may be getting to the point that they want to lend a hand and play their part they may be wanting to get out and they may be wanting to supplement their income anyone feeling that way he said should visit the pick for britain website which enables people to go online and check what jobs are available a previous plea for britons to join the fruit picking work force saw just 112 people take up roles out of 50,000 applications according to the daily telegraph he also gave an update on the uk 's official coronavirus death toll which is now at least 35,341 an increase of 545 from the day before in the 24-hour period up to 9 am on tuesday 89,784 tests were carried out or dispatched he added professor dame angela mclean deputy chief scientific adviser said there was a sustained decline across all four of our nations in the numbers of covid-19 hospital patients requiring mechanical ventilation a marker of those who have been worst affected after contracting the virus talking viewers through the presentation slides at the daily downing street briefing dame angela also said there was a continued steady decline in the number of coronavirus associated deaths demonstrated in the published data the latest update from the government follows a warning from chancellor rishi sunak that the uk will likely face a severe recession the likes of which we have not seen mr sunak giving evidence to the house of lords economic affairs committee said lockdown is having a very significant impact on our economy despite the unprecedented mitigating actions imposed to protect the economy just getting in a chair is hard one man 's coronavirus recovery more than 44,000 coronavirus related deaths in uk he said even as the sections of society are released from lockdown it is not obvious that there will be an immediate bounce back from the economy earlier ministers were accused of being too slow to protect care homes from coronavirus after figures from the ons showed the uk 's death toll had exceeded 44,000 it is not clear exactly what mr eustice will give an update on however he earlier told the commons he is hopeful pubs will able to reopen in july he 's likely to be quizzed on the issue by journalists at the press conference video report by itv news economics editor joel hills the uk is likely to face a severe recession the likes of which we have not seen due to the coronavirus lockdown the chancellor has warned rishi sunak giving evidence to the house of lords economic affairs committee said lockdown is having a very significant impact on our economy despite the unprecedented mitigating actions imposed to protect the economy several measures have been introduced to shield public services jobs and firms from impacts of lockdown such as the furlough scheme but the chancellor said he certainly wo n't be able to protect every job and every business were already seeing that in the data and no doubt there will be more hardship to come even as the sections of society are released from lockdown mr sunak warned it is not obvious that there will be an immediate bounce back from the economy employment drops sharply in april despite government support there is self evidently going to be a recession as gdp plummets we all would hope that it is as swift and strong as it can be he said but data from around the world suggests a bounce back will not be quick if we can re - open retail which i would very much like to be able to do on 1 june there will still be restrictions on how people can shop which will have an impact likely on how much they spend he said and those things will all take time so i think in all cases it will take a little bit of time for things to get back to normal even once we ve re - opened currently closed sectors mr sunak said the longer a recession goes on the more chance there will be of scarring lasting damage to the economy and people 's wages the longer the recession the likelihood the degree of scarring is higher he said on may 14 itv news business and economics editor joel hills said there is self evidently going to be a recession joel hills speaks to presenter tom bradby on itv 's news at ten more than eight million jobs have been furloughed so far and 1.1 million people have

unproven for fighting covid-19 the president told reporters he has been taking hydroxychloroquine and a zinc supplement daily for about a week and a half now mr trump spent weeks pushing the drug as a potential cure for covid-19 against the advice of many of his administration 's top medical professionals the drug has the potential to cause significant side effects in some patients and has not been shown to combat coronavirus itv news washington correspondent robert moore analyses donald trump 's latest actions mr trump said his doctor did not recommend the drug to him but he requested it from the white house physician i started taking it because i think it 's good he said i 've heard a lot of good stories he dismissed reports of side effects saying all i can tell you is so far i seem to be ok mr trump has repeatedly pushed the anti - malarial with or without the antibiotic azithromycin but no large rigorous studies have found them safe or effective for preventing or treating covid-19 they can cause heart rhythm problems and other side effects the us 's food and drug administration has warned against the drug combo and said hydroxychloroquine should only be used for coronavirus in formal studies two large observational studies each involving around 1,400 patients in new york recently found no benefit from hydroxychloroquine two new ones published on thursday in the medical journal bmj reached the same conclusion donald trump labels coronavirus the plague from china ' coronavirus which vaccines and treatments are being trialled barack obama criticises trump 's administration 's covid-19 response one by french researchers gave 84 hospital patients the drug and 97 others the usual care there were no differences in the odds of death need for intensive care or developing severe illness the other study from china was a stricter test 150 adults in hospital with mild or moderate illness were randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine or usual care the drug made no difference in rates of clearing the virus or time to relief of symptoms and they brought more side effects in april the national institutes of health launched a study testing hydroxychloroquine versus a placebo drug in 500 covid-19 patients last week nih announced another study to see if hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin can prevent hospital admission or death in people with mild to moderate illness about 2,000 us adults with confirmed coronavirus infections and symptoms such as fever cough or shortness of breath will receive the drugs or placebo pills coronavirus

when schools may open and the lockdown in wales tessa asks would it be acceptable for me to drive my son to england from wales to see his daughter it really depends on how far you have to drive if you happen to live near the border and you need to go into england i guess that would be acceptable if you 're living in the far west of wales the answer to that question will probably be no we ask people to stay safe to stay local we ve passed the peak but most accidents happen on the way down chances of getting coronavirus vaccine improving says vallance allison asks how do you expect those of us who live on the border with england to listen to you there is only very little difference between what happens on the left and right side of our border if you live in wales then you are subject to the rules that are made in wales the reason we have our rules is simple it 's not to deny anybody freedoms we wish they could have it is simple to continue the enormous collective effort people in wales have made to bear down on the virus with success nobody is safe from coronavirus it is a disease that can affect any one of us in wales we are taking a careful and cautious approach to it because in the long run we are sure that will pay dividends kelly asks how will people go back to work if schools are not reopened schools in wales have been open right through the coronavirus crisis for key workers people that are going back to work we have more pupils in our schools today than earlier on in the period and the number has risen over the last few weeks there are about 450 schools in wales

workers from the 400 nhs surcharge which is compulsory for the majority of foreign workers in the uk dominic raab has said under current immigration rules most people wanting to work in the uk must pay 400 per year which entitles them to use the nhs as part of their visa application amid the coronavirus crisis the home office exempt nhs workers from paying the charge for one year if their visas were due to expire before october it also said such workers would not need to apply for a new visa for a year uk absolutely preparing for second coronavirus peak extent of covid-19 spread in england hospitals not shared with nhs almost 40 % of english care homes had covid-19 no 10 admits home secretary priti patel was criticised for not scrapping the charge entirely for nhs staff with many claiming foreign health workers are forced to pay twice to use the service once in their visa and again when they are taxed before being paid their wages with the government bowing to pressure over the surcharge for nhs staff many foreign social carers had been hoping they too would soon be exempt from the charge however it does not look like this will happen anytime soon with the foreign secretary saying there s no current plans to make the change people have been calling for he insisted however that there would be a sensitive immigration system for all those exceptional frontline workers the nhs surcharge otherwise known as the immigration health surcharge was introduced in 2015 to directly increase the contribution to the nhs by immigrants and now brings in around 200 million per year for the government video report by itv news political correspondent carl dinnen the uk is absolutely preparing for a second peak of coronavirus despite a definite and sustained decline in new cases the deputy chief medical officer for england has said professor jonathan van tam speaking at the government 's daily coronavirus update said the risk in new peaks will only be truly averted when a vaccine is found but he added we ca n't be sure that will ever happen we may need to live and learn to live with this virus in the long term and certainly for many months to come if not several years prof van tam said social distancing had worked so far in reducing the spread of the virus he added but warned there may be an increase in cases when the season changes it may well be that the autumn and winter conditions provide a better environment for the virus to then do its work again so we have to be very cautious about that and plan for these kind of health care surges that we hope we do nt need but we want to be ready for them if they happen almost 40 % of english care homes had covid-19 no 10 admits loss of smell or taste added to nhs coronavirus symptoms list everyone aged over five with coronavirus symptoms now eligible for test he said people including himself had been hoping and praying that this virus will just go away but warned only once there was a vaccine that is really capable of suppressing disease levels will the country be out of this he was speaking at the press conference alongside foreign secretary dominic raab prof van tam also said that it does not seem that children are high output transmitters of coronavirus like they are with the flu he said that most children have only extremely mild covid-19 symptoms and the infection rate among them is about the same as in adults but possibly a little lower in younger aged children prof van tam said the data are pretty sparse at the moment with regards to childrens ability to transmit the virus to adults carl dinnen analyses the latest coronavirus briefing car making will vanish without scrappage scheme or similar but the experts have already had a look at this and formed a conclusion that unlike influenza unlike flu where we are very clear that children drive transmission in the community to adults it really does not seem to be the same kind of signal with covid-19 that children are not these kind of big high output transmitters as they are with flu he added mr van tam also explained why a new symptom the loss of smell or taste had been added to the list of recognised coronavirus indicators on monday morning anosmia was added to the list on monday morning despite some countries recognising the symptom weeks ago and many uk coronavirus sufferers saying they had experienced it he said just 0.44 % of people with coronavirus had reported anosmia on its own as a symptom but said the change in advice had been made to ensure such cases were not missed uk coronavirus toll rises

into a global champion pointing to a newly recognised coronavirus symptom mr hancock said anyone experiencing a loss or change in their sense of smell even without any other coronavirus symptom should self isolate for seven days he said 100,678 tests were carried out on sunday with the government now working towards our new goal of total capacity of 250,00 tests a day tests can be booked online

prioritise access to tests for nhs and social care patients residents mr hancock with test capacity increasing every day the uk now had all the elements we need to roll out our national test and trace service the other elements he said are the nhs contact tracing app and an army of contact tracers who will work together to track coronavirus wherever it goes in the country he said more than 21,000 contact tracers have been recruited in england to help manually trace the contacts of anyone who has had a positive covid-19 test they will help manually trace the contacts of anyone who s had a positive test and advise them on whether they need to isolate they have rigorous training with detailed procedures designed by our experts at public health england some 7,500 health care professionals are part of the contact tracing team and will provide call handlers with expert clinical advice he thanked those who have signed up to help saying they have stepped up to serve their county in its hour of need and i want to thank them in advance for the lifesaving work that they re about to do he said the nhs contact tracing app is being successfully piloted on the isle of wight adding we are

has covid-19 or not almost 40 % of english care homes had covid-19 no 10 admits loss of smell or taste added to nhs coronavirus symptoms list why did n't the government protect us earlier from covid-19 he told mps can he mr hancock tell us what is the current median time for test results to be received by someone when carried out by deloitte and other private sector testing facilities and how soon do directors of public health and gps receive those results mr hancock said the median time for receiving test results is under 48 hours and said the r rate is kept under review noting if we see an outbreak in an area then we will be perfectly prepared to take action in that area mr hancock told mps in the commons that the number of people in hospital with coronavirus is half what it was at the peak and that the number of patients in critical care is down by two thirds on the new symptom he said throughout this pandemic we ve said that if you develop a new continuous cough or a fever then you should immediately self isolate from today we are including anosmia which means that if you have lost your sense of smell or are experiencing a change in your normal sense of smell or taste that can be a symptom of coronavirus even where the other symptoms are not present almost four in 10 care homes in england have had outbreaks of coronavirus a spokesperson for the prime minister has said at least 5,889 care homes had reported a suspected outbreak of symptomatic or confirmed coronavirus as of may 17 number 10 confirmed the figure amounts to 38 % of care homes in england the spokesperson said in the last week a further 343 care homes reported suspected cases care home residents are among people described as clinically vulnerable to coronavirus which means many are at risk of becoming critically ill if they catch the virus the figures come despite transport secretary grant shapps saying on thursday that care homes were specialists in infection control and that the vast majority had made no reports of coronavirus more than 12,500 people in care homes have now died with coronavirus the government has been heavily criticised over its record on care homes with many questioning a policy early on in the crisis which saw coronavirus patients seeded into care homes when they were discharged from hospital without requiring a negative covid-19 test result first government care home advice prior to april 15 said negative tests are not required prior to transfers / admissions into the care home nhs providers admitted testing capacity was not sufficient enough to carry out tests consistently on all patients going into care homes until mid - april along with testing there are also concerns with ppe with niall dickson chief executive of the nhs confederation describing the failure in care homes as nothing short of a national disgrace figures from the office for national statistics released on friday showed at least 12,500 care home residents have now died having contracted coronavirus following criticism at prime minister 's questions of the government 's care home response boris johnson pledged 600 million to help care homes with coronavirus infection

place from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus video report by itv news correspondent damon green a government minister has indicated plans to reopen schools in england as early as june 1 will still go ahead despite disagreement from both parents and councils oliver dowden the culture secretary told itv news if we can get schools back by the beginning of june we should do but admitted discussions are ongoing with teachers ' unions who want the plan abandoning he said children in the most deprived areas often rely on going to school but a survey by the national education union neu showed just one third of poorest families say they will send children back before the end of term the prime minister 's spokesman hinted a decision on the reopening of schools next month will likely be made this week gove defends plans to reopen primary schools in england young children will still socially distance at school health chief says he said the government continues to want to work with schools in order to get more children back into an education setting as we have always said safety comes first but we must also be aware of the potential damage to a childs education from not getting them back in the classroom he added the comments follows the publishing of a lockdown roadmap which among other plans set the ambition that reception year one and year six pupils could begin a phased return to school as early as june 1 if science shows it is safe more than 420,000 people have signed an neu petition saying schools should only reopen when certain tests can be met which prove it is safe among other things the union wants to see concrete plans to have regular testing of children and staff availability of appropriate ppe and enhanced levels of cleaning it was one of six unions mb naht nasuwt neu unison and unite -which co - signed a letter calling for the prime minister to step back from his plans labour shadow home secretary nick thomas symonds echoed calls from school unions saying staff parents and pupils must all be reassured that all steps have been taken with regard to safety unless it 's done people just wo n't have confidence in this so i urge the government to get everybody around the table and to be transparent because that 's what we need to do going forward he said but it 's not just politicians unions and parents worried about reopening schools in june several councils have indicated they may defy government plans if they feel necessary councils in liverpool gateshead hartlepool newcastle sunderland wigan and rochdale have all expressed concerns with the plans what is the r value and why is the number one so important in stopping the spread of coronavirus the issue with a june reopening of schools arises from data showing significant differences in regional r numbers rate of infection labour deputy leader angela rayner said she backed councils in trying to ensure their residents are safe she told the bbcs andrew marr show on sunday that safety information for areas including greater manchester liverpool and the north east has nt been there we believe the r rate is higher in those areas in those regions so therefore we want the government to publish the science behind it and provide the support she said data released on may 14 showed the r number in london to be as low as 0.40 and as high as 0.80 in the north east and yorkshire boris johnson warned over fracturing of uk amid lockdown easing williamson stands firm on reopening of schools despite fierce criticism also on sunday cabinet minister michael gove sought to allay fears saying there is clear scientific and clinical advice that it is safe to schools to reopen with social distancing we want to proceed in a balanced way to ensure the children have the opportunity to be back in school to benefit from learning and as a result to ensure that their future can be more secure he told sky news sophy ridge on sunday programme but the chairman of the british medical association bma said the government should not consider reopening schools in england until the coronavirus case numbers are much lower meanwhile the leaders responsible for some 350,000 children signed a statement saying absence from school could be academically and socially calamitous for disadvantaged pupils the signatories who included dixons academies trusts sir nick weller and dame rachel de souza of inspiration trust said if we do not take action and reopen schools soon the impact of lost learning could be irreparable the gaps between the haves and the have nots in our communities are widening daily and we will face years of frantic endeavour in inevitable austerity to compensate for this dislocation of learning it is too easy to become obsessive in whole or partial lockdown and my obsession for weeks now is why ministers and whitehall failed to learn the big lesson of the 2007/8 banking crisis namely that high impact low probability risks wreak maximum damage and if they have the potential to destroy your way of life money and resource should be no object in warding them off to start on a more positive note boris johnson seems belatedly to have found the appropriate gauge of risk versus reward because although the pm on sunday conceded that a vaccine may never come to fruition he has nonetheless committed 93 million of our money to helping astrazeneca create a vaccine manufacturing plant that could make 30 million doses as soon as this september in normal circumstances it would be the height of public spending folly to commit 93 million on a venture knowing that there is a high probability it will be a white elephant but if you compare the 93 million with the hundreds of billions of income and tax revenues being wiped out by the epidemic or the 150 billion odd being spent by government on supporting jobs and livelihoods 93 million looks almost like a conservative investment one of those involved in the vaccine project put it like this to me we will have a first sense of whether the vaccine works by the end of our phase i / ii early june especially as it relates to safety but efficacy will only be proven or not by the end of august we are manufacturing at risk ie assuming the vaccine will be successful this is the only way to be ready to supply by the end of september if the efficacy is confirmed at the end of august we are completely changing the traditional development process where you wait to see efficacy and safety before manufacturing so it is not without risk but each dose of vaccine will cost the same as a cup of coffee the financial risk for government is minimal compared with the economic disaster we are experiencing the point is that because we are living and breathing the worst economic contraction for 300 years it is completely reasonable to contemplate writing off hundreds of millions of pounds on the pursuit of a vaccine there is however a multi billion pound begged question which is why the government did not spend more and much earlier on protecting us against this catastrophe now please do n't shout 20 20 hindsight at me johnson and the senior civil service were acutely aware of the risk of a health and economic disaster weeks before the first death and a month and a half before they took evasive action to repeat what i 've already shared with you on february 11 ministers knew that covid-19 had the potential to be a health and economic catastrophe worse than anything we 'd experienced for a century i was an eye witness in the sense that a senior member of the government briefed me that they feared the world health organisation was underplaying the gravity of the virus under pressure from china they knew there was no immunity in the population and there was a risk 60 % of the population would become infected at a mortality rate of 1 % 500,000 would die if there were a pandemic the peak would be march april may. on the evening of february 11 i shared all this with senior colleagues at itv and itv news to condition our coverage as we charted the merciless spread of the virus in our bulletins night after night i assumed naively it turns out that in government money would be no object and that behind the scenes all possible defences would be erected to protect us from this most savage of black swans but they were n't erected or at least not until the virus had spread so far and so fast that only the most economically expensive of comprehensive national lockdowns was capable of holding its vicious advance in check and even after that unprecedented restriction on our freedoms the prevalence of the virus has been permitted to become so great there are still so many people infected that restarting the economy is now that much more distant many prophylactic measures could have happened earlier from the prohibition of large gatherings to the expansion of testing and tracing capability to the increase in supplies of ppe protective equipment what went wrong as lawrence freedman demonstrates in what he calls his mini chilcot inquiry of the available evidence there was a failure of imagination and an absence of political leadership the tragic paradox is that the process in february for evaluating the risks through a hierarchy of expert committees with incomprehensible names sage nervtag spi m spi b became a substitute for taking evasive action there was a micawberish conviction in government that something would turn up and that by the sheer force of their intellects the scientists and social scientists would put a virus repelling force field around the uk the clinicians epidemiologists and behavioural scientists never succeeded in conveying to an intrinsically optimistic prime minister that time was of the essence boris johnson simply did not become frightened enough early enough this would be more understandable if it were clear only from the vantage of today but for those of us who lived and breathed the banking crisis of 2007/8 the failure to connect analysis with action in timelier fashion is disappointing to be clear this is not an ex post analogy as these world changing events were unfolding what was happening in wuhan felt the epidemiological equivalent of when mortgage backed securities markets closed in august 2007 italy 's debacle was lehman bros. at the time when agonising about this with friends and colleagues i felt like one of those lunatics warning about the end of the world i wondered if i had gone slightly mad since the government and life seemed to be chugging on regardless the truth however is that there is nothing terribly radical or unconventional about the idea that in a globalised world there are grave similarities between devastating systemic risks in finance and health or the environment for that matter if anything it is a bit of cliche although that does n't make it a lie so when the public enquiry into all this comes and it will come at least one of the questions that must be answered is whether what we 've lived through is a failure of an early warning system structural flaws in government or poor decision making by the prime minister and

just as we have done with other measures so for example the measures that we took when we introduced the so called lockdown those were underpinned by regulations which had consequences in law and i m sure well do the same thing ministers will launch a fresh attempt to repeal eu freedom of movement rules in the uk as flagship immigration legislation appears before mps the immigration and social security co - ordination eu withdrawal bill is intended to make it harder for unskilled workers to come to the uk it is part of the move towards the governments new points based immigration system to be introduced from 2021 although it does not set out the details on this these will be fleshed out in the immigration rules which will explain the future system for eu and non - eu nationals who move to the uk after the brexit transition period ends on december 2020 brexit and the nhs take centre stage in the latest queen 's speech visa surcharge for doctors and nurses coming to work in uk ' under

and then make its way through the parliamentary process it was previously introduced in the commons in december 2018 but stalled weeks later as then prime minister theresa mays minority administration lacked the numbers to win key brexit linked votes prime minister boris johnson brings it back with an 80-seat majority but amid pressure for the immigration rules to support those dubbed key workers during the coronavirus pandemic a yougov poll for the joint council for the welfare of immigrants jcwi suggested 54 % of britons would support loosening immigration restrictions for workers who were defined as essential during the crisis the governments list of critical workers includes people in the food production and processing industry such as delivery drivers those working in waste disposal and more in february the government announced proposals for the new system with points awarded for specific requirements such as being able to speak english to a certain level having a job offer from an approved employer and meeting a salary threshold of 25,600 other points could be awarded for certain qualifications and if there is a shortage in a particular occupation a visa allowing doctors nurses and health professionals from overseas to work in the nhs was introduced in march ahead of the bills return to the commons home secretary priti patel said in a brief statement this historic piece of legislation gives the uk full control of our immigration system for the first time in decades and the power to determine who comes to this country our new points based system is firmer fairer and simpler it will attract the people we need to drive our economy forward and lay the foundation for a high wage high skill high productivity economy speaking on bbc breakfast on monday morning the shadow home secretary said labour would not be supporting the bill because it is a threat to the health service and care sector nick thomas symonds continued it is rank hypocrisy to stand and clap for them on a thursday night then tell them they re not welcome on a monday he continued we have 180,000 eu nationals who are here who are frankly helping to keep our services going there are other workers in other sectors retail workers for example all of whom the government wants to send out a message to them with their new immigration system that they are low skilled i do not think it is right to be clapping our frontline workers and then today be sending out a signal that they are unskilled and unwelcome in the country it is not fair and it is not in the national interest elsewhere satbir singh chief executive of the jcwi called for further changes and said the fight against covid-19 has shown us all just how much our survival and wellbeing depends on our key workers so many of them have come from other countries and help keep this one running bus drivers and lorry drivers care workers and shop workers nurses and cleaners they are not unskilled or unwelcome they are the backbone of our country and they deserve the security of knowing that this place can be their home too video report by itv news correspondent amy lewis the government needs to invest money in children 's services to stop families reaching crisis point after coronavirus a group of leading charities have warned in a joint report by barnardo 's the children 's society action for children the nspcc and the national children 's bureau the charities warned the pandemic will exacerbate existing problems in underfunded local authorities the charities said the government must help local authorities invest in early intervention programmes as the demand for children 's services is expected to rise significantly they said as available funding for children 's services has fallen by 2.2 billion over the last decade councils and local authorities in england had been unable to pay for early intervention service which help families before problems escalate they also warn that as councils are unable to intervene early due to budget issues they are spending an increased proportion of their funding on children in crisis who require significant help such as being taken into care the charities said many local authorities are unprepared for further demand on their services and may even miss some vulnerable children hidden by the lockdown grant shapps announces ' nearly 2 billion for infrastructure projects barnardo 's chief executive javed khan said we have long warned about the perfect storm ' facing children 's social care and the gap between demand and resource will widen further as a result of coronavirus even before the lockdown children were facing growing challenges from knife crime and gangs to cyberbullying and online grooming now there is a new wave of hidden children falling into poverty experiencing domestic abuse and tipping the existing crisis in mental health into catastrophe the overstretched system can not cope and the government must step in to fund vital early intervention services so families get the help they need before reaching crisis point early intervention services include children 's centres youth workers and home school liaisons as well as preventative substance misuse and teenage pregnancy services late intervention services primarily deal with children with a higher level of need including youth justice and offending teams provision for children in care in addition to safeguarding and child protection work the charities said between 2010/11 and 2018/19 local authority spending on early intervention services dropped by 46 % investment in nhs digital transformation inadequate says national audit office however local authority spending on late intervention has risen from 58 % to78 % of spending on children and young people 's services in the same period the charities said the biggest increase in spending was seen on children in care which rose by 40 % from 2010/11 to 2018/19 local authorities currently manage by reallocating funds from other budgets with spending falling by 536 million between 2010/11 and 2018/19 one local authority staff member said what we ca n't keep on doing is we 've just kept on saying demand 's gone up again so we need to find some money we 'll use one off resources and then our savings target just keeps increasing we ca n't keep doing that you know year on year because the reserves will run out a government spokesman said we are giving councils an unprecedented package of support including 3.2 billion emergency funding to tackle the immediate pressures they have told us they 're facing this is on top of english councils ' core spending power rising by over 2.9 billion this financial year keeping vulnerable children safe is our priority which is why we have kept school places open for these children we have also committed additional funding worth 26.4 million directly to charities to support them as well as a 100 million devices and connectivity programme

ireland scotland and wales have not followed suit boris johnson warned over fracturing of uk amid lockdown easing what you can and ca n't do as lockdown restrictions ease in england face coverings advised from wednesday as coronavirus lockdown adjusts with debate over the reopening of schools and a return to work raging an opinium survey released this weekend has shown public dissatisfaction with the uk governments response to covid-19 has overtaken approval for the first time writing in the mail on sunday mr johnson said he can understand people will feel frustrated with some of the new rules but he urged britons to remain patient so the country does not risk reversing the gains we have so far won in the fight against the virus he wrote we are trying to do something that has never had to be done before moving the country out of a full lockdown in a way which is safe and does not risk sacrificing all of your hard work i recognise what we are now asking is more complex than simply staying at home but this is a complex problem and we need to trust in the good sense of the british people if we all stick at it then well be able gradually to get rid of the complexities and the restrictions but we must move slowly and at the right time only 39 % of britons approve of the governments response down from 48 % a week ago according to an opinium survey of 2,005 adults on

crisis had fallen mr burnham said the prime minister did not inform civic leaders of his easing of restrictions in advance and said the dropping of the stay at home message felt premature while cases of coronavirus have been easing in the south east mr burnham believed the loosening of restrictions came too quickly for the north where the r number the rate of transmission of the disease higher meanwhile only 39 % of britons approve of the governments response down from 48 % a week ago according to an opinium survey of 2,005 adults on wednesday and thursday those saying they disapproved rose from 36 % to 42 % northern mayors call on boris johnson to publish r number for each uk region scotland northern ireland and wales to stick with stay home message writing in the observer mr burham criticised mr johnson 's sunday night address to the nation that urged those who could not work from home to return to the workplace on the eve of a new working week the pm was on tv actively encouraging a return to work even though that would clearly put more cars on roads and people on trams no one in government thought it important to tell the cities that would have to cope with that he wrote the surprisingly permissive package might well be right for the south east given the fall in cases there but my gut feeling told me it was too soon for the north certainly the abrupt dropping of the clear stay at home message felt premature if the government carries on in the same vein expect to see an even greater fracturing of national unity different places will adopt their own messaging and policies last week mr burnham and his liverpudlian counterpart steve rotheram wrote to mr johnson calling on him to publish the r number for each region of the uk on a daily basis mr burnham told the calling peston podcast that the r number in the north west was at 0.8 too high for lockdown to be lifted in the region labour deputy leader angela rayner described government communication to local authorities as patchy and said she backed councils such as liverpool which is not planning to reopen schools to all pupils on june 1 in trying to ensure their residents are safe she told the bbcs andrew marr show on sunday that safety information for areas including greater manchester liverpool and the north east has nt been there we believe the r rate is higher in those areas in those regions so therefore we want the government to publish the science behind it and provide the support she said elsewhere education secretary gavin williamson has appealed to teaching unions to work with the government to find practical solutions to enable schools in england to begin re - opening his plea came amid fears that plans to start the phased re - opening of primary schools from next month as part of the easing of the coronavirus lockdown in the country may be scuppered if the unions refuse to co - operate talks on friday between union representatives and government scientific advisers intended to provide assurance about the governments proposals to enable children to return safely ended with union leaders saying it had raised more more questions than answers the brother of

williamson stands firm on schools in england reopening on june 1 as it is based on the best scientific advice mr williamson sought to reassure parents worried about children returning to school that the governments proposals are based on the best scientific advice with children at the very heart of everything we do his comments come as teaching unions and ministers have been told to stop squabbling and work together to help reopen schools in england uk coronavirus infection rate increases covid-19 death toll in uk increases by 468 bringing total to 34,466 mr williamson also apologised to students and thanked them for their sacrifices during the coronavirus pandemic i can only say how sorry i am that this has happened this year he said before adding the sacrifices that you have had to make through no choice of your own when asked by itv news ' political reporter shehab khan about what the r rate of infection number would have to reach for the government to reconsider its reopening of schools from june 1 mr williamson said that scientists had been consulted before the models were developed england 's deputy chief medical officer dr jenny harries said the r number range published on friday was 0.7 to 1.0 she explained there are different r values in three areas community care homes and hospitals and that any decisions on reversals would be down to ministers he added that there are children from difficult or very unhappy homes for whom school is the happiest moment in the week and the safest place to be and those children should be supported in their return to school the longer schools are closed the more children miss out mr williamson said lindsay said the reopening of schools was very risky given high rates of covid-19 particularly in areas such as gateshead where the r rate is currently highest what could cause a second coronavirus wave what is the r value and why is it important in stopping the spread of covid-19 mr williamson explained that the government will look at the r rate in great detail and schools will only return if five tests have been met responding to mr williamsons comment at the briefing patrick roach general secretary of the nasuwt teachers union said in a statement the nasuwt welcomes the secretary of states commitment to discuss a way forward which will help to ensure that schools can reopen safely to more children it is urgently important that the government takes every available opportunity to provide the necessary assurances that teachers are seeking he continued schools are looking to the government for clear and unequivocal guidance on the health and safety measures they will need to have in place prior to reopening the bottom line is that no teacher or child should be expected to go into schools until it can be demonstrated that it is safe for them to do so the latest from the government briefing comes after a number of council in england have voiced their opposition to the reopening of schools gateshead council leader described the move to bring pupils back to school as madness while others have vowed to defy central government if schools are told to reopen gateshead council leader martin gannon said on friday that his councils advice continued to be to stay at home he said his views on the lockdown were echoed by his counterparts in newcastle and sunderland mr gannon told the bbc the national advice telling us the lockdown is over is frankly madness to gateshead among the councils who are said to have concerns about reopening schools include liverpool gateshead hartlepool

health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus health secretary matt hancock has announced the government will test every staff member and every resident of care homes in england for covid-19 even if they do not show symptoms between now and june speaking at the uk government 's daily coronavirus briefing mr hancock said there has been a huge need to protect people in care homes before adding that the government has worked to do this right from the start mr hancock said two thirds of care homes in england have not had an outbreak and the number of deaths have halved since the peak coronavirus death toll in uk increases by 384 bringing total to 33,998 uk coronavirus infection rate increases mr hancock also said that age is the biggest factor in a person 's risk to coronavirus and added there needs to be access for everyone in care homes it is true that age is the biggest factor in terms of your risk to coronavirus but absolutely we need to make sure that care homes for people of working age also have access to tests and we 're rolling that out he said he added that 600 m has been made available to care homes this week to help control the infection this is in addition to the 172 m made available to devolved governments mr hancock announced he also confirmed that a further 384 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the uk taking the total to 33,998 mr hancock continued to say the latest r rate is based on data from a couple of weeks ago adding that it is an important figure for policymakers it comes as the revised figures from the sage group of scientific advisers say the r number has increased and is now between 0.7 and 1.0 mr hancock also urged for the public to play their part in keeping r down by following social distancing rules england 's deputy chief medical officer dr jenny harries said it is important to keep the r reproduction rate below 1 she explained the reason for a range in the r number outlined in the statistics what could cause a second coronavirus wave what is the r value and why is it important in stopping the spread of covid-19 she said there s quite a range there 0.7 to one in the estimate of r and this is for a number of reasons partly because a number of different models are used to model this data and its important that they challenge each other and that we get the consistency of that she added she continued partly the data comes from historic data obviously we ca nt predict precisely so were estimating it on different sources of information so things like hospital admissions that have happened historically and then i think thirdly importantly we know that we have slightly different r values relating to some areas of risks so obviously in recent weeks care homes have been heightened interest hospitals also and we keep an eye on those so this is very much a national average when asked about the plan for schools reopening in england in june and also what consequences schools could face if they do nt open hancock said it is really important this is a team effort he added i would n't support a proposal to start to reopen schools unless it was safe to do so and it is safe to do so he added the good news is it seems to spare children in almost every case so the risk to children is much much lower than anyone else in society dr harries said the likelihood of anyone

have to return to austerity and make spending cuts because of the hundreds of billions of debts being accumulated by the treasury through its many schemes to limit the harm to our prosperity of the coronavirus epidemic bailey told peston there are choices and i hope those choices will be looked at very seriously i think one of the reasons that the bank of england which is obviously acquiring a much larger stock of government debt than in the financial crisis of 10 12 years ago would have been imagined is what we can do providing you know the overall credibility of the framework remains in

claimed his two 1975 convictions were unsafe because his detention at maze prison in northern ireland was not personally considered by a senior government minister mr adams 71 attempted to escape from the maze also known as long kesh internment camp on christmas eve 1973 and again in july 1974 he was later sentenced to a total of four and a half years at a hearing in november lawyers for mr adams argued that because the interim custody order ico used to initially detain him in july 1973 was not authorised by the then secretary of state for northern ireland willie whitelaw his detention was unlawful and his convictions should be overturned announcing the supreme courts judgment at a remote hearing on wednesday lord kerr the former lord chief justice of northern ireland said the court had unanimously allowed mr adams appeal and had quashed his convictions the judge said mr adams detention was unlawful because it had not been considered personally by mr whitelaw lord kerr said the making of the ico in respect of the appellant was invalid since the secretary of state had not himself considered it in consequence mr adams detention was unlawful hence his convictions of attempting to escape from lawful custody were likewise unlawful lord kerr added the appeal is therefore allowed and his convictions are quashed the judge explained that mr adams had been detained under an ico made under the detention of terrorists northern ireland order 1972 and that such an order could be made where the secretary of state considered that an individual was involved in terrorism mr adams has consistently denied being a member of the ira in the courts written judgment lord kerr said the power to make such an order was a momentous one describing it as a power to detain without trial and

response mr johnson 's prerecorded address which set out how lockdown would be eased in england to increase outdoor activity and promote a return to work was criticised by the labour leader as lacking clarity what we needed from the prime minister last night was clarity and reassurance sir keir said we needed to hear that nobody would be asked to go to work or send their children to school without it being safe to do so we needed to know that the huge problems we ve seen with protective equipment are over that the crisis in our care homes has finally been gripped that everybody who needs a test

plan to rebuild strategy for covid-19 recovery is that somehow the pm succeeded in alienating the leaders of wales and scotland and create an apparent rift between the nations when the liberation from lockdown he is offering the people of england is so slight as to be barely perceptible there is a tonal shift in respect of work namely that the pm would like to see businesses that are not on the proscribed list such as factories and building sites operating again but that 's a wish not an order and the overarching message is unchanged namely that it is far better to work from home where that is possible in other words the pm would much prefer nissan motorcars to be handcrafted in workers ' front rooms but since that is unlikely to be feasible any time soon he would nudge car workers back to the production line so long as they and their robots can be insulated from the virus as for the long lost social side of our lives we are now permitted to play singles tennis but not doubles unless

we can still go out for walks with everyone who lives with us but the other members of our households have to make themselves scarce if in the course of the excursion we meet and stop to chat with our respective mums and if mum happens to be out with dad one of them has to hop off if a chance meeting turns into a serious encounter oh and you can drive to the other side of the country if it takes your fancy but you have to be home before bedtime overnight stays are still banned anywhere but your own bed as for face coverings they should preferably be improvised affairs rather than medical ones because proper masks are needed by our front line carers and the government has advised later than some say is ideal that it is a good idea to wear these coverings on a bus or train or other indoor peopled space but wearing a piece of cloth over mouth and nose is not obligatory except in the sense that if everyone else starts to wear them you may feel socially awkward and naked without one this is freedom in the style of alice in wonderland redrafted by franz kafka but few of us will complain if it prevents any new and devastating surge in the spread of the virus but it is all a bit confusing and the carrots offered by the pm for good behaviour are n't much less stressful there is the idea that we may be able to enlarge our household circle by nominating another household as part

coronavirus lockdown adjustments-50-page document|2020 05 11|video report by itv news political editorrobert peston prime minister boris johnson has adjusted the coronavirus lockdown in england in order to gradually rebuild our economy and open our society after making a national address on sunday evening the pm gave an update to mps on how the lockdown would be eased after the government published a 50-page document revealing details of the forthcoming plan step one to easing the lockdown begins on wednesday with the government hoping for step two to start on june 1 and step three by july 4 speaking in the commons mr johnson told mps if we stay on the downward slope and the r rate of infection remains below one then and only then would it become safe to go further and move to the second step details of the further steps are outlined below with the government saying they will only be taken if the five tests pictured below are met the prime minister said in a commons statement that the government would be driven by data and science and public health in easing the restrictions mr johnson said he will not hesitate to put on the brakes in relaxing the lockdown if evidence shows the r number rate of infection is rising with matters of health devolved mr johnson does not speak for wales scotland or northern ireland his changes only apply to england mr johnson acknowledged different parts of the uk may need to stay in full lockdown longer but said that should only be short term he added there is a very very strong desire to move forward as four nations together we all share this strong view that you should stay at home if you can that remains the position the snp 's westminster leader ian blackford pointed out that the advice in devolved nations clearly remains stay at home protect the nhs and save lives mr blackford added that the government had not shared the new stay alert slogan with the devolved administrations and that they learnt of the change in the sunday newspapers will the prime minister commit not to deploy this new slogan in scotland and wales and northern ireland unless the devolved governments decide otherwise he asked itv news political editor robert peston explains how the nations within the uk have reacted to boris johnson 's announcements in a direct response to the pm 's sunday evening national address labour leader sir keir starmer recorded his own speech in which he attacked the government 's coronavirus response in the speech he said the prime minister said he was setting out a road map but if we are to complete the journey safely a road map needs clear directions sir keir told the commons the country needs clarity and reassurance from the government with both being in pretty short supply he said mr johnson had made his sunday evening speech before the plan was written or at least finalised so what do the eased restrictions in england look like friends and family in public spaces the government has updated its advice on outdoor activity after evidence showed the risk of infection outside is significantly lower than inside from wednesday people may go outdoors as many times each day as they wish the document says as opposed to just for one hour as was previously the rule mr johnson said people can meet up with one person who is not part of their household so long as they maintain a distance of at least two metres from each other so from wednesday people will be able to go angling play tennis and go for picnics and sunbathe video report by itv news correspondent damon green in an address to mps in the commons mr johnson said people can walk sit and rest in parks they can even go swimming in lakes and the sea people are also now permitted to visit garden centres which have been told they can reopen people are still not able to use areas like playgrounds outdoor gyms or ticketed outdoor leisure venues where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces people may also drive to outdoor open spaces irrespective of distance so long as they respect social distancing guidance while they are there leaving home to stay at another home for a holiday or other purpose is not allowed this includes visiting second homes premises such as hotels and bed and breakfasts will remain closed except where providing accommodation for specific reasons set out in law such as for critical workers where required for a reason relating to their work when travelling to outdoor spaces it is important that people respect the rules in scotland wales and northern ireland and do not travel to different parts of the uk step two on family and friends for step two which the government hopes will begin on june 1 a range of options are being considered to reduce the impact of social distancing it has asked sage the scientific advisory group for emergencies to assess whether people should be allowed to expand their household group to include one other household in the same exclusive group mr johnson told mps nothing can substitute for human contact and so the government has asked sage when and how we can safely allow people to expand their household group to include one other household on a strictly reciprocal basis the aim of this plan is to allow those who are isolated some more social contact and to reduce the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions the government is also examining how to enable people to gather in slightly larger groups to better facilitate small weddings the workplace in his address the prime minister said people should be actively encouraged to return to work from wednesday if they are unable to work from home however he said people should only return to work where social distancing can be observed and at firms which are covid secure but there was confusion over exactly who should return to work the document published on monday offers a little more detail the document says for the foreseeable future workers should continue to work from home rather than their normal physical workplace wherever possible the government says this is to protect those who must physically attend work by minimising the risk of overcrowding on transport and in public places the document says sectors of the economy that are allowed to be open should be open sectors encouraged to reopen include garden centres food production construction manufacturing logistics distribution and scientific research in laboratories sectors that must remain closed hospitality and non - essential retail nannies and childminders can also return to work if safe to do so see section on schools to allow more parents to return to work anyone with symptoms should not return to work and should instead self isolate as should members of their household if someone is concerned that an employer is not taking all practical steps to promote social distancing then they can be reported to local authorities or the health and safety executive these bodies can take a range of action including where appropriate requiring your employer to take additional steps step two for workplaces from june 1 the government hopes non - essential retail shops will be able to in reopen in phases firms will only be allowed to reopen if they comply with new covid-19 secure guidelines which will be released shortly businesses will be told at which phase they are allowed to reopen all other sectors that are currently closed including the hospitality and personal care industries are not able to re - open at this point because the risk of transmission in these environments is higher the opening of such sectors is likely to take place in phases during step three which the government believes will be no earlier than july 4 video report by itv news correspondent richard pallot at this point if safe to do so businesses such as hairdressers beauty salons food service providers pubs and accommodation will be allowed to reopen in phases public places such as places of worship and leisure facilities like cinemas may also be allowed to open at this point venues which are crowded and where it may prove difficult to obey distancing may still not be able to re - open safely at this point schools / education when imposing the lockdown the prime minister ordered the closure of all schools except for the children of key workers who should be allowed to attend lessons the government says that resulted in just 2 % of children attending lessons in person but there is a large social benefit for vulnerable children in attending school the government document said as such from wednesday the government wants schools to urge more children who would benefit from attending in person to do so children will not be expected to wear face coverings while at school paid childcare is allowed to resume including nannies and childminders as long as it 's safe to do so the government says this should help working parents return to work video report by itv news correspondent john ray step two for schools step two for schools will begin with a phased return for early years the government has said it has advised schools to prepare for a reopening as soon as june 1 with the expectation that primary children will be able to return from this date there is an ambition to have all primary children back at school a month before the summer if feasible though this will be kept under review secondary schools and colleges should also prepare for face to face contact with some of their pupils namely those in the later years who have key exams next year this is to allow teachers to support children 's continued remote home learning ahead of their exams travel when travelling the government says everybody including critical workers should continue to avoid public transport wherever possible it is encouraging people to only travel by foot bicycle or by car however it acknowledges public transport is essential for some people in getting to work with more people returning to work demand for public transport will increase the government is working with public transport providers to bring services back as quickly as possible to pre - coronavirus levels so people are able to keep a safe distance from others to promote cycling the government says it will increase funding and provide new guidance to encourage local authorities to widen pavements create pop up cycle lanes and close some roads in cities to traffic apart from buses face coverings as people return to work the government wants people to wear a face covering in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible it says while on public transport or in supermarkets face coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission though wearing them is not compulsory face coverings are not intended to help the wearer but to protect against transmission of the disease to others the government says people should not wear clinical face masks which are intended for health care professionals but homemade face coverings which are also beneficial international travel the prime minister told mps that anyone arriving from overseas should isolate for 14 days unless they are on a shortlist all international arrivals must supply their contact and accommodation information if they are unable to do so they must stay in somewhere arranged by the government everyone arriving from overseas will also be strongly advised to download and use the nhs contact tracing app international travel measures will not come into force on wednesday may 13 but will be introduced as soon as possible all of our precautions will count for little if our country is reinfected from overseas the prime minister told mps however a reciprocal deal between the uk and france means that anyone travelling between the two countries will not need to isolate for two weeks further details and guidance will be set out shortly the government said other measures from june 1 the government hopes sporting events such as football matches will be safe to take place behind closed doors for broadcast so long as social distancing is respected there 's also the hope that more local public transport in urban areas will be allowed to reopen subject to strict measures to limit as far as possible the risk of infection in these normally crowded spaces while some restrictions are slackening fines for breaching coronavirus regulations in england will rise from 60 to 100 the pm said the fine will double for each infringement reaching a maximum of 3,600 the increase in fines

wednesday to help slow the spread of coronavirus dominic raab has confirmed as he set out to clarify the prime minister 's lockdown adjustments the foreign secretary told itv news that face coverings do n't really have much of an impact in protecting the wearer but they can provide an incremental mitigation of the risk to other people on the government 's morning round of media interviews mr raab was hoping to answer some of the many questions raised by boris johnson 's sunday evening national address in which he set out a road map for ending lockdown the sunday speech was hotly anticipated by the public hoping major changes to the lockdown and newspaper reports in the week had front pages suggesting restrictions would be lifted but the very minor adjustments including a tweak to coronavirus messaging which changed stay at home to stay alert caused many to demand clarity pm to give more detail on plans to ease coronavirus lockdown how do lockdown regulations differ across the uk other adjustments mean from wednesday people will be allowed to have unlimited outdoor exercise and those who can not work from home should return to work so long as social distancing can be observed outdoor meetings between people of different households are one area of contention with many hoping they could finally see loved ones they 've been forced to separate from earlier mr raab said people could for example meet with both of their parents in a park so long as they are a safe distance apart but officials were forced to clarify shortly after saying mr raab had got it wrong in fact people can only meet with one individual from a different household at one time it 's also unclear exactly who should return to work with confusion over which firms can operate safely with social distancing the pm will provide a detailed 50-page plan to gradually ease the coronavirus lockdown when the government publishes its official guidance he posted an eight tweet thread to twitter ahead of the document being released repeatedly urging people to stay alert mr johnson will also face mps on monday to offer more information and he 's sure to face questioning from the likes of labour 's keir starmer and the snp 's ian blackford both criticised the government 's plan which did not include wales scotland or northern ireland calling for consensus among all uk nations all nations of the uk other than england are keeping their stay at home message and are continuing to largely enforce their lockdowns labour leader sir keir said the announcement lacked clarity and consensus while effectively telling millions of people to go back to work tomorrow without clear guidelines he said this statement raises as many questions as it answers and we see the prospect of england scotland and wales pulling in different directions mr johnson will offer answers to mps in a statement to the commons with more information expected on a covid-19 alert system use of face coverings and the return of professional football further details are also expected on plans to impose a 14-day quarantine on people flying into the uk and on a five tier alert system to inform relaxation and strengthening of measures speaking to itv news mr raab said those who may be in closed spaces with people from other households will be encouraged to wear a covering on their face he said there s a difference between masks which are used in a clinical setting for doctors nurses care home workers and face coverings the kind of diy cloth mask that someone might put together at home in relation to face coverings they do nt really have much of an impact in terms of protecting the person wearing it but they can provide an incremental mitigation of the risk of transmission to other people boris johnson to give more detail on plans to gradually ease coronavirus lockdown to mps boris johnson 's omission could 'cause huge problems for wales so we will say from wednesday in areas where you worry that you may be enclosed spaces with other people or with other people not from your own home that we will encourage people in those particular circumstances to wear a face covering the starting point for lockdown fines in england will rise to 100 from wednesday the first fine will be lowered to 50 if paid within 14 days according to the home office fines will double for each repeat offence up to a

longer a national address no sooner had boris johnson finished his speech than the first ministers of scotland wales and northern ireland were instructing their nations to mostly ignore it in scotland regardless of what the uk pm says people are not to travel in the car for exercise or have picnics in the park sunbathing does nt exist in scotland anyway so no change there nicola sturgeon is clear the message is not stay at home if you can in scotland it is still stay at home full stop this is where there is some conflict people in england are being told they can travel by car again people in scotland still can not therefore people in england need to be aware they are not yet allowed to travel to scotland such a journey could see them in trouble with police scotland for breaking scotlands rules north of the border people will not return to work this week construction companies are not starting up again here even if they are in england how do lockdown restrictions differ in england scotland wales and northern ireland it is still unclear if the uk government has agreed to keep covering the costs of the job retention scheme for furloughed construction workers in scotland though while construction workers are no longer furloughed in england this scheme is funded by the uk treasury and scotland simply does not have the financial levers to cover these costs if it is not paid for by the uk detail like this will become clear in the coming days but while sturgeon certainly has the powers to extend lockdown her reliance on the uk for the money to cover it could end up forcing her hand also what happens if your english based company is reopening your place of work just south of the border this week and you re expected to go back to work but you live in a town in scotland

experience of every other country has shown its the only way to defeat the coronavirus the most vicious threat this country has faced in my lifetime and though the death toll has been tragic and the suffering immense and though we grieve for all those we have video report by itv news political correspondent daniel hewitt downing street has hit back at newspaper reports that boris johnson and his administration dragged their feet in the run up to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic number 10 accused the sunday times of falsehoods and errors after the newspaper published a piece in which a whitehall source claimed the government missed the boat on testing and ppe personal protective equipment the article also claimed the johnson administration just watched as the death toll mounted in wuhan china a government spokesman said this article contains a series of falsehoods and errors and actively misrepresents the enormous amount of work which was going on in government at the earliest stages of the coronavirus outbreak this is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it guided at all times by the best scientific advice the government has been working day and night to battle against coronavirus delivering a strategy designed at all times to protect our nhs and save lives our response has ensured that the nhs has been given all the support it needs to ensure everyone requiring treatment has received it as well as providing protection to businesses and reassurance to workers the prime minister has been at the helm of the response to this providing leadership during this hugely challenging period for the whole nation grotesque to criticise pm over missing coronavirus meetings the tone of the statement posted on the official gov.uk website was much more aggressive than that used by the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster michael gove on sunday morning tv appearances when he described the article as off beam mr gove had confirmed the sunday times report that the pm had not attended five meetings of the key government committee cobra in the run up to the crisis but insisted this was not unusual that stance was echoed by the government spokesman who said it is entirely normal and proper for cobr to be chaired by the relevant secretary of state at this point the world health organisation had not declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern and only did so only on january 30 indeed they chose not to declare a pheic the day after the cobr meeting "in reference to the report that the uk sent 279,000 items of protective equipment to china earlier this year the government spokesman said the equipment was not from the pandemic stockpile we provided this equipment to china at the height of their need and china has since reciprocated our donation many times over between april 2-april 15 we have received over 12 million pieces of ppe in the uk from china ending social distancing risks second wave of deaths in uk shadow health secretary jonathan ashworth told sky news there are serious questions as to why the prime minister skipped five cobra meetings throughout february when the whole world could see how serious this was becoming and we know that serious mistakes have been made we know that our frontline nhs staff do n't have the ppe that they 've been told this weekend that they wo n't necessarily have the gowns which are vital to keep them safe we know that our testing capacity is not at the level that is needed we know that the ventilators that many hospitals have received are the wrong types of ventilators and there are big questions as to whether we went into this lockdown too slowly and now we hear the prime minister missed five meetings at the start of this outbreak it suggests that early on he was missing in action paul marshall makes the compelling point that mistakes have almost certainly been made by scientists and public health england but in the british system power lies not with the scientists and officials but with the elected politicians and i have been concerned since the start of this outbreak that ministers were using the expert advice of the scientists and epidemiologists and the recommendations of the assorted expert committees as a reason not to take responsibility for life and death decisions we 're following the science has been the ministerial mantra and clich of this crisis and if we 've learned anything in this crisis it is the limits of scientific knowledge in respect of a new virus coronavirus questions emerge about government 's early response to covid-19 crisis should we be relieved to be governed by the scientists what matters i think is not the precise date of the lockdown we wo n't know for some time whether these unprecedented restrictions on our freedoms were implemented too early too late or just about the right time but what we do know beyond reasonable doubt is that it was eminently possible to increase investment in testing capacity many weeks earlier than happened and it should have been possible to learn there was not enough ppe protective clothing equipment for all healthcare workers in hospitals care homes and assorted public services the big point as i said last night is that ministers were well aware in the second week of february that there was a very real risk that a devastating epidemic was coming our way as i mentioned on 11 february i was briefed by a senior member of the government that we should know within a fortnight if we are looking at pandemic in uk if there is a pandemic the peak will be march april may. the marginally better news is mortality rate is looking less than 2 % and for most people rest and isolation will lead to recovery but the risk is 60 % of the population getting it with a mortality rate of perhaps just over 1 % we are looking at not far off 500,000 deaths i sent those notes of my conversation with that senior government member to colleagues at itv and itv news so that it would condition our coverage and the reason i am dredging the notes up now is not to prove that the government ignored a certain catastrophe what i was told by that government source more than two months ago looks chillingly prophetic but at the time ministers did not know whether they could shield the uk from a major outbreak of covid-19 they were hoping for the best but they were acutely aware of the worst so the question is whether in the absence of certainty but the presence of a known catastrophic risk of devastating outbreak it would have been sensible to expedite an assessment of the uk 's resources to cope with such an outbreak and correct the deficiencies in a timelier and earlier fashion this would have meant spending public funds and if covid-19 had never arrived in scale here some would have accused the government of wasting that money but from today 's vantage point wasting public funds in the cause of public health looks money well wasted hindsight is wonderful for the avoidance of doubt this is not me looking to name and shame individuals in government or advising government who may have got it wrong it is to highlight the gap between the government 's capacity to identify a clear and present danger and then take the steps to limit its harm this looks like a systemic problem it happened in the run up to the banking crisis too lessons need to be learned it is grotesque to suggest that boris johnson skipped meetings that were vital to the uk 's coronavirus response a cabinet minister has said a wide ranging sunday times report detailed how the prime minister missed five meetings of the government 's key cobra committee as the health crisis was gathering pace it followed an investigation in the sunday times in which a whitehall source claimed the government missed the boat on testing and ppe personal protective equipment and just watched as the death toll mounted in wuhan china the newspaper also claimed the government missed a series of opportunities to try and lessen the impact of the outbreak in february and march the virus has now claimed the lives of more than 2 million people worldwide including more than 16,000 in hospitals in the uk according to latest figures thousands more people are thought to have died in care homes and in the community itv news political correspondent daniel hewitt says questions are being asked of whether the lockdown was brought in early enough michael gove sought to downplay the report and defended the pm saying mr johnson was throwing heart and soul into fighting this virus speaking on sky news ' sophy ridge on sunday the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster added the idea that the prime minister skipped meetings that were vital to our response to the coronavirus i think is grotesque however appearing on bbc one 's the andrew marr show mr gove confirmed the pm did not attend five cobra meetings in the run up to the outbreak arriving in the uk stating he did n't but then he would n't because most cobra meetings do n't have the prime minister attending them asked what was incorrect in the sunday times report mr gove said i wo n't go through a point by point rebuttal of all the things in the sunday times story that are a little bit off beam but that will be done later earlier on sunday a spokesperson for mr johnson issued a pointed response to the claims made by the sunday times the prime minister has been at the helm of the response to this providing leadership during this hugely challenging period for the whole nation the spokesperson said how the government could have done more earlier to protect against covid-19 coronavirus lockdown restrictions extended for at least three more weeks what is sage and who are the experts behind the government 's covid-19 response the claims came as the prime minister who is recovering from coronavirus was said to have been giving directions to ministers from the country retreat of chequers where he is recuperating the number 10 response paints a different picture of the pm to the one depicted in the sunday times in the run up to the outbreak as the newspaper quoted a senior downing street aide who was not named saying there s no way you re at war if your pm is nt there and what you learn about boris was he did nt chair any meetings he liked his country breaks he did nt work weekends it was like working for an old fashioned chief executive in a local authority 20 years ago there was a real sense that he did nt do urgent crisis planning it was exactly like people feared he would be shadow health secretary jonathan ashworth argued that mr gove 's line that one or two aspects of the sunday times story were off beam is possibly the weakest rebuttal of a detailed expose in british political history he told sky 's sophy ridge on sunday none of us expect the impossible we understand that mistakes will be made in a crisis of this nature but there are serious questions as to why the prime minister skipped five cobra meetings throughout february when the whole world could see how serious this was becoming and we know that serious mistakes have been made we know that our front line nhs staff do n't have the ppe that they 've been told this weekend that they wo n't necessarily have the gowns which are vital to keep them safe we know that our testing capacity is not at the level that is needed we know that the ventilators that many hospitals have received are the wrong types of ventilators and there are big questions as to whether we went into this lockdown too slowly and now we hear the prime minister missed five meetings at the start of this outbreak it suggests that early on he was missing in action coronavirus delivery of 84 tonnes of personal protective equipment for nhs delayed the report comes as controversy continued to grow over the insufficient levels of personal protection equipment ppe for frontline nhs staff and criticism that not enough people were being tested for the killer virus however a delivery of 84 tonnes of desperately needed personal protective equipment for front line nhs staff as they treat patients with coronavirus which was meant to arrive in the uk on sunday has been delayed it is not currently known when the shipment which includes 400,000 gowns will arrive instead or what caused the delay appearing on sunday 's political programmes mr gove also denied suggestions the government has drawn up plans for a three tiered relaxation of lockdown measures on monday the country will enter its fifth week in lockdown with continued clamour for a relaxation of measures that have shut schools and businesses scaled back transport and closed and parks and public spaces closed as britons are

combating coronavirus it follows the government 's earlier 250 million pledge to develop a vaccine as well as providing industry and research institutions with the resources and support the new taskforce will review regulations to allow quick and safe vaccine trials the initiative will also scale up manufacturing so that when a vaccine becomes available it can be produced quickly and in mass quantities the new taskforce will include representatives from the government academia and industry as well as government life sciences champion sir john bell astrazeneca and the wellcome trust announcing the taskforce mr sharma added uk scientists are working as fast as they can to find a vaccine that fights coronavirus saving and protecting people 's lives we stand firmly behind them in their efforts the vaccine taskforce is key to co - ordinating efforts to rapidly accelerate the development and manufacture of a potential new vaccine so we can make sure it is widely available to patients as soon as possible the group will focus on five strands of activity including supporting the discovery of potential coronavirus vaccines and preparing the uk for clinical vaccine testing and

one place from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus more than 40 % of carers surveyed in an exclusive poll for itv news say they are dealing with suspected cases of covid-19 in care homes providing the largest snapshot yet of the crisis in our care sector the survey of over 2,800 carers found 42 % were looking after residents who had suspected covid-19 a further 28 % said they were dealing with cases which had been officially confirmed furthermore 12 % said that they were aware of staff who d also tested positive the responses to the poll carried out in conjunction with carehome.co.uk suggest that the virus may be spreading much faster in care settings than the government suggests on thursday the health and social care secretary matt hancock said that only 15 % of care homes had reported cases the sector still struggles to confirm suspected cases of coronavirus due to a lack of testing on wednesday the government promised that all residents and carers who needed a test in england would be able to access to one but 80 % of those surveyed said that there has been no screening of staff so far and 75 % said that residents had nt been tested either paul brand on how care home residents and workers do not feel their part of the covid-19 story is being told as the data for the sector remains unclear families pay tribute to their loved ones who died from virus and story of hope itv news has been reporting on the crisis in care including the lack of protective equipment this week the government promised to get more ppe to the front line but 54 % of carers said they still do nt have the protection they need to carry out their jobs safely the survey also suggests that covid-19 is having an impact on carers mental as well as physical health as itv news reported earlier this month care home staff are often the only people allowed into a residents room before they die with covid-19 leaving carers with the full burden of saying goodbye thirty two per cent of those who responded to the survey said that they need help with their mental health as a result of the crisis while 83 % are anxious about transmitting the virus to their own families at home the survey is only an indication of what 's happening in the care sector but until the government provides more data it is arguably the most comprehensive picture we have and it would imply that a sector which specialises in providing care does n't necessarily feel like it is receiving it a department of health and social care spokesperson said we are committed to doing everything we can to reduce the number of infections and care homes are an absolute priority we are working hard to rapidly scale up testing and ppe deliveries with everyone going into a care home from hospital now being tested with immediate effect already over 4,000 care workers have been referred to testing and over 10,000 care residents have been tested on top of this we are providing

spread of the virus eligibility for coronavirus testing has been extended to police fire service prison staff critical local authority workers the judiciary and dwp staff who need it matt hancock has said the health secretary facing a grilling from the commons health committee said he was able to extend eligibility due to test capacity increasing and the coronavirus curve now being under control i can today expand the eligibility for testing to police the fire service prison staff critical local authority staff the judiciary and dwp staff who need it and were able to do that because of the scale up of testing he said he appeared to admit there had been issues in the past with test capacity but said what really matters is what were going to do from here on in testing was previously only available to patients for surveys and for nhs and social care staff and some that go to lrfs for local urgent need he said 18,665 tests had been carried out in the last 24 hours well short of the government 's target for 100,000 a day by the end of april labour leader starmer urges government to publish exit strategy this week the aim going forward is to be able to get back to the position that we can test everybody with symptoms and i anticipate being able to do that relatively soon because were increasing capacity as i say mr hancock said that more than 50,000 nhs workers have now been tested for coronavirus i can tell you that over 50,000 people that work in the nhs have now had tests he said pushed on whether he has an estimate for the number of health workers who have been infected he added no i do nt what i have is an estimate of the proportion who are off work because they either have suspected covid-19 or a household member does which is a little over 8 % and obviously with the expansion of testing we hope to be able to get that figure down also giving evidence to the committee was prof anthony costello chairman of global health at university college london who warned britain will face further waves of coronavirus and will probably have the highest death rate in europe because the government was too slow to act he said the harsh reality is that we were too slow with a number of things if were going to suppress the chain of transmission of this virus in the next stage we all hope that the national lockdown and social distancing will bring about a large suppression of the epidemic so far but were going to face further waves he said and so we need to make sure that we have a system in place that can not just do a certain number of tests in the laboratory but has a system at district and community level should we be relieved to be governed by the scientists mr hancock was also asked about a lack of personal protective equipment ppe in the care sector he admitted the uk is tight on gowns but that 55,000 more are due to arrive today he said there had been a herculean effort to deliver ppe around the country and that as of this weekend 1 billion items of protective equipment would have been shipped it is understanding in a massive undertaking like that that there are complications and that there are challenges and i take responsibility for getting ppe out to everyone after reports some health care professionals had been forced to wash and reuse ppe mr hancock said in some cases the reuse of ppe is advised by clinicians i would love to be able to wave a magic wand and have ppe fall from the sky in large quantities and be able to answer your question about when shortages will be resolved but given that we have a global situation in which there is less ppe in the world than the world needs obviously its going to be a huge pressure point he added there s nothing that i can say at this select committee that will take away the fact that we have a global challenge and were doing everything we can to resolve it to get that ppe to the front line coronavirus everything you need to know check the number

the virus itv news washington correspondent robert moore explains the latest from the usa new white house guidelines outline a phased approach to restoring normal commerce and services but only for places with strong testing and seeing a decrease in covid-19 cases president donald trump unveiled his administrations plans to ease social distancing requirements on a call thursday with the nations governors the new guidelines are aimed at clearing the way for an easing of restrictions in areas with low transmission of the coronavirus while keeping them in place in harder hit places trump 's decision to halt who funding condemned by scientists what you can and ca n't do during the coronavirus uk lockdown places with declining infections and strong testing would begin a three phased gradual reopening of businesses and schools which each phase lasting at least 14 days meant to ensure that the virus outbreak do not accelerate again those most susceptible to the respiratory disease would be advised to remain sheltered in place until the final phase at earliest the guidelines suggest that some parts of the country could see a resumption in normal commerce and social gatherings after a month of evaluating whether the easing of restrictions leads to a resurgence in virus cases in other parts of the country or if virus cases resume an uptick it could be substantially longer president trump briefed the nations governors on the plan on thursday afternoon saying they were going to be responsible for deciding when it is safe to lift restrictions in their states you re going to call your own shots president trump told governors according to an audio recording obtained by the associated press were going to be standing along side of you meanwhile under the federal guidelines those most susceptible to the respiratory disease would be advised to remain sheltered in place until their area enters the final phase and even then are advised to take precautions to avoid close contact with other people the federal guidelines come after seven governors in the midwest announced they will coordinate on reopening the economy after similar pacts were announced earlier this week in the west and northeast president trump held conference calls earlier on thursday with politicians he named to a new congressional advisory task force the economic costs were clear in new federal data showing that at least 22 million americans have been thrown out of work in the last month but the legislators repeatedly urged the president not to sacrifice public health in an effort to reopen the economy my highest priority on this task force will be to ensure the federal governments efforts to reopen our economy are bipartisan data driven and based on the expertise of public health professionals said democratic sen mark warner of virginia business leaders too raised concerns to the president in a round of calls on wednesday warning that a dramatic increase in testing and wider availability of protective equipment will be necessary before they can safely revive operations the federal government envisions a gradual recovery from the virus in which disruptive

number of cases in your area with our interactive map listen and subscribe to our podcast all the coronavirus information you need in one place from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus what we learned on thursday is that at least while the prime minister is convalescing the boffins of the government 's scientific advisory group for emergencies are in effect running the country dominic raab who is deputising for boris johnson made it crystal clear that he and his fellow ministers who met on thursday in cabinet and the cobra committee simply followed the advice of sage which is chaired by sir patrick vallance in extending total lockdown for a minimum of three weeks as other ministers have confirmed to me there was no pushing back on sage 's view that easing any of the current unprecedented constraints on our basic freedoms would lead to another surge in covid-19 infections that would damage health and the economy sage is the clear arbiter / adviser said a senior minister this is not government by our elected representatives as we conventionally know it and maybe given the gravity of what 's happening that is both understandable and sensible uk coronavirus death toll rises as 861 more patients die in hospital there is no issue of principle here so long as raab is on firm ground when saying that despite the massive economic costs of this lockdown there is no trade off between mortality and prosperity to consider raab said the advice from sage is that relaxing any of the measures currently in place would risk damage to both public health and our economy and that early relaxation would do more damage to the economy over a longer period which of course implies that there is no political choice here just data analysis that said what we do n't know for what it 's worth is whether there are any credible economists or any economists credible or otherwise on the committee because the membership of the committee is a secret crucial piece of covid-19 science still missing top advisor tells itv news what you can and ca n't do during the coronavirus uk lockdown i understand that treasury officials at the least feed in their views so we have to assume raab 's statement that a continued lockdown is for the best in all senses would be supported by technocrats other than the medical and epidemiological ones but it would be helpful to see the models on which these sweeping judgements are based let 's give sage the benefit of the doubt that it would be nuts to even contemplate easing any of the constraints on our freedom of movement now but what will determine when it makes sense to follow the example of most other big european countries and start setting out some kind of very long path towards more normal living raab set out five specific things which the government will need to be satisfied of before it considers it safe to to adjust any of the current measures these are 1 ministers must be confident that the nhs is no longer at risk of being overwhelmed by the virus 2 the daily death rate must have fallen in a sustained and consistent way 3 there must be reliable data from sage showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board 4 operational challenges such as ramping up the number of tests and the supply of ppe protective equipment are being met 5 and in raab 's words we need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelm the nhs what is sage and who are the experts behind the government 's covid-19 response lockdown restrictions extended for at least three more weeks at least with condition 2 there is reasonably reliable and objective data although there is some doubt about quite how many deaths in the community that are due to covid-19 are going unreported as the chief medical officer chris whitty pointed out there has been a surge in deaths well beyond those provably attributable to the coronavirus an analysis by the distinguished statistician david spiegelhalter makes the point graphically that the actual death toll from covid19 may be significantly higher than official figures show all that said it is perfectly possible to assess how many people are dying and there is quite a lot of evidence that the death rate has reached a plateau although it has certainly not fallen in any significant way but although the high death rate is traumatising it is a lagging indicator and there is much more encouraging data about numbers being admitted to hospital or to intensive care both of which are falling what about the other four tests well perhaps i am missing something but 1 3 and 5 seem to me to be saying more or less the same thing though using different words and 4 more tests for everyone and protective equipment for healthcare workers is obviously critical to all three of those near identical conditions being met they are all different ways of saying no end to lockdown until we 're sure that there wo n't be another surge of infections that would eviscerate the nhs 's capacity to save lives which is a statement of the blindingly obvious and is no help to any of us since the whole premise of the lockdown was to prevent the nhs from falling over the fundamental challenge of this virus has not changed namely that none of us can be confident of having any immunity to it because as the full scientific version of its name says it is novel or new and we ca n't be confident that we are safe to go back to normal life till we know how many of us have had it how many are immune and whether we have an effective vaccine or other therapeutic drugs so social controls of some sort or other will be with us almost certainly till well into next year because it will be months possibly well over a year till we know precisely who is at risk and who not which does not mean those social controls wo n't change progressively albeit very modestly and slowly rather sooner uk thanks key coronavirus workers with clap for our carers nhs choir 's tribute to those who gave their lives to save others the point is that vallance said he and the chief medical officer chris whitty were confident that the rate of viral transmission so called r0 is now less than 1 which is another way of saying that anyone infected will probably on average infect fewer than one other person and he said that if r0 is 0.5 that is if it would take two infected people to generate any new case sage would probably feel it was safe to have some very limited relaxation of the lockdown constraints because even if that led to some increase in transmission of the virus it would not return to being an uncontrollable epidemic the most revealing thing said today at the press conference was also by vallance and it was that he thinks the uk 's infection spread is still about four weeks behind that of italy and the point is there are small incremental relaxations of the lockdown in italy forestry work is restarting shops selling books and children 's clothes have been given permission to re - open so just possibly lumberjacks and booksellers will be able to return to work here some time in may please take that as an analogy or proxy for incredibly modest though unspecified restoration of social and economic norms but the big point is that we are being ruled by scientists and data which is not how democracies traditionally function that would be less concerning if the scientists actually had thoroughly reliable data on how many of us have had the illness and may or may not be immune they do n't and they do n't even know when that data will be available just so you know coronavirus everything you need to know check the number of cases

the uk and china ca nt have business as usual once the coronavirus crisis has passed dominic raab has said as he looked ahead to a review into the pandemic the first secretary of state speaking at the daily coronavirus press conference said in relation to china i think there absolutely needs to be a very very deep dive after the event review of the lessons he said international partners including cooperating countries and the world health organization will need to investigate how the virus came about asked about how the government will deal with china once the pandemic has passed mr raab said there s no doubt we ca nt have business as usual after this crisis well have to ask the hard questions about how it came about and how it could have been stopped earlier he said the uk can not flinch from carrying out a review into the outbreak of the virus but he added how there has been very good cooperation with the chinese since the virus started for example on the return of uk nationals at the outset from wuhan lockdown restrictions extended for at least three more weeks coronavirus which vaccines and treatments are being trialled what you can and ca n't do during the coronavirus uk lockdown so we ought to look at all sides of this and do it in a balanced way he added mr raab 's comments follow those made by one of his predecessors former foreign secretary lord hague who said it would be very good to have an international investigation to determine the origin of coronavirus the conservative peer told bbc radio 4s today programme we need international agreement for the rigorous enforcement of the closure of wildlife markets of live wildlife markets that is generally thought to be the origin of this disease he said this is an illustration of how the uk needs to work with china covid-19 is thought to have originated from an illegal wildlife market in wuhan china lord hague added but denouncing china in a nationalistic sense or withdrawing from the world health organization is absolutely not the way to go about this we are going to need structures frameworks and international cooperation to solve problems like this from now on asked whether president trump and president xi will be able to co - operate he said there s not a great hope now but that does nt mean that we should nt be working on that video report by itv news political correspondent paul brand lockdown measures to slow the spread of coronavirus in the uk will be extended for at least three more weeks foreign secretary dominic raab has said he said any change to our social distancing measures would risk a significant increase in the spread of coronavirus he said there were indications that the virus spread was slowing owing to social distancing but said a mixed and inconsistent picture meant it was still likely to be increasing in some settings the first secretary of state who is deputising for prime minister boris johnson as he recovers from coronavirus was speaking after chairing a cobra meeting with regional leaders from wales scotland and northern ireland the meeting took advice from the scientific advisory group for emergencies sage which told leaders relaxing any of the measures would risk damage to both public health and the economy mr raab said based on this advice which we have very carefully considered the government has decided that the current measures must remain in place for at least the next three weeks uk coronavirus death toll rises as 861 more patients die in hospital in pictures new coronavirus hospital opens in birmingham nec capt tom 99 completes 100th lap as nhs fundraiser passes 13 m mr raab told the government 's daily coronavirus press conference there were positive signs that social distancing was working in the uk but said large areas of society were still at risk he said he rate of infection the r0 value was almost certainly below one in the community meaning infected people were passing the disease on to fewer than one other person on average he said there are still issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and in care homes and that easing any restrictions would threaten a second peak of the virus and substantially increase the number of deaths he warned a new peak would result in a second lockdown something which would not only damage public health but would prolong the economic risks he insisted there is light at the end of the tunnel as he urged the public to keep up the social distancing measures but he refused to set a specific timetable for when restrictions would be lifted we ca nt give a definitive timeframe that would be to prejudge the evidence that would nt be a responsible thing to do mr raab said there was a five point check list of things the government would need to be sure of before restrictions could be lifted when restrictions will be lifted when there 's a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates to be confident the uk is beyond the peak once data from sage shows the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels around the country when testing capacity and ppe is sufficient enough to meet future demand when experts are confident that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak in infections when nhss ability to cope is protected and experts are confident that the nhs is able to provide sufficient critical care across the uk itv news political editor robert peston has more on the announcement labour leader sir keir starmer said he fully supports the government 's decision the priority now must be to ensure we see a ramp up in testing that staff get the ppe they desperately need and more is done to protect our care homes from the virus he said we also need clarity about what plans are being put in place to lift the lockdown when the time is right acting liberal democrat leader sir ed davey said it is absolutely right that we continue to do everything we can to reduce the transmission of this virus that means accepting the necessity for the lockdown measures to remain in place nothing could be more important right now how to social distance at the press conference mr raab also touched on the uk 's latest death figures saying it showed now is not the time to ease the restrictions stats show a total of 13,729 patients have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in the uk up by 861 from 12,868 the day before it 's believed hundreds more will have died outside hospitals in care homes hospices and other places in the community on wednesday evening health minister nadine

for emergencies sage has been thrust into the limelight as it advises the government on its response to the covid-19 pandemic but it has faced criticism for not disclosing the names of the scientists involved beyond that of its chairman chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance the group met on tuesday ahead of a decision on extending the current lockdown on thursday to find out more about it the pa news agency spoke to professor sir ian boyd about his experience of attending sage meetings in the past he was chief scientific adviser at the department of environment food and rural affairs from september 2012 to august 2019 and was involved in advising the government after the novichok poisonings in salisbury in 2018 now professor in biology at the university of st andrews he said there are dark forces that want to undermine the validity of the way science works too early to end lockdown says hancock amid calls for exit plan what is sage and how does it work the group provides scientific and technical advice to support decision makers during emergencies the make up of experts can change depending on the nature of the emergency meaning there is no membership sir ian said the objective of sage is to get the right expertise around the table to come up with a consensus view of what the answer to a particular question might be how do experts join sage sir ian explained there s a pool of experts and those people from within that pool who are relevant to a particular topic will be called on at any particular time what happens is that you get an email through or you get a calendar invite through which is a calling notice that says there s gon na be a sage at a particular time you re invited to attend and heres the agenda he added that participation is voluntary uk coronavirus death toll rises as 861 more patients die in hospital should the names of the scientific advisers be shared with the public there have been calls for sir patrick vallance to publish the names of those who have been providing advice but he has said the decision not to do so is partly motivated by safety concerns sir ian said first of all there are no members and secondly they do nt make any decisions they simply provide advice he added that there is an assumption of confidentiality and it is also important to ensure that the scientific advice and evidence is not influenced by outside sources sir ian continued there are a lot of people snake oil salesmen basically i think one could call them who would just love to get involved in that scientific process and skew it in biases in all sorts of different ways and that i m really really adamant about that one can not have a public debate about what the science is saying and what its not saying what are the dangers to the evidence being influenced?sir ian said there s an immense amount of interest outside from people who would love to get inside and change what sage is saying and that must never ever be allowed to happen otherwise the trust in the whole process will just evaporate death toll of nhs staff who contracted coronavirus rises to 27 is the way sage currently works the best way for it to work i think it is not ideal in an ideal world you d have complete transparency but its not an ideal world there s a lot of what i would call dark forces who are trying to undermine the validity of the way that science works and as a result of that sage has to be conducted in a way that makes sure that they do nt have that opportunity and its difficult and i do nt think anybody who sits on sage or chairs sage really wants it that way but on the other hand there is no real option other than to do it that way sir ian explained what are these dark forces sir ian said they are essentially people with vested interests who do not like evidence that is not in their interests he added that s not very specific and many people can fall into that category because actually a lot of our lives are not not always spent being aligned with the evidence that suggests how we should be living our lives in pictures new coronavirus hospital opens in birmingham nec coronavirus death rate twice as high for men than women we said goodbye on facetime daughter 's tribute to virus victim dad pa was told it is mainly social forces but can sometimes come from an individual challenging ways the evidence has been has been developed or particular scientific arguments it can be pretty pervasive and corrosive said the expert why has sage attracted so much attention this time around sir ian said this is more than just an interesting thing going on absolutely everybody in the country is affected by it and therefore there s a lot more interest in scrutiny in the underlying process is the government portraying the right image of sage sir ian said he always told ministers it was very dangerous for them to say i will follow the science explaining why he continued because essentially what that is doing is shifting the decision making role from them to the scientific advisers and it would be it would be better if they said i will be strongly advised by the science or something of that type because actually science is nt the only thing that we use in decision making there are lots of other factors political factors policy based factors economic factors social factors and there are international relationship factors it 's far too early for lockdown to end the health secretary has suggested ahead of a government decision on whether to extend coronavirus restrictions for a further three weeks despite signs that the uk is approaching or has passed the covid-19 peak the government is expected to agree to prolong lockdown measures when ministers meet today at wednesday evening 's coronavirus press conference it was said social distancing measures appeared to be working prompting calls for a relaxation of restrictions which were imposed more than three weeks ago on march 23 but on thursday morning matt hancock said we are seeing that peak but its still far too high and so it is too early to be making changes he was asked on good morning britain about comments made by health minister nadine dorries that lockdown restrictions should not be relaxed until a vaccine is found something that is believed to be at least a year away she said journalists should stop asking about an exit strategy she was forced to clarify her comments on twitter saying there is more than one form of lockdown and a full exit would be a gradual process mr hancock appeared to back her what nadine is saying is that this talk about an exit strategy with the idea that we go immediately back to exactly how things were before it is far too early for that he said he later told itv news nadine is right to caution that people thinking that suddenly everything will be back to exactly what it was like in january that is nt how this is going to play out the cabinet meeting comes after the number of people who have died in hospital after testing positive for covid-19 reached almost 13,000 with growing concern over increasing deaths in care homes the victims included a pregnant nurse whose baby a little girl was delivered successfully and is said to be doing well meanwhile a 99-year old military veteran who had wanted to raise 1,000 for the nhs by walking round his garden passed the 10 million mark downing street said the three week review of the lockdown regulations will go ahead as planned in line with the coronavirus legislation however ministers and officials have repeatedly made clear there is no prospect of any imminent relaxation labour leader sir keir starmer has said the party will back an extension but has called on ministers to set out an exit strategy explaining how they will eventually be lifted speaking at the daily no 10 press conference on wednesday health secretary matt hancock said there could be no let up in the efforts to curb the spread of the virus we can not let go of the hard work that has been done so far this shared sacrifice is starting to work but we will not lift these measures until it is safe to do so he said foreign secretary dominic raab standing in for prime minister boris johnson as he continues to recuperate from the disease will chair a meeting of the cabinet on thursday morning it is expected that ministers will be briefed on the latest situation by the governments chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance mr raab will then lead a meeting of the cobra civil contingencies committee when it is expected that the extension of the lockdown will be formally approved the leaders of the devolved administrations for scotland wales and northern ireland will take part by video link however even before the meeting the stormont executive announced social distancing rules would continue in northern ireland at least until may. the human cost of the epidemic was underlined with the disclosure that the latest victims of the disease included pregnant nurse mary agyeiwaa agyapong 28 who had worked on a general ward at luton and dunstable university hospital for five years her baby a girl was delivered successfully and was doing well according to the hospital according to the latest figures 12,868 patients have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in the uk as of 5 pm on tuesday up by 761 from the previous day however englands chief medical officer professor chris whitty warned of a possible bounce in the numbers when the next set of figures are released due to delays in reporting deaths over the easter weekend he said while the uk was probably reaching the peak of the epidemic the high numbers of deaths were expected to continue for a short while to come we do all think that this has flattened out but sadly we do think that high numbers of deaths will continue for a short while on from where we are at the moment he said at the moment we are not yet at the point where we can say confidently and safely this is now past the peak and we can start thinking very much about the next phases despite insisting the restrictions must remain for now ministers nevertheless are deeply conscious of the economic damage being wrought by the lockdown the office for budget responsibility warned earlier this week unemployment could rise by two million while the uk could be left with the

' like working with both hands behind your back care home boss highlights need for testing mr hancock 's comments come following the announcement that all care home residents and social care staff with covid-19 symptoms will be tested for the virus as capacity increases the government has pledged prior to the announcement only the first five symptomatic residents in a care home setting are tested to provide confirmation of whether there is an outbreak labours shadow minister for social care liz kendall has said that only 500 care staff having been tested to date and social care needs a much greater priority and focus than it has had so far increases in the laboratory capacity have opened up the chance for the government to expand testing to include all care home residents who develop symptoms the department of health and social care dhsc said testing is vital to calculating accurate infection and survival rates all of the examinations will be pcr polymerase chain reaction tests which search for the presence of covid-19 in a sample the care quality commission cqc which is coordinating testing for the care sector aims to have contacted 30,000 care providers by the end of the week it has already offered 6,000 care facilities the opportunity to test their staff care providers will then identify workers eligible for testing and refer them to their local testing centre mr hancock was also questioned about why face masks have not been made mandatory in the uk when there is some evidence which suggests infection rates are lower in countries where people wear them he said world health organisation who advice was being followed by the government the who has said it is looking into whether people should wear masks mr hancock added it 's really important to get this right because masks are globally in short supply and you 've got to make sure you use them in the right settings but also if they do n't help then it does n't improve the national effort to tackle this virus there is a review underway as you mentioned in fact i spoke to patrick vallance the uk 's chief scientific advisor about it today and it will look into where we do have these recommendations and

of labour staffers tried to stop the partys unite branch from sending letters of solidarity to the bame mps who were named in a leaked internal report as victims of racism and racial profiling from colleagues at labour hq itv news can reveal the report which was looking at the party 's handling of anti - semitism included a number of alleged examples of racism and racial profiling that had occurred in whatsapp conversations involving members of staff of the labour party i understand earlier on wednesday 100 or so labour party staff who are members of the unite union and part of the workplace unite branch held a meeting via the video conferencing service zoom to discuss how to collectively respond to the report which was leaked to the media at the weekend labour antisemitism report which top party figures worked on leaked document a motion was tabled in the meeting that said the report had highlighted damning examples of casual workplace racism at the most senior levels of the party and it illustrates how the racism faced by black asian and minority ethnic members were ignored it also called for letters of solidarity to be sent to the three bame mps diane abbott dawn butler and clive lewis who were mentioned specifically in the report as being on the receiving end of the racism and racial profiling during the meeting some labour party staffers objected to this and an amendment was tabled to stop the letters of solidarity being sent out one labour staffer who is mentioned in the report in reference to these allegations argued against it happening and said that it served as an implication of guilt i m told this attempt to block the letters was only supported by a handful of people and was swiftly rejected some labour staffers also spoke out against the motion in its entirety throughout the meeting and one source described the discussions as shocking and incredibly tense the motion was passed with just over a dozen labour staffers either voting against or abstaining one source said bame colleagues in particular were upset about the meeting and counted that one person who was against the motion interrupted colleagues on more than 25 occasions another source told me this was a straight forward motion that was designed to condemn the racism that was seen in the report many people are now very upset about the hostility in the response to that now that the motion has passed the unite branch of the labour party will be sending the letters of solidarity the scientific advisory group for emergencies sage has been thrust into the limelight as it advises the government on its response to the covid-19 pandemic the evidence produced by this body of scientists public health workers and academics has helped shaped government policy during the coronavirus crisis and by extension your life but what is sage who is it made up of and just how does it inform the governments response to covid-19 itv news spoke to experts who gave us the lowdown on how this advisory body works who are the experts advising the government how to ease lockdown what is sage essentially sage is the emergency group for science the science cobr if you like while it does not make decisions the current coronavirus picture is informed by what comes out of sage it brings together expertise from across the scientific spectrum including epidemiologists clinical and vaccine experts forecasting and modellers who feed their research and data into sage sages role is to provide consensus recommendations on all the key issues based on this body of scientific evidence presented by its members this includes everything from how a potential covid-19 vaccine is progressing to school closures the usefulness of face masks and compliance these informed recommendations are then passed on to government ministers and decision makers to help guide the response to covid-19 science editor tom clarke university of oxford team in race to find working coronavirus vaccine how might we know when uk coronavirus deaths have peaked how often does it meet since the beginning of january sage has met every tuesday and thursday who is in sage sage comprises of leading lights in their representative fields from across the worlds of academia public health and science they do not operate under government instruction and membership changes based on the expertise needed to address the crisis the country is faced with to make things slightly more complicated sage is made up of a series of subcommittees as well as ad hoc subject specific groups that are called upon as needed in a letter to the chair of the science and technology select committee greg clark at the beginning of april chief scientific advisor sir patrick vallance said members of sage and the expert groups came from over 20 different institutions who in turn considered research and papers from other many sources including the covid-19 genomic uk consortium imperial college london london school of hygiene and tropical medicine manchester epidemic group and many academic clinical and other groups typically sage is chaired by the government chief scientific advisor at present this is sir patrick or a departmental chief scientific advisor the government had been criticised for not officially disclosing the names of some sage members with campaigners demanding transparency over how coronavirus decisions are made bowing to pressure a list revealing some of the members of the group was released by the government on may 4 many of the names are already familiar to the public as they stand either side of a government minister at the daily downing street briefing including england 's chief medical officer professor chris whitty his deputies dr jenny harries and professor jonathan van tam and public health england medical director professor yvonne doyle think you might have covid-19 here are the symptoms does the government have to listen to sages advice the government is not absolutely beholden to what sage says but the combined weight of all that knowledge which has been referred to as like having google in the room makes their expertise highly valuable to the government the evidence sage puts forward is also just one part of what the government considers before adopting new policies and interventions during an emergency in this current pandemic the government also has to consider other factors such as the likelihood of social unrest and the impact on the economy andinternational relationship factors in some instances however it can have a momentous and immediate influence on government policy a team at imperial college london led by professor neil ferguson produced a landmark report in march stating that if the uk was not put on lockdown 250,000 people would die due to coronavirus the paper was enough to persuade prime minister boris johnson to abandon his less stringent response and announce a full scale lockdown for the country on march 23 can i read what goes on at a sage meeting some of the sub - committees currently do publish minutes and the plan is to publish sage minutes in more detail at the end of the emergency but according to our source there is too much highly sensitive material in these documents for them to be published at the present time the government is however publishing the scientific evidence supporting the states response to covid-19 there s currently one batch of evidence available online and a second batch is due to be published soon what data do they weigh up relating to the lockdown and the spread of the virus despite all the different groups individuals and committees that make up sage it does for the most part reach a consensus agreement they are after all acting on evidence when considering next steps the experts will look at the current situation the number of coronavirus infections and deaths for example this is called now casting they will also look at forecasting based on models and sage will also action research if the data is pointing towards something that has not been explored sage will commission research to fully understand the extent of an issue and get a full clinical picture for example the benefit or not of wearing face masks face masks should i wear one what 's the advice and how do they work when has sage been activated before the coronavirus crisis is not the first time sage has been called on there are eight emergencies in the last 11 years since its inception when the government has sought expert scientific advice sage was last activated in response to the potential breach of toddbrook reservoir in whaley bridge in august 2019 a precautionary sage known as pre - sage was activated to advise on the zika virus outbreak in 2016 in 2015 sage was activated to advise on the nepal earthquake and in 2014 it was called in response to the ebola outbreak in west africa sage also advised on winter flooding in the uk in 2013 the japan nuclear incident

hospital could not be visited by relatives matt hancock said he was announcing new procedures because wanting to be with someone you love at the end of their life is one of the deepest human instincts

coronavirus latest your daily one minute update from itv news despite chief medical officer chris whitty saying the uk is probably reaching the peak of the outbreak mr hancock hinted that coronavirus restrictions will not be relaxed tomorrow he said we can not let up in our efforts we can not let go of the hard work that s been done so far this shared sacrifice and i know its a sacrifice is starting to work but we will not lift these measures until it is safe to do so professor whitty said while signs were positive he warned after a long four day weekend there may well be a bounce tomorrow he said the spread of infection appeared to have flattened out but sadly we do think that high numbers of deaths will continue for a short while prof whitty reiterated at the moment we are not yet at the point where we can say confidently and safely this is now past the peak and we can start thinking very much about the next phases face masks what 's the advice and how do they work how might we know when uk coronavirus deaths have peaked mr hancock also announced a new single brand with a badge for care workers which he said may help them access similar perks to nhs staff this badge will be a badge of honour in a very real sense allowing social care staff proudly and publicly to identify themselves just like nhs staff do with that famous blue and white logo i know that many businesses will want to offer the same recognition and benefits as they do wonderfully to the nhs he said supermarkets had been asked to give the same priority access to care workers as nhs staff he also said there was a plan to strengthening our national recruitment campaign with the aim of recruiting tens of thousands of people into social care mr hancock said the government will pay for people 's initial induction training he made the pledges after it was revealed about 1,000 residents had died after outbreaks at at least 2,000 care homes at one facility there have been at least 13 fatalities pregnant nurse dies after positive virus test but baby is saved the health secretary said he said he was determined to ensure that everyone needing a test should have access to one with testing remaining a key part of the governments coronavirus battle plan but questions have been raised as to how the government will offer tests to everyone who needs one when it failed to meet its own target of 25,000 tests per day by mid - april in the 24 hours up to 9 am on tuesday just 14,982 tests were carried out despite there being capacity for 19,000 but mr hancock said the government was still working toward its target of 100,000 per day by the end of the month were building capacity of testing all the time he said and as we build capacity further over this month and then beyond to that 100,000 a day target by the end of this month well expand further those who are eligible for tests all as part of the plan to get a hold of this virus and make sure that we support the key public services that we need as this moment there are also concerns over why it has taken so long to make the commitment with the government knowing for some time that elderly people were among the most vulnerable to coronavirus mr hancock admitted one of the first things discovered about covid-19 was that the elderly were badly affected by the disease therefore it was clear that especially for care settings supporting older people and its also true for care settings that support people of working age we were going to have to have a particular focus he said protective gear being washed and reused as stocks run out target of 25,000 virus tests per day by mid - april is missed deputy chief scientific adviser dame angela mclean said there was a huge question about how to protect care homes which do not yet have cases care home providers have also been raising concerns around protective equipment for staff with many procuring their own gear to get around shortages earlier the chief executive of optima care who looks after 14 care homes told itv news that running his business without testing is like trying to do your job with both hands behind your back he said without testing staff are unable to know whether they 're safe to work with vulnerable residents he also highlighted problems he 's been facing with ppe the general themes that are coming across are just the pure lack of ppe equipment there 's a lot of individual providers having to resort to local and very innovative ways to self fabricate or acquire through various different sources it 's a very time consuming process especially when we 're trying to maintain a level of confidence and safety for the staff we 're asking to come to work on a daily basis and expose themselves to risk the government has failed to meet its own target of carrying out 25,000 coronavirus tests per day by mid - april falling short by more than 5,000 in the 24 hours up to 9 am on tuesday just 14,982 tests were carried out despite there being capacity for 19,000 boris johnson 's spokesman has said he claimed testing capacity is increasing all of the time and that the 100,000-tests a day target by the end of the month remained in place but at the start of april housing secretary robert jenrick set a target of 25,000 a day by the middle of the month we think within days we will be able to go from our present capacity of 12,750 to 15,000 so that 's a significant increase but still not as far as we 'd like it to be then mid - april is when we expect to be at 25,000 he told sky news protective gear being washed and reused as stocks run out two arrested on suspicion of selling fake coronavirus testing kits ' covid-19 test pledge for all who needs one in care settings with 30 days in april the 15th of the month is the mid - way point yet the target has still not been reached despite failing to reach the previous target the prime minister 's spokesman said the overall commitment remains the same which is to achieve 100,000 tests by the end of the month earlier health secretary matt hancock said he was determined to ensure that everyone needing a test should have access to one with testing remaining a key part of the governments coronavirus battle plan mr hancock said i am deeply conscious that people in residential care are among the most vulnerable to coronavirus we are doing everything we can to keep workers residents and their families safe we have already begun testing social care workers and will roll this out nationwide over the coming days and as we continue to ramp up our testing programme we will test all current care home residents with coronavirus symptoms and all new care home residents who are discharged from hospital into care meanwhile two people were arrested by fraud detectives on suspicion of selling fake coronavirus testing kits officers arrested a 46-year old pharmacist from croydon south london and seized around 20,000 he was arrested for allegedly making false and misleading claims about the tests capability in another investigation a 39-year old surveyor from uxbridge west london was stopped while driving his car officers found 250 coronavirus testing kits he was also arrested for making misleading claims about the capability of the tests he told investigators he was planning on selling the kits to construction workers he was

his garden mr raab is deputising for prime minister boris johnson as he recovers from coronavirus downing street said the uk was not planning to follow the us in withholding funds from the world health organization who us president donald trump says the who failed in its basic duty to stop the virus spreading when it was first reported in china and must be held accountable the us gave 900 million dollars 720 million to the who in the year 2018 2019 a fifth of its total budget for that year donald trump condemned for dangerous move to halt payments to world health organisation mr trump said he would be putting a hold on all funds going to world health during an evaluation period he says will last between 60 and 90 days the prime ministers official spokesman said our position is that the uk has no plans to stop funding the who which has an important role to play in leading the global health response coronavirus is a global challenge and its essential that countries work together to tackle this shared threat asked if the government was disappointed by mr trumps move the spokesman said i can only set out the uks position and that is we have no plans to stop funding the who labour leader sir keir starmer has urged the government to publish its exit strategy from the covid-19 lockdown this week in a letter to dominic raab who is deputising for boris johnson sir keir confirmed that labour would support the government if as is expected it extends the lockdown later this week but he said the question for thursday therefore is no longer about whether the lockdown should be extended but about what the governments position is on how and when it can be eased in due course and on what criteria that decision will be taken ministers have argued that now is not the time to talk about this i profoundly disagree overcoming this crisis requires taking the british public with you labour demands government meeting to resume parliament coronavirus testing should have been ramped up quicker says keir starmer sir keir told itv news the government needs to keep the public 's trust by telling them what is happening regarding the lockdown the demand i have made about the exit strategy is intended to be constructive because i genuinely think that to ensure we have the trust of the public and the planning is in place decisions have to be made now he said we have asked a lot of the public over the past three months and they 've given a lot it 's been very very hard for people we need to keep their trust and they need to know broadly speaking what will happen next now is the right time as the plans have to be put in place he said a vaccine for the virus is about 12 months away so people want to know what will happen in the period before it is made available that is a question they are entitled to an answer for not precise timings but what 's the broad thinking and what are the options that you think are viable and what 's the planning going behind them he added sir keir also questioned what the priorities would be once the lockdown is eased and whether schools would be the first to open as there 's growing concern in the equality between children getting good home schooling and those that are not sir keir warned in his letter to mr raab the silent pressures on communities across the uk can not be underestimated and said that to maintain morale and hope people need a sense of what comes next the labour leader wrote many will be struggling with their mental health others with how they will make ends meet for others the challenge will be loneliness and separation from loved ones illness or losing to this terrible disease sir keir wrote he urged mr raab to commit to setting out the criteria the government will use to inform how and when it intends to ease the lockdown to publish the exit strategy now or in the coming week and to outline the sectors and core public services that are most likely to see restrictions eased labours call comes as the government faces mounting pressure to set out how and when it plans to lift the covid-19 lockdown restrictions no precise strategy has yet been announced a government source said our strategy is focused on saving lives we have been clear that all decisions will be guided by the scientific advice and data talk of an exit strategy before we have reached the peak

pointed to the obr prediction that the economy should bounce back peston forecaster says virus economic shock worst in 100 years about 1,000 coronavirus care home deaths says minister itv news business and economics editor joel hills explains the potential economic impact we came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the british people and british businesses so while those economic impacts are significant the obr also expects them to be temporary with a bounceback in growth he said the government 's response to the virus aims to directly support people and businesses while restrictions are in place so they can get moving again as soon as restrictions are lifted he said the obr predicts the uk 's economic situation would be much worse had protective measures not been taken in other words our plan is the right plan he added but he admitted mistakes were likely to have been made during the high pressure situation when you are faced with such an unprecedented challenge are we going to be absolutely perfect in every single thing we do at the pace we are having to do it of course not he said but they were doing what we think is in the best interests of the country and people and would be making improvements where necessary the main points from the obr report national income or gdp falling by 35 % in the second

died with coronavirus in uk hospitals an increase of 778 from the day before professor stephen powis the national medical director of nhs england pointed to a possible levelling in the number of new hospital admissions he said there was increasing evidence now that the number of hospital admissions is stabilising and plateauing in london and other areas but he warned the public not to become complacent he told the downing street press conference that lockdown compliance levels among the public are very high but said we need to keep it that way we absolutely need to make sure that we keep the benefits of this going forward and we do nt take a foot off the pedal we do nt become complacent he said testing figures suggested a plateauing in the number of new cases being picked up though cautioned that not everyone who is symptomatic in the community is tested he added we are beginning to see the benefits of the undoubted hardship that we have all been asked to go through in terms of social distancing in terms of not meeting with friends and family its really important that those benefits are maintained that we continue to follow the instructions that we have all been given and we will then get on top of this virus chancellor sunak told the press conference right now the single most important thing we can do for the health of our economy is to protect the health of our people following reports of cabinet rifts over the potential length of the lockdown and the economic damage that it will cause mr sunak said it is not a case of choosing between the economy and public health

a time when we are seeing hundreds of people dying every day from this terrible disease the absolute priority must be to focus all of our resources not just of the state but of businesses and all of

national debt as a percentage of gdp will rise a staggering almost unprecedented 30 percentage points of gdp over three years this is equivalent to a rise in the national debt of 600bn to be clear the obr may well be erring on the side of optimism because for now it is assuming no lasting economic hit that the economy will recover relatively quickly when the the pandemic is under control and the lockdown measures are being eased this is an assumption that it accepts will have to be revisited ps it would be remiss of me not to point out that the obr expects this economic shock to be the sharpest and worst in the uk for 100 years chancellor rishi sunak said the report makes it clear the coronavirus outbreak will have a very significant impact on our economy about 1,000 coronavirus care home deaths says minister care regulator to record care home deaths from coronavirus how can ministers prevent furloughed staff being sacked in three months video report by itv news political correspondent paul brand the government is being urged to record all coronavirus related care home deaths after it was revealed there had been about 1,000 resident fatalities labour leader sir keir

today care home workers and relatives ' anguish in battle against coronavirus coronavirus death toll airbrushing out older people dying in care system the latest figures released by the office for national statistics ons which showed significant disparity in the government 's death toll compared with that of the ons during the government 's coronavirus press conference chancellor rishi sunak said there 's absolutely no desire to omit care home deaths from daily figures he said there was a logistical challenge in gathering such data quickly after it was revealed on monday that 2,099 care homes had been hit by outbreaks of coronavirus the ons said of the 406 covid-19-related deaths which occurred outside hospitals in the week up to april 3 217 took place in care homes labour leader sir keir said on twitter the government should include these figures in its daily reporting because care homes are on the front line of this crisis director of health protection for public health england professor yvonne doyle said i would very much like to have the best possible data on a daily basis she added we have a number of outbreaks in care homes and there is very active input there to ensure that the damage and the harm to people is mitigated so we work very actively with the care home sector but it is a very dispersed sector itv news political correspondent paul brand who has been investigating the impact of coronavirus on care homes said between two care home providers he had spoken to there had been 521 resident deaths care provider hc one reported 311 deaths and mha reported 210 paul brand visited eighton lodge care home in gateshead where care workers told him they have cried a lot recently jean hutchinson who 's 90-years old died in the hospital with covid-19 her death will be included in the government 's daily statistics meanwhile 81-year old eddie hall died in the care home so his death has not been included in the government 's statistics alison bolden a care worker at gateshead told itv news when i think about them they 're just good memories otherwise i just cry a lot i 've cried quite a lot over the last two weeks when paul brand asked the care home manager laura simpson what is upsetting her she said because we have a duty of care to the residents and i just feel like the virus is just wiping people out and it 's really really hard to watch she added that she does n't feel like she is getting help from the government one care home manager anita astle told itv news her staff members are broken there have been nine coronavirus related deaths at her care home in nottinghamshire so far and with each death it 's getting harder to do what were doing of her staff ms astle said they re broken they re raw its unprecedented times and its really hard we 're seeing people die prematurely and that s really hard to watch care homes have become an area of growing concern after 13 residents at one facility died following an outbreak downing street rejected suggestions that care home residents and staff were being treated as second class citizens during the outbreak i do nt accept that at all the prime minister 's spokesperson said we are working around the clock to ensure that every vulnerable person young or old gets the support they need during this crisis ms coffey also said care homes are being provided with the right equipment to properly care for residents she said care home providers are able to access ppe equipment from wholesalers and others who are not discriminating between social care or local nhs care but we will continue to make sure they are part of aspects of the delivery network the prime minister 's spokesperson added we have delivered 7.8 million pieces of ppe to over 26,000 care settings no wholesaler is prioritising the nhs over the care sector shadow chancellor anneliese dodds told itv news it would be helpful if the government started publishing the number of people who have passed away in care homes from coronavirus care regulator to record care home deaths from covid-19 the forgotten frontline care home workers and relatives ' anguish worldwide coronavirus cases near two million we think it would be very useful for the sector when workers are doing their very best to care for very unwell people in very difficult circumstances ms dodds said the latest figures released by the office for national statistics showed of all deaths which occurred in england and wales up to april 3 registered up to april 11 6,235 involved covid-19 that compares with 4,093 deaths reported by the government

all mentions of covid-19 on a death certificate including suspected cases as well as deaths in the community the nhs figures only include deaths in hospitals where a patient has been tested for

condition did worsen over the course of last monday afternoon and he had to be moved to the intensive care unit now clearly if a person is moved to intensive care that means that they are requiring a significant level of specialist treatment so i think it was clear from the moment the prime minister was moved to intensive care that his condition had worsened mr johnson hailed the medics who looked after him at st thomas and said without question the nhs had saved his life in an emotional speech posted on social media following his hospital release the prime minister it could have gone either way and praised two nurses who stayed by his side for 48 hours coronavirus prime minister boris johnson 's easter sunday message in full one of the nurses jenny mcgee said it was a surreal time as she

our nhs is the beating heart of this country it is the best of this country it is unconquerable it is powered by love his comments came as it was confirmed the number of those who had died in uk hospitals after contracting covid-19 had breached the 10,000 mark in what mr hancock called a sombre moment for the country sir jeremy farrar director of the wellcome trust told the bbcs andrew marr show that the uk looked set to have one of the worst if not the worst death rate in europe the formal review of the strict social distancing measures is due as per the emergency powers legislation to be reviewed by ministers on thursday it is not known whether mr johnson will be well enough to take part in those discussions the 55-year old praised the countrys efforts in following the tough social distancing rules over the easter weekend and said the measures were proving their worth in protecting the nhs downing street said it would only look to lift restrictions once science and medical

asked about the niesr report told the marr show there would no doubt be economic repercussions following the lockdown measures there is no doubt there is going to be a short term impact in terms of

check the number of cases in your area with our interactive map listen and subscribe to our podcast all the coronavirus information you need in one place from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus the stories i hear from what healthcare workers call the frontline code for those working directly with covid-19 patients are traumatising i am seeing scores of death says one senior doctor it 's hideous i'm palliating giving temporary relief to people in their 70s-90s on the wards who were never remotely suitable for intensive care and who are dying horribly quickly and nastily too if they do n't get the proper care the ward staff do n't have the experience and the poor patients do n't have a loved one by their side acting as their advocate this doctor gave me this insight because i could not work out where precisely people were dying since it was clear from the statistics on use of itu or intensive care wards that the majority are not dying there as this doctor pointed out significant numbers of people with covid-19 are too frail or have too many co - morbidities life threatening conditions to withstand itu so their ceiling of care is ward based to hear this is not a great surprise though it is upsetting the point is that what we hear about in the media tends to be the shocking deaths of younger people in intensive care much less attention is paid to the elderly and frail who are dying in horrifyingly large numbers on nhs wards and in care homes twelfth care home resident dies following outbreak of coronavirus at facility sombre day as uk 's coronavirus death toll passes 10,000 pm praises ' unconquerable nhs as he 's discharged from hospital i am acutely aware of this differentiated treatment because an elderly relative was put on a ward after being diagnosed with covid-19 and has since died whereas two younger friends have been in itu so when the prime minister says his life was saved by being admitted to intensive care and being ministered to round the clock by two nurses jenny from new zealand and luis from portugal this is compelling but half the story he should thank his lucky stars he caught this awful virus when relatively strong and young i am labouring these points because a growing number of us are experiencing the anxiety and grief of close proximity to this potentially lethal illness and this grief makes many of us increasingly impatient to understand why so many british people are dying mortalities in the uk by the time the epidemic has run its course are likely to exceed those in other european countries based on current trends so says the distinguished director of the wellcome trust sir jeremy farrar who is advising government on how to contain the epidemic when pressed on why the incidence of death may be disproportionately great as health secretary matt hancock was today in the daily press conference the response was that our covid-19 destiny is in our collective hands namely that there will be fewer deaths if we religiously adhere to the rules that prevent us mingling with those outside our respective households nurses told to refuse work if adequate ppe can not be provided coronavirus uk could be worst affected country in europe i probably was n't alone in feeling uneasy at the apparent suggestion that there was nothing government had done wrong or could do better but as non - answers go it was at least a practical non - answer but of course it contains within it the seeds of a genuine answer it implies that if only the government had forced social distancing on us days and weeks earlier as happened in ireland and denmark for example the rates of infection and death here would have been suppressed earlier too that said a lag in the enforcement of social distancing is n't the whole explanation for why proportionately more people may be dying here than in say germany as chief medical officer chris whitty has said to me another cause may be that the uk had less capacity than germany to test those with symptoms fewer tests would lead to a higher mortality rate because inadequate data on precisely who has the virus would also feed through to less contact tracing of anyone who 'd been in close proximity in preceding days to those infected my medical friends are also jealous of the quality and resources of german hospitals now the point of this kind of analysis is not to apportion blame in a conventional political way it is to rebuild hope that the correct approach is being taken by the government now since we are going to be asked to sacrifice very basic freedoms to keep the virus at bay for many months and possibly years it is all very well to say the priority must be to look forward not back but if our leaders can demonstrate a bit more backbone by admitting what they misunderstood hitherto we might all have a bit more confidence in our collective future in the current dire circumstances the stock response of politicians and officials which is to pretend it 's all been going to plan is not only inappropriate but may also be dangerous prime minister boris johnson has sent an easter sunday message to the nation thanking the nhs for saving his life after he was discharged from hospital following three nights in intensive care at st thomas ' hospital as he was treated for coronavirus the prime minister shared a video message from his country residence chequers where he will spend his recovery here is the prime minister 's message in full good afternoon i have today left hospital after a week in which the nhs has saved my life no question its hard to find the words to express my debt but before i come to that i want to thank everyone in the entire uk for the effort and the sacrifice you have made and are making when the sun is out and the kids are at home when the whole natural world seems at its loveliest and the outdoors is so inviting i can only imagine how tough it has been to follow the rules on social distancing i thank you because so many millions and millions of people across this country have been doing the right thing millions going through the hardship of self isolation faithfully patiently with thought and care for others as well as for themselves i want you to know that this easter sunday i do believe that your efforts are worth it and are daily proving their worth because although we mourn every day those who are taken from us in such numbers and though the struggle is by no means over we are now making progress in this incredible national battle against coronavirus a fight we never picked against an enemy we still do nt entirely understand we are making progress in this national battle because the british public formed a human shield around this countrys greatest national asset our national health service sombre day as uk 's coronavirus death toll passes 10,000 pm praises ' unconquerable nhs as he 's discharged from hospital rees mogg signals no early recall of parliament on the cards we understood and we decided that if together we could keep our nhs safe if we could stop our nhs from being overwhelmed then we could not be beaten and this country would rise together and overcome this challenge as we have overcome so many challenges in the past in the last seven days i have of course seen the pressure that the nhs is under i have seen the personal courage not just of the doctors and nurses but of everyone the cleaners the cooks the health care workers of every description physios radiographers pharmacists who have kept coming to work kept putting themselves in harms way kept risking this deadly virus it is thanks to that courage that devotion that duty and that love that our nhs has been unbeatable i want to pay my own thanks to the utterly brilliant doctors leaders in their fields men and women but several of them for some reason called nick who took some crucial decisions a few days ago for which i will be grateful for the rest of my life i want to thank the many nurses men and women whose care has been so astonishing i am going to forget some names so forgive me but i want to thank po ling and shannon and emily and angel and connie and becky and rachael and nicky and ann and i hope they wo nt mind if i mention in particular two nurses who stood by my bedside for 48 hours when things could have gone either way they are jenny from new zealand invercargill on the south island to be exact and luis from portugal near porto justin welby praises ' heroism of nhs in virtual easter service 135,000 sign petition to scrap mps 10,000 work from home fund all the covid-19 information and advice you need in one place and the reason in the end my body did start to get enough oxygen was because for every second of the night they were watching and they were thinking and they were caring and making the interventions i needed so that is how i also know that across this country 24 hours a day for every second of every hour there are hundreds of thousands of nhs staff who are acting with the same care and thought and precision as jenny and luis that is why we will defeat this coronavirus and defeat it together we will win because our nhs is the beating heart of this country it is the best of this country it is unconquerable it is powered by love so thank you from me and from all of us to the nhs and lets remember to follow the rules on social distancing stay at home protect our nhs and save lives thank you and happy easter video report by itv news political correspondent david wood easter sunday marks a sombre day in the uk 's battle with coronavirus health secretary matt hancock has said after the covid-19-related death toll was revealed to be over 10,000 mr hancock was leading the government 's daily coronavirus update while his boss prime minister boris johnson recovers from covid-19 at chequers his countryside retreat after returning from hospital following three nights in intensive care he gave an update on mr johnson 's health saying he is continuing his recovery shortly after mr johnson posted a video to twitter thanking the nhs for saving my life but he did not reveal when the pm would return to work saying that would be a decision for his doctors mr hancock said the government was working very hard to ensure ppe was available to all health care workers after it was revealed on saturday that 19 nhs staff members had died after contracting coronavirus he claimed there are now record amounts in the system but said until everyone gets the ppe they need then we wo nt rest mr hancock said it was an enormous effort to provide all staff with necessary protective equipment nurses told to refuse work if adequate ppe can not be provided pm praises ' unconquerable nhs as he 's discharged from hospital he said experts were currently trying to source more protective gowns of which 121,000 had recently been delivered around the country mr hancock said that he wanted to be transparent about operational challenges and paid tribute to health and medical staff on streets front doors and balconies up and down the country we ve seen the esteem with which our whole nation holds our carers those who make the nhs and social care what it is he said we owe it to them to get them what they need despite issues with ppe mr hancock said the nhs was managing the crisis better than other countries saying it had always been able to provide the very best of care to everybody who needs it he reassured the public on the health service 's ability to deal with the virus saying there is now more spare capacity now for critical care than there was when coronavirus first hit our shores health care systems around the world have been overwhelmed by the virus he said but not here the latest figures show that in great britain we have 2,295 spare critical care beds up 150 from yesterday he added and he said the uk 's capacity was to increase further with the building of more temporary coronavirus field hospitals around the country six more temporary nightingale hospitals are being built across england after the first in london opened he said he said the critical expansion is partly because we have a record number of ventilators 9,775 in the system and partly because we have record numbers of returners coming back and rejoining the nhs over 5,000 former staff are now back on the nhs frontline and over 36,000 have come forward to enlist he said he added throughout this crisis with all the challenges that we 've been dealing with all the operational difficulties and all the logistics we have always been able to provide the very best of care to everybody who needs it through the nhs justin welby praises ' heroism of nhs in virtual easter service rees mogg signals no early recall of parliament on the cards at the start of this crisis people said that the nhs would be overwhelmed and we 've seen that and we 've seen the risk of that elsewhere but not here and that is because of the action that a huge number of people are taking and the incredible work of so many mr hancock also announced a new nhs app for coronavirus contact tracing he said if someone is experiencing symptoms of covid-19 they can tell this new nhs app and the app will then send an alert anonymously to other app users that you ve been in significant contact with over the past few days even before you have symptoms so that they know and can act accordingly he said the app is currently being tested and they are working with the worlds leading tech companies and experts in clinical safety and digital ethics so that we can get this right prime minister johnson in his video message on twitter said the uk will win the battle against coronavirus because our nhs is the beating heart of this country it is unconquerable it is powered by love but he said his stay at st thomas ' hospital 's intensive care ward could have gone either way and he was being watched every second of the night by nhs staff mr hancock said there was no advice on how long prime minister johnson should rest before returning to work he added that will be a clinical decision for his doctors to take with him the government is operating perfectly efficiently within the strategy that he set out at the press conference mr hancock also thanked the nhs as he urged the public to stick with the government 's coronavirus lockdown measures pointing to the uk 's high death toll he said today marks a sombre day in the impact of this disease as we join the list of countries who have seen more than 10,000 deaths related to coronavirus the fact that over 10,000 people have now lost their lives to this invisible killer demonstrates just how serious this coronavirus is and why the national effort that everyone is engaged in is so important a total of 10,612 patients have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus as of 5 pm saturday the department of health said earlier meanwhile labour demanded urgent talks with the government to discuss how parliament can be reopened ahead of schedule to allow the coronavirus response to be scrutinised after it was closed for an early easter recess amid the growing coronavirus crisis but commons leader jacob rees mogg appears to be resisting such calls he is insisting mps will return on april 21 the date agreed before the easter recess a

agreed before the easter recess mps approved the easter adjournment timings on march 25 minutes before the chamber rose at a time when the increasing impact of covid-19 was clear the motion was

week it is important that we have a comprehensive solution that does not inadvertently exclude any members the leader of the house of commons will respond to the leader of the oppositions letter in the usual way it is unclear whether a small group of mps will still attend the chamber after recess with others allowed to question ministers from their homes by webcam work has been commissioned by sir lindsay to ensure a virtual chamber can be up and running after the easter recess so mps can return to duty mps and peers are required to be physically present to walk through voting lobbies when passing legislation with proxy voting allowed in some circumstances but the speaker has indicated exceptions could be made to ensure parliament can function during the pandemic before the recess

petition calling for mps to be stripped of their 10,000 work from home allowance mps have been offered an additional 10,000 each by the independent parliamentary standards authority ipsa the body that audits expenses of those in the commons to pay for increased costs as they and their staff move to working from home during the covid-19 lockdown but some have expressed distaste at the decision to give mps more funding while employees in the uk face being furloughed at 80 % pay and others have lost their jobs due to the impact of coronavirus as of 8.30am on sunday 135,192 people had signed the petition a rejection of the mps 10000 corona virus working from home allowance on the change.org website labour demands government meeting to resume parliament lucy pearson who started the petition wrote while the rest of us lesser mortals struggle to pay bills navigate hmrc and for many learn they are not entitled to any support whatsoever during these dark times already financially stable mps are being given yet another perk the extra budget can be used to buy equipment such as laptops and printers for mps and their staff or to cover additional electricity heating and phone bills the money which comes on top of the existing office budget of about 26,000 a year per mp will be available until next march this petition is an opportunity for all of us to unite and to tell those in power that we ve had enough of the gross inequalities that exist in this country commons speaker sir lindsay hoyle previously said it was incorrect to describe the as mps handing themselves extra cash in a time of emergency it is wrong to characterise this extra 10,000 allocated by ipsa as mps giving themselves additional funds he said tributes paid to three more nurses as nhs death toll rises on the contrary this money is being used to enable mps staff to set up home working to support distressed constituents at a time of crisis many mps have seen their casework soar as a direct result of coronavirus enabling staff to work remotely is the best and the safest way for them and the constituents they are in contact with to communicate and work together during these difficult times the additional budget is there to draw down on if it is needed and required and it will have to be accounted for in the usual way ipsa set up in the wake of the expenses scandal said most mps moved at very short notice from being based in westminster or in a constituency office to working from home many staff were not set up for home working nor for supporting constituents remotely this additional funding is to help them make that transition while they deal with a huge increase in workload from distressed constituents as a result of coronavirus issues the petition follows renewed demands for parliament to open again for business on april 21 as scheduled after its four week easter break home secretary priti patel said she did not know if mps would return as planned but new labour leader sir keir starmer has demanded a meeting with the government next week to ensure questions can be put to ministers about their handling of the covid-19 crisis new labour leader sir keir starmer has demanded urgent talks with the government to ensure mps can probe ministers over their handling of the coronavirus crisis close to 10,000 people have died in uk hospitals since the outbreak started and sir keir who replaced jeremy corbyn as opposition leader last week said the commons must be open for business after easter even if it means mps asking questions over webcams in a letter to commons leader jacob rees mogg sir keir wrote parliament has a responsibility to put questions to ministers at this time of national crisis the best decisions are those that are challenged and subject to scrutiny and by that process issues can be resolved mistakes quickly rectified and individual concerns addressed which will help save lives and protect our country but if parliament is not sitting or functioning effectively that can not happen how can government govern without a prime minister the former director of prosecutions for the crown prosecution service said labour supported many of the measures implemented by the government but set out a list of questions that need to be answered he called for clarity over an exit strategy from the lockdown imposed on the uk along with answers over the ramping up of testing for covid-19 and the supply of personal protective equipment ppe for frontline nhs staff the 57-year old has requested a meeting with mr rees mogg and commons speaker sir lindsay hoyle next week to discuss parliament resuming on april 21 so such questions can be put to ministers directly who is in sir keir starmers shadow cabinet his letter comes after home secretary priti patel told reporters during a downing street briefing that she did not know yet whether the commons would meet as planned in little over a weeks time sir keir added i am writing to request urgent talks with you and the speaker of the house this week about how we can guarantee the return of parliament after the easter recess i accept that it is difficult for parliament to return to business as usual at the moment but there are clear examples around the world of parliaments operating effectively by using new technologies and different models work has been commissioned by mr hoyle to ensure a virtual chamber can be up and running after the easter recess so mps can return to duty it could see mps questioning ministers from their homes by webcam if the lockdown is still in place with senior ministers signalling there is no intention to curb the social distancing measures the palace of westminster currently requires mps and peers to be physically present to walk through voting lobbies when passing legislation but the speaker has indicated exceptions could be made to ensure parliament can function during the pandemic video report by itv news correspondent romilly weeks home

shores that not enough ppe was being made available to health workers especially those working in social care hancock 19 nhs workers have died in coronavirus pandemic junior doctors at london hospital hit out at inadequate masks and ppe ms patel fielding questions at a downing street briefing on saturday said she was sorry if people felt there had been failings regarding the supply of ppe after being asked twice if she would apologise to nhs staff and their families over the lack of necessary ppe ms patel said i m sorry if people feel that there have been failings i will be very very clear about that but at the same time we are in an unprecedented global health pandemic right now doctor abdul mabud chowdhury who issued warning over lack of ppe dies after contracting covid-19 ' one in a million nhs nurse aimee gave her life to save others friends say it is inevitable that the demand and the pressures on ppe and demand for ppe are going to be exponential they are going to be incredibly high and of course we are trying to address that as a government police have also revealed that 1,084 fines have been issued for breaches of coronavirus regulations in england and wales

coronavirus outbreak it is feared there will be an increase in domestic abuse the home secretary said that people who are suffering from domestic abuse during the lockdown will still be able to get support from the police ms patel said for the victims of these crimes home is not the safe haven that it should be and that is why i have been working with law enforcement charities schools businesses

total crime had dropped as people follow the advice to stay at home criminals were adapting to exploit the virus the home secretary added fraudsters are exploiting coronavirus as a hook for new acquisitive crimes with losses to victims already exceeding 1.8 million the perpetrators of sickening online child abuse are seeking to exploit the fact that more and more young people and children are at home and online and in the last week the national domestic abuse helpline reported a 120 % increase in the number of calls it received in one 24-hour period chairman of the national police

spread of coronavirus on the day the uk recorded its highest daily rise in covid-19 deaths speaking at the daily government coronavirus briefing there was a note of optimism at the prime minister 's condition who is now reported to be able to take short walks mr hancock said he was very happy to report that boris johnson continues to improve after he was moved out of intensive care on thursday where he was being treated for coronavirus announcing the ppe plan which has three strands one of which is distribution mr hancock said the goal of that everyone working in a critical role must get the personal protective equipment ppe that they need he added there is a huge international demand for ppe and a global squeeze on supply as he said distribution was a key goal of the plan but that it would require a herculean logistical effort we ve brought together the nhs private industry and the army in fact the armed forces to create a giant ppe distribution network on an unprecedented scale he said mr hancock said that since the start of the outbreak there have been more than 742 million pieces of ppe delivered to the frontline there s enough ppe to go around but only if its used in line with our guidance we need everyone to treat ppe like the precious resource that it is that means only using it when there s a clinical need and not using more than is needed he said mr hancock said the third strand of the ppe plan is about the future supply were using up ppe on an unprecedented scale so were constantly buying more from abroad and now making it at home he said he thanked

visiting his elderly parents during the coronavirus lockdown saying he was delivering items including medicines robert jenrick said he respected social distancing when he dropped off medicines and other essentials to his parents who are self isolating at their home while the governments guidelines state you should not visit anyone who lives outside your own home including elderly relatives you are allowed to leave your house to help them for example by dropping shopping or medication at their door on thursday evening the guardian reported that a witness told the paper they saw mr jenrick visiting his parents shropshire house at the weekend which is 40 miles from his own how have people been coping with the coronavirus lockdown later in a tweet mr jenrick said for clarity my parents asked me to deliver some essentials including medicines they are both self isolating due to age and my fathers medical condition and i respected social distancing rules he included a link to the guardian story in his tweet meanwhile the daily mail reported that mr jenrick had travelled from his residence in london to a second home in herefordshire during the lockdown the minister told the paper my house in herefordshire is the place i my wife and my young children consider to be our family home and my family were there before any restrictions on travel were announced i have been working in london on ministerial duties putting in place the system to shield the group most vulnerable to coronavirus and organising the response at a local level once i was able to work from home it was right that i went home to do so and be with my wife and also help care for my three young children he added that he would be staying at the family home until government advice changes or he is needed in westminster mr jenrick who is the minister responsible for local government and mp for newark has spoken at the daily downing street press conferences and is key member of the cabinet on sunday dr catherine calderwood resigned her position as scotlands chief medical officer after she visited her holiday home twice during the coronavirus lockdown raab no lockdown decision until the end of next week on our politics podcast when will lockdown end thursday 's meeting of the emergency cobra committee that takes decisions on how to protect us from the ravages of covid-19 was suppose to be a 15 minute formality to rubber stamp a decision to make no decision at all on when and whether to ease these unprecedented on our freedoms but because the telecoms connections for this video conference call were ropey and the ministers chaired by the first secretary of state dominic raab struggled to be understood the 15 minutes extended to a frustrating 45 minutes even so ministers did decide to mandate the government 's scientists on the so called sage committee to gather the data necessary to inform a political decision on how and when to return our way of life to something that feels a bit more like normal so the plan is that at the end of next week there should be an announcement of the skeleton of an idea of a possible programme that might allow businesses to function a bit more normally and for us to be in the presence of though not close to our nearest and dearest we must keep going no decision on lockdown until the end of next week foreign secretary dominic raab says uk coronavirus death toll rises to 7,978 as dominic raab says it 's too early to lift restrictions that said ministers caution me that the current lockdown will continue for several weeks yet not least because we are some days from seeing the peak usage of intensive care beds by covid-19 sufferers and in the words of the government 's chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance daily deaths from the terrible virus will continue to rise for another 14 days or so after that peak such is the lag between entry to intensive care and either death or recovery for what it 's worth that implies the uk may well be heading for a covid-19 death toll of at least 30,000 people which elevates it well beyond a bad winter flu ministers are aware quite how high the stakes have become and not just because of potential mortality they are shocked that the damage already caused to the economy is considerably worse than they expected it is striking for example that the bank of england warned tonight that economic activity is like to decline much more sharply than it war gamed in recent stress tests many more companies than they expected have more or less shut down and are therefore claiming tens of billions of pounds in subsidies for their employees ' wages via the furlough scheme or grants under the small business support scheme and as the work and pensions secretary therese coffey said last night on my show the number of new claims for universal credit is running at three times the normal rate and the number of new claims in total since the onset of the lockdown has surged by 1.2 m little wonder the bank of england today made available increased direct lending to the government through what is in effect an overdraft called the ways and means facility even if the government can borrow what it needs from investors by selling government bonds or gilts to them the rate at which it is having to subsidise millions of people 's incomes is both fast and unpredictable so the buffer of an overdraft is essential but it is not just the profound shock to the economy and the cost especially to those on lower incomes that is troubling ministers there is growing evidence of significant mental health trauma for those in isolation so work is going on encouraged by the nhs to evaluate whether all those in the most extreme form of the lockdown those who need the most complete shielding because of their frailties could be allowed a bit more social contact this question about whether there are some categories of vulnerable people who could be released from shielding is urgent work in progress i am told there is a final source of deep anxiety to ministers namely that the squeeze on nhs capacity caused by covid-19 is significantly impairing the health service 's ability to help those suffering from other acute and chronic illnesses and conditions in other words lives will be lost that would otherwise be saved all of which makes it incredibly complicated to know how and when to give us back some of our freedoms even without considering that there are not yet adequate therapies for those suffering from the virus or sufficient testing capacity to determine who in the community has or has had the virus or technology to carry out contact tracing of those who 've been in the presence of an infected person so i would be staggered if next week there was a firm timetable to allow life to resume a bit more in the old way at best there may be a nod to when schools will re - open as a possible first stage and whether in general we 'll get a phased and staggered national return to normal life or an adaptive plan that is sensitive to surges of infection in different communities my guess is there will be a nod towards a very gradual return of our freedoms with the emphasis on desperately trying to limit the economic harm but i would n't plan on holding street parties any time soon coronavirus everything you need to know check the number of

pandemic mp for luton north sarah owen addressed the letter to matt hancock and wrote that cancelling the debt would be an important signal to those starting their career that they are valued the letter is signed by 81 mps including diane abbott stella creasy and jess phillips the public will once again clap for carers on thursday night and ms owen argues the government should reflect their gratitude over the last few weeks we have seen the whole country united in our gratitude to those working night and day to keep our nhs going and look after our loved ones at this difficult time the letter states if this coronavirus pandemic has proved anything it is just how much we owe to those in the health service who are there for us when we need them most health education england announced that in response to the crisis 5,553 students from 35 universities had been signed up to a paid placement as of friday the letter continues this will involve rearranging their studies nhs launches mental health hotline for staff members tackling coronavirus queen marks world health day by thanking healthcare workers for selfless commitment this is testament to the hard work and sense of duty that those nhs staff feel states the letter especially during these unprecedented times therefore we are calling on the government to support these new nurses by cancelling the student debt they have incurred throughout their studies the letter states in future it would be a real sign of permanent change from the government if we could see that every nurse left their training and education without any debt but right now student nurses are risking their own health to help care for people during the crisis in really difficult circumstances managing unprecedented demand and often without the correct protective equipment cancelling this debt as a first step for this group of hardworking nurses would be an important signal to those starting their careers during the crisis that they are

published later he believes there 's a long way to go before testing is at the level it needs to be he welcomed testing facilities being opened across the country but said the ideally need to have testing available really within our trusts i do nt think the nhs testing is accessible as it needs to be we ve got a long way to go we need to be able to essentially in my opinion have tests at the point of care in our own trusts so that we can get the answer very very quickly its absolutely vital he told podcast host daniel hewitt despite having several years experience as a doctor he said he 's needing to prepare himself mentally ahead of every shift he said there s no doubt that we are almost going into battle at the moment i think we all have that mindset when we go into work as i drive to a&e i often prepare myself mentally for what were going to experience what were going to see and when you go into those doors you know its going to be a difficult scenario that you re facing there s no hiding from that calling peston the itv news politics podcast listen and subscribe here he said the frequency of trauma in his hospital is affecting the mental health of the staff but said the nhs is very good at supporting each other when we need it he said the trust he works at is looking at how we can have wellness support for staff so how we can actually start supporting staff on the front line who may be are struggling it is difficult for any member of staff to experience the number of patients that were seeing that are really unwell regardless sometimes whether they die or not its still upsetting he added he acknowledged the risk all staff take each day going to work and said the need for personal protective equipment ppe absolutely vital there are risks i have colleagues who ve been unwell and off work i ve heard of the passing of doctors nurses and midwives around the uk its awful to hear but we all know there is that risk he said any cases where people are running

forgive myself it would never cross my mind but you want to do your part you 're a doctor you 're a nurse you went into this profession because you want to help he also thanked the public for staying

leader keir starmer has said coronavirus testing should have been carried out much quicker as he called on the government to publish its strategy on easing the current lockdown the newly elected leader told itv 's peston that under him the labour party would support the government where it was right to do so but also have the courage to challenge them where they were getting wrong in response to itv news political editor robert peston 's questions about whether the government had been too slow to roll out covid-19 tests mr starmer said we should have ramped up testing much much more quickly who is in sir keir starmers shadow cabinet i think there are things to learn from germany as a result of that and we do need to ask probing questions of the government about that but he said now was not the time for quipping from the labour benches about what should have been done at the moment what we want to do is to make sure we actually get that testing he said the government has so far not released any details on how and when the coronavirus restrictions will be lifted fearing people would not follow the strict social distancing rules currently in place sir keir said it was important for the government to set out what the strategy was because as i see it a vaccine is obviously the long term solution but it looks like that wo n't be ready for 12 to 18 months and therefore all the focus is on testing he said sir keir continued the one test that tells you whether you 've got it is i hope going to be available in much greater numbers that 's what the government have committed to but he said the problem with the test that shows whether you have the virus or not was only a way of controlling things and not a way out sir keir refused to rule out forming a national government with the government to see the country through the coronavirus crisis he said he had been fully briefed on the coronavirus situation since his election within an hour of being elected i had a conversation with the prime minister about the arrangements that we would put in place i asked for confidential briefings on a privy council basis from the experts on a one on one basis and for access to ministers on the same basis the prime minister agreed to that i told him that the labour party under my leadership would be constructive and pull together in the national interest and that meant having the courage to support the government where it was right to do so but also having the courage to challenge them where they were getting wrong or they were going too slowly sir keir denied purging the corbynistas from his shadow cabinet saying the new team comes from all bits of the party it 's a very diverse team with representatives from across the united kingdom it 's a very exciting talented team going forward and i can tell you robert that the feeling of the labour party coming together has been palpable over the last few days there 's a real energy and spirit of hope in what we

prime minister boris johnson who is in intensive care being treated for covid-19 he said the pm is receiving excellent care in hospital and is sitting up in bed and engaging positively with the clinical team the prime minister is not only my colleague and my boss but also my friend and my thoughts are with him and his family he added the pm continues to receive standard oxygen treatment and is breathing without any other assistance his spokesperson said it was revealed thursday afternoon that some 7,097 have sadly died in hospital after contracting coronavirus as of april 7 at 5 pm the department of health said as of 9 am on wednesday 232,708 people have been tested for covid-19 of which 60,733 tested positive bernie sanders has ended his us presidential campaign after disappointing primary results the vermont senators announcement to step aside makes joe biden the presumptive democratic nominee to challenge president donald trump in november mr sanders initially exceeded sky high expectations about his ability to recreate the magic of his 2016 presidential bid and even overcame a heart attack last october on the campaign trail but he found himself unable to convert unwavering support from progressives into a viable path to the nomination amid electability fears fueled by questions about whether his democratic socialist ideology would be palatable to general election voters mr sanders plans to talk to his supporters later on wednesday joe biden forced to wait in race for nomination joe biden sweeps primaries to take stranglehold on democratic nomination it 's trump vs biden as democrats effectively make their choice the 78-year old senator began his latest white house bid facing questions about whether he could win back the supporters who chose him four years ago as an insurgent alternative to the party establishments choice hillary clinton despite winning 22 states in 2016 there were no guarantees he d be a major presidential contender this cycle especially as the races oldest candidate however he used strong polling and solid fundraising collected almost entirely from small donations made online to more than quiet early doubters mr sanders amassed the most votes in iowa and new hampshire which opened primary voting and cruised to an easy victory in nevada seemingly leaving him well positioned to sprint to the democratic nomination but a crucial endorsement of mr biden by influential south carolina representative jim clyburn and a subsequent larger than expected victory in south carolina propelled the former vice president into super tuesday when he won 10 of 14 states the great recovery joe biden is americas 77-year old comeback kid in a matter of days his top former democratic rivals lined up and announced their endorsement of mr biden the former vice president 's campaign had appeared on the brink of collapse after new hampshire but found new life as the rest of the party 's more moderate establishment coalesced around him as an alternative to mr sanders things only got worse the following week when mr sanders lost michigan where he had campaigned hard and upset mrs clinton in 2016 he was also beaten in missouri mississippi and idaho the same night and the results were so decisive that mr sanders headed to vermont without speaking to the media mr sanders had scheduled a rally in ohio but cancelled it amid fears about the spread of coronavirus and the outbreak kept him home as his campaign appeared unsure of its next move the senator addressed reporters the following day but also sounded like a candidate who already knew he had been beaten while our campaign has won the ideological debate we are losing the debate over electability mr sanders said then video report by itv news

symptoms of coronavirus the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster part of the government 's lead team giving advice on covid-19 remains well but must stay in isolation as per public health instruction with prime minister boris johnson in intensive care after his coronavirus symptoms worsened it had been expected mr gove would continue to play a leading role in the government 's response to the outbreak he will continue to work from quarantine and in morning interviews before his isolation was revealed he said the work of government goes on mr gove said mr johnson is receiving the very very best care and insisted that the government machine is continuing to function boris johnson given oxygen support in intensive care politicians from all sides offer support to boris johnson as he 's moved to intensive care prime minister ' very likely to need ventilator professor says we 're all working together to implement the plan the prime minister set out in order to try to ensure that we can marshal all the resources of government indeed all the resources of our country in the fight against this invisible enemy he told bbc breakfast the work of government goes on we have a superb civil service and they have ensured that the machinery is there for decisions to be made by ministers by medical and scientific experts and for those decisions to be followed through in a way which enables us to help those at the front line with mr johnson in intensive care foreign secretary dominic raab who is deputising is leading the government 's daily coronavirus war cabinet meetings mr gove who has known mr johnson since they met as students said the prime minister being in intensive care is terrible he told good morning britain we are just hoping and praying that he pulls through it was a shock yesterday to hear the news about his going into intensive care he added we 're desperately hoping that boris can make the speediest possible recovery i had been puzzling about why for most of the past 12 days until last night the pm and his advisers had been insisting in tweets short videos and statements that he was still running the show in spite of the evidence that he was seriously and worryingly under the weather the answer which is conspicuous this morning is that although dominic raab has been asked by the pm to deputise for him when chairing important committees including cabinet he is not in charge in the way that a pm appointed by hm the queen and a tory leader elected by tory mps and party members would always be it is not his fault but he has no proper mandate this absence of a conventional leader of the nation is complicated and concerning for two reasons first and to state the spectacularly obvious we face the greatest peacetime crisis of our age momentous life and death decisions need to be taken for how lives are saved for how our prosperity is protected and that 's proportionately harder in the absence of someone unambiguously in charge which johnson was and raab can never be for structural constitutional reasons it 's all very well for ministers to say they are being led by the science and the scientists but science and scientists simply provide the information on which choices have to be made the buck stops with the pm and his cabinet second and this also should not be ignored the absence of a prime minister even for a short while is especially troubling when parliament is not sitting to have a prime minister uniquely incapacitated but the government not able to be held to account by a parliament where true sovereignty resides under the british system will be troubling for many all of which carries a series of important consequences one as a senior member of the government told me is that ministers will have to break the habits of a lifetime and put aside their vanity and personal rivalries they need to show a spirit of collective endeavour but with the best will in the world even if the michael gove is proved right in saying on the today programme that decisions will be taken collectively and following appropriate advice they ca n't for a while at least be taken expeditiously given that the downing street and cabinet office machines that serve the prime minister have very little working relationship with raab and are anyway seriously depleted by illness all of which is to say that running the country is going to be nerve wrackingly difficult for boris johnson 's government in his absence and apart from gove 's collective cabinet endeavour the government will also have to demonstrate unprecedented levels of openness and transparency about how and why decisions are being made both with the opposition parties and with all of us to get through this the whole country has to pull together especially at a time when our precious freedoms are so constrained and in the absence of a prime minister we 'll only maintain that united front if our understanding of what the government is doing and why is considerably deeper and richer than normal coronavirus everything you need to know check the number of cases in your area with our interactive map listen and subscribe to our podcast all the coronavirus information you need in one place from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus video report by itv news health correspondent emily morgan an expert has warned the prime minister is extremely sick and could require invasive ventilation a common treatment for coronavirus patients who need intensive care boris johnson was moved to the critical unit at st thomas ' hospital on monday evening as part of his ongoing treatment for covid-19 mr johnson was understood to be conscious when he was moved to intensive care at about 7 pm as a precaution should he require ventilation to aid his recovery speaking on tuesday morning cabinet minister michael gove said the prime minister has been given oxygen support in intensive care but has not been on a ventilator icu dr alison pittard outlines the kind of treatment boris johnson can expect in hospital prime minister boris johnson spends night in intensive care after being admitted to hospital with coronavirus intensive care expert explains how ventilators work why they 're crucial and whether the nhs has enough of them however if the pm 's conditions worsen derek hill professor of medical imaging at university college london ucl said the prime minister could be given a breathing aid known as continuous positive airway pressure cpap the device bridges the gap between an oxygen mask and full ventilation and uses pressure to send a blend of air and oxygen into the mouth at a steady rate so boosting the amount of oxygen that enters the lungs but prof hill warned many covid-19 patients eventually progress to invasive ventilation being put on a ventilator this is for people whose illness is so severe they are struggling or unable to breathe for themselves ventilators are being made and brought in for the nhs michael gove says a mechanical ventilator either does all the breathing for the patient or assists the patient 's own breathing the patient is heavily sedated while a device called an endotracheal tube et is guided through the mouth into the windpipe heavy sedation is then continued because having a tube in the throat can be very uncomfortable patients can be fed at the same time through a tube going into their stomach via their nose prof hill said it was unclear whether mr johnson was breathing on his own or with the help of some form of ventilator the professor added one of the features of covid-19 in all countries seems to be that many more men become seriously ill than women especially in the over 40 age group also we know that people under about 60 seem to have a higher chance of making a recovery from critical illness with covid-19 than older people but there is no doubt this turn of events means boris johnson is extremely sick it illustrates three of the important healthcare needs of covid-19 what are the symptoms to look out for how shielding protects those most at risk of coronavirus firstly many patients need help breathing and there is a shortage of the mechanical ventilators that can do this and in particular a shortage of the high quality intensive care ventilators most suitable for covid-19 patients who might need help breathing for over a week secondly covid-19 patients need a huge amount of oxygen to help them breathe which is potentially going to be in short supply thirdly looking after people in intensive care requires skilled staff and the experience of new york has been that finding enough skilled staff has been the greatest challenge the prime minister who celebrated his 55th birthday last june could also have blood and samples from his throat collected according to guidance issued to doctors by the the world health organization who last month the health body says around 14 % of covid-19 patients will develop symptoms severe enough to need oxygen therapy and 5 % will need intensive care treatment the prime minister is likely to have already undergone several tests to check his oxygen levels white blood cell count and liver and kidney function before he is released from hospital following his admission over covid-19 according to doctors an intensive care consultant explains what icu is and how patients are treated in critical care he is also likely to undergo an electrocardiogram to check his heart government will carry on while prime minister boris johnson is treated in hospital writes robert peston politicians from all sides offer support to boris johnson as he 's moved to intensive care gp dr sarah jarvis told the bbc shortly after mr johnson was admitted on sunday that the pm

downing street confirming that prime minister boris johnson has been transferred to intensive care after his coronavirus symptoms worsened on monday afternoon boris johnson has said dominic raab would deputise where necessary in his absence the foreign secretary has spent much of the last month trying to get britons repatriated from various far flung corners of the globe amid the coronavirus outbreak the intricacies of negotiating border closures grounded planes and stubborn international authorities has seen the foreign office come under increasing pressure to get its stranded citizens home dominic raab on brexit boris johnson feminism and changing gender dominic raab on why he is not a feminist and how he was undermined as brexit secretary upon being appointed foreign secretary last summer mr raab was soon thrust into handling the transatlantic fall out over the death of british teenager harry dunn who was killed when his motorbike crashed into a car outside raf croughton in northamptonshire on august 27 last year the fact mr dunns parents tried to heckle mr raab at a constituency hustings event was indicative of how well the family felt he dealt with obtaining justice for their son mr raab also had to manage the thorny issue of repatriating children of british jihadis by then he had already established himself as an uncompromising figure in politics following his election to the seat of esher and walton in david camerons sweeping conservative victory of 2010 he rarely strayed from his dedication to leaving the european union an enviable characteristic for a conservative government elected four months ago on a mandate to get brexit done speaking to itv news political correspondent paul brand on the acting prime minister podcast he said he would probably not describe himself as a feminist mr raab also revealed a more personal side during the chat dominic raab on brexit boris johnson and changing gender in fact when asked about the last time he cried the mp began his answer with oh god after some pondering he said i 'm not someone that bursts into tears but i can tell you we wept when my father died my mum 's been through cancer twice i think those were moments when of course i was very choked up but we 've also got the stubborn optimism to pull through the former brexit secretarys relentless commitment to the cause even led to him saying he would keep open the option of suspending parliament in order to prevent mps blocking it in fact mr raab memorably quit his cabinet role in protest against theresa mays doomed plan to leave the bloc in november 2018 the former foreign office lawyer who studied law at oxford and for a masters at cambridge is the son of a czech born jewish refugee who fled the nazis in 1938 he was brought up in

all the coronavirus information you need in one place from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus video report by itv news political correspondent paul brand foreign secretary dominic raab has said boris johnson still remains in charge of the country as prime minister despite being admitted to hospital as his coronavirus symptoms persist when asked about mr johnson 's health mr raab said i can tell you the pm had a comfortable night in hospital and is in good spirits he added he is still in hospital under observation he is being given regular updates on developments and he continues to lead the government who will run the country if prime minister boris johnson ca n't when asked about whether the lockdown restrictions would be extended professor dame angela mclean deputy chief scientific adviser said its too early to tell yet we need people to carry on following those instructions so that we can work out three weeks later what actually happens in hospitals mr raab added we 're getting on making sure we can defeat the virus home and abroad itv news political editor robert peston explains why people are critical of boris johnson 's decision to work despite showing symptoms professor chris whitty in his first public appearance since recovering from coronavirus symptoms also said it would be a mistake to discuss the next phase of managing the pandemic until there is confidence that the peak has been reached he said the key thing is to get to the point where we are confident we have reached the peak and this is now beyond the peak and at that point i think it is possible to have a serious discussion about all the things we need to do step by step to move to the next phase of managing this but i think to start having that discussion until were confident that that s where we ve got to would i think be a mistake his comments come as the number of coronavirus related deaths in the uk has risen by 439 bringing the total to 5,373 mr raab gave an update on the number of people the foreign office has helped to return to britain he told a press briefing that his department had helped 200,000 return on commercial flights from spain alone since the crisis began 13,000 from egypt and 8,000 from indonesia chartered flights by the uk government from seven countries had helped more than 2,000 british nationals return home while another 1,500 had been repatriated from cruise ships and the cabinet minister promised all was being done to return those still stuck abroad with more flights from india south africa nepal and the philippines flying in later this week at the daily press briefings of senior ministers the medical and the scientific advisers there is a reluctance to talk about a timescale for an exit strategy from these unprecedentedly severe restrictions on our freedom to move around and see people and even to discuss what that strategy might look like the understandable priority is to get us to commit wholeheartedly to the surrender of these basic rights so that the incidence of the virus can be slashed and many lives can be saved among the senior medical and scientific advisers who seem to be steering pretty much everything right now any initiatives that are n't about immediate virus suppression are deemed a potentially harmful luxury so if there is one benefit to the boffins of the pm going to hospital it is presumably that this is the most powerful symbol that avoiding all unnecessary contact with other people is not a game but the potential difference between life and death johnson ' remains in charge but virus symptoms ' persistent all that said if we do n't start planning now urgently to create conditions in which it is safe to leave our homes the cure for the epidemic may turn out almost as disastrous as the epidemic itself because if the economy and society remain in the deep freeze for too long disproportionately more jobs would be permanently lost government debt would rise perhaps to levels that are costly to bear revenues to fund public services would fall well beyond what 's tolerable and there 'd be a whole variety of social economic and psychological harm for many people the choice facing boris johnson in his bed at st thomas ' hospital is one devised by the devil lift the restrictions too quickly and appalling numbers will become infected and die as the nhs collapses under the weight of those needing succour lift the restrictions too late and swathes of the uk 's jobs and tax revenues would be lost forever with disproportionate damage for those who are poorest and frailest what tests will the prime minister have in hospital all the coronavirus information you need in one place for what its worth business leaders tell me they are already planning for wholesale redundancies in the early autumn when the government 's job support scheme is scheduled to have finished because they expect the demand for their services and products to have been permanently reduced scaremongering possibly safe to ignore definitely not the key to ending this lockdown is almost certainly not a population wide vaccination programme since none of the leading scientists expect that to be available until well into next year if ever waiting for a cure may be waiting for godot the optimal practical route out may therefore be a policy of testing everyone coupled with technology that allows easy contact tracing of anyone who has met an infected person in the previous few days it would be a combination of smartphone apps like the singapore one that monitors and records everyone we come within a few metres of drive through pcr covid-19 antigen tests on an industrial scale and home testing antibody tests the pinprick equivalent of a home pregnancy test who will run the country if the prime minister ca n't in other words lifting the lockdown probably requires accurate surveillance over months and even possibly years of those who have and have had the virus and enforceable rules for strict quarantining those who are unlucky enough to catch it in that future now for the avoidance of doubt the government is working on all these strands of prophylactic policy the question is whether it is doing so with sufficient urgency the point is that even if the government hits its target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of april and that is looking a stretch at that rate it would take the best part of two years to test us all and to be clear these would be largely the wrong kind of tests for returning life to normal because according to john newton who has been put in charge of expanding testing capacity these would all be antigen tests that show whether we are carrying the live virus not the antibody test for whether we have had it and may be immune as he told me the government has not yet identified an antibody test that works though he is confident his scientists can work with the manufacturers to find a breakthrough he just ca n't say when that eureka will happen government will carry on while pm is treated in hospital the analogy with war especially the second world war is overdone but if this were a war a huge part of public and private sectors would be mobilised to do almost nothing but concentrate on creating the medical tests and information technology to enforce mass community screening the problem as far as i can see is a lack of the ruthless centralisation by government of managing commissioning procuring and authorising that would be necessary and expected in this time of such acute crisis i am aware of numerous largely philanthropic private sector initiatives to provide tests and technology one is project little boat led by the businessman nick markham it is trying to set up drive by antigen testing here based on the korean model and is waiting for government approval for and purchase of the testing kits it says it has secured from korea another initiative is an order brokered by an entrepreneur for 1 m antibody rapid lateral flow test strip kits that i 've referred to in an earlier note from wondfo of china neither of these kits have been approved for use by the relevant british scientists and regulators and nor have any other of the innovative approaches to testing that have been imported i do n't remotely doubt the good faith of ministers in resisting the temptation to be rushed into authorising tests like these for use as the health secretary matt hancock does n't tire of saying a bad test may well be worse than no test at all but the business people who are involved in trying to develop mass community testing fear that the british civil service and the medical establishment are too wedded to the traditional approval processes and that they are being too conservative and cautious i would not presume to have the medical knowledge to adjudicate but i do recall a phrase that michael gove employed for a different and lesser crisis the brexit one which was not to let the best be the enemy of the good at this historic juncture where so much is at stake we must hope and even perhaps pray that the government and its advisers are not sacrificing a workable solution in the pursuit of a perfect one ed miliband will return to the labour frontbench under sir keir starmer as the new leader revealed an overhauled shadow cabinet that includes his

the bbc in the weeks to come although an exit strategy would require much more testing he said an exit strategy that 's sustainable will also have to be accompanied by much greater testing and tracing than we are able to do today the minister also gave details of the number of ventilators currently available to the nhs uk queues up for lifesaving ventilators from china coronavirus patients could have treatment withdrawn to save others if hospitals become overwhelmed mr jenrick said 9,000 machines are available out of a target of 18,000 adding that the nhs has sufficient capacity despite a rise in demand as a result of the outbreak he added we 're obviously trying to increase the number of ventilators as quickly as we can importing some from overseas and then working with british manufacturers to manufacture more elsewhere the former head of the civil service lord kerslake has said it may be sensible for boris johnson to step back if he is not well enough to carry out his role

the virus boris johnson is likely to undergo tests to check his oxygen levels white blood cell count and liver and kidney function before he is released from hospital following his admission over coronavirus according to doctors the prime minister is also likely to undergo an electrocardiogram to check his heart mr johnson tested positive for the virus 10 days ago but spent sunday night in hospital as his symptoms continue to persist boris johnson spends night in hospital as he battles coronavirus government will carry on while prime minister boris johnson is treated in hospital writes robert peston gp dr sarah jarvis told the bbc mr johnson would also have his chest x - rayed and lungs scanned particularly if he was found to be struggling for breath dr jarvis said around 80 % of people who contract the virus only suffer from mild symptoms while the remaining 20 % could suffer moderate to severe illness dr jarvis said the prime minister continues to lead government so probably has moderate disease she added the main focus though is going to be on his lungs dr jarvis continued the majority of people with moderate or severe symptoms are going to progress to have inflammation of the lungs and that inflammation can result in damage to lung tissue but also importantly can prevent oxygen being transferred into the bloodstream she said it would probably take a few hours for the tests to be conducted and the scans analysed by a consultant dr bharat pankhania senior clinical lecturer university of exeter medical school said the pm 's doctors would be be playing it safe because pneumonia can take hold very quickly dr pankhania said if a patient is developing pneumonia it can get progressively worse very quickly and hence early admission upon the first signs of difficulty with breathing are very important those with moderate or severe symptoms tend to become breathless very quickly and suffer from exhaustion dr jarvis warned and said it would be difficult for the prime minister to carry on working as a result what does boris johnson 's hospital admission mean what are the coronavirus symptoms to look out for at the severe stage they may become more breathless even at rest and find it difficult to speak more than a couple of sentences those are the levels at which you should be calling for emergency help she said given that we have been told that at this stage this is routine his brain certainly sounds like it is getting enough oxygen but it is clearly exhausting she said it was possible mr johnson had received a larger dose of the virus than health secretary matt hancock mr hancock was diagnosed at the same time and has since recovered returning to host the government 's daily update on the outbreak dr jarvis said that may be why someone who lives in a house with someone who has been affected and is constantly exposed to the virus is more likely to get severe illness likewise there is something called anti - body dependent enhancement where your immune system may go into overdrive and that may account for some people getting very severe inflammation coronavirus everything you need to know check the number of cases in your area with

being examined after submitting spending reports which were missing information that would give voters a complete picture of their campaign spending it added that parties are required by law to provide complete lists of all campaign payments and supporting invoices or receipts for payments of more than 200 it confirmed two investigations have been opened naming the tories and the greens and said further may arise ex - head of electoral commission resigns from firm linked to controversial ads how big and imaginative will the chancellor 's economic rescue package be but the commission would not expand further on the other parties being looked at explaining it only names those under investigation in line with its enforcement policy fines ranging from 200 to a maximum of 20,000 per offence are among the options available to the commission if it deems enforcement action to be appropriate figures released by the commission also showed the brexit party spent the most money on

be held but extensions to the brexit process meant it went ahead the uks departure from the eu on january 31 meant the country no longer had any of its 73 meps elected in 2019 health secretary matt hancock said coronavirus had left him feeling as if he had swallowed razors as his body fought against the virus mr hancock said he was unable to eat drink or sleep properly for two days or so owing to the impact covid-19 had on him describing his own experience as pretty nasty he told good morning britain i had two days or so when it was like just razors in your throat a very very sore throat i could n't eat and i could n't drink global coronavirus cases pass one million the worst bit was on the way down worrying how bad it would get because we 've all seen how bad it can get and it seems to be indiscriminate he said he had also suffered a bit of a cough and lost half a stone in weight the health secretary tested positive for covid-19 last week just hours after boris johnson announced he too had contracted the virus mr hancock came out of self isolation yesterday but the prime minister is thought to still be self isolating as he is still suffering from mild symptoms itv news science editor tom clarke reports on covid-19 testing in the uk the government has been criticised for not carrying out enough coronavirus testing but mr hancock said he was committed to increasing testing capacity to 250,000 a day currently the number of tests being carried out each day in the uk is around 10,000 matt hancock told itv news science editor tom clarke it was unfair to say there had been a shift in opinion as to whether testing was critical to the uk 's response to the coronavirus i think that 's a bit unfair on the team who have been ramping up to 10,000 tests a day i set them that goal and they met it to get to 10,000 by the end of march after all just a month ago we had just under 2,000 tests a day and we were one of the first countries in the world to develop a test at all and now we have the new goal both for my team and the whole life sciences sector to get to 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month it comes as the john hopkins university in the us which is tracking the global picture said covid-19 cases have now passed one million across the world elsewhere the nhs nightingale hospital at the excel centre in east london has been officially opened while two other temporary hospitals have also been announced for bristol and harrogate speaking on bbc radio 4 's today programme mr hancock said it is unclear whether he is now immune to covid-19 i took advice on that and the advice is it 's highly likely that i am now immune or have a very high level of immunity he said but it 's not certain coronavirus everything you need to know check the number of cases in your area with our interactive map listen and subscribe to our podcast all the coronavirus information you need in one place from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus some 100,000 people in the uk will be tested for coronavirus each day by the end of the month the health secretary has said as he outlined the government 's five point plan to reach this target matt hancock said the five pillars of the plan would see a ramping up of testing capabilities across the uk in recent days the government has been criticised for being able to carry out just 10,000 covid-19 tests per day mr hancock who was taking the daily coronavirus press conference after returning from self isolation said significant progress had already been made he continued that the government had enlisted the help of companies such as amazon and boots as well as universities and research labs to help them hit their target of 100,000 tests per day he said once an antibody test was approved which would confirm whether someone has had the virus immunity certificates could be issued we are looking at an immunity certificate how people who have had the disease have got the antibodies and therefore have the immunity can show that and so get back as much as possible to normal life he said stay at home or others will die graphic lockdown warning what you can and ca n't do during the uk lockdown intensive care expert on why ventilators are crucial watch itv news political correspondent paul brand 's video report above mr hancock who last friday revealed he had caught coronavirus explained why the uk was so far behind other countries in terms of testing capacity he said the uk lacked a large diagnostics industry so was having to build from a lower base than the likes of germany which has been able to carry out around 50,000 coronavirus tests a day he said a country wide shortage of swabs had been resolved but that there remained a global challenge around sourcing the reagent chemicals needed for the tests itv news science editor tom clarke reports on the testing of nhs staff for covid-19 mr hancock outlined the order of testing prioritisation as being patients then critical care staff then nhs and social care staff more generally then other key workers and finally the general population part of the plan to increase testing involves using commercial partners including universities and private businesses to establish more swab testing he said companies like amazon and boots were helping to build from scratch a network of new labs and testing sites across the country this brand new service has just launched and is ramping up rapidly he said the new five pillar plan outlines the ambitions to scale up swab testing in phe labs and nhs hospitals for those with a medical need and the most critical workers to 25,000 a day by mid to late april deliver increased commercial swab testing for critical key workers in the nhs before then expanding to key workers in other sectors develop blood testing to help know if people have the right antibodies and so have high levels of immunity to coronavirus conduct surveillance testing to learn more about the spread of the disease and help develop new tests and treatments and create a new national effort for testing to build a mass testing capacity at a completely new scale his comments follow a video posted by prime minister boris johnson on wednesday evening in which he committed to massively ramp up testing as it would allow britain to unlock the coronavirus puzzle and defeat it in the end public health england 's medical director paul cosford insisted to itv news science editor tom clarke that capabilities are ramping up as we speak he pointed to five drive through testing facilities

coronavirus lockdown mr hancock said nhs staff will be able to get tested for covid-19 absolutely before the end of the month he added with 5,000 tested since staff testing started at the weekend we ve clearly made significant progress mr hancock said the figure of 100,000 tests by the end of april will cover all five of his testing pillars he added that large scale antibody testing to see if someone has been infected with the virus and recovered will only be rolled out when clinicians are confident it is a valid test mr hancock said there was a challenge in ensuring the public could have confidence in the tests being used on nhs staff itv news political editor robert peston on 100,000 a day test ambition he added that a number of testing methods being analysed had failed to positively diagnose a coronavirus patient he said no test is better than a bad test mr hancock also announced more than 13 billion of historic nhs debt will be written off to place trusts in a stronger position to respond to the coronavirus crisis he said he had made 300 million available for community pharmacies and that he wanted to make sure every part of the health and care system is supported he added today to help nhs trusts to deliver what s needed without worrying about past finances i can announce that i m writing off 13.4 billion of historic nhs debt this landmark step will not only put the nhs in a stronger position to be able to respond to this global coronavirus pandemic but it will ensure that our nhs has stronger foundations for the future too mr hancock paid an emotional tribute to nhs staff who have lost their lives and expressed his deepest condolences to the friends and families of all coronavirus victims doctors nurses mental health professionals they have paid the ultimate price for their service working to care for others he said i just want to say this on behalf of all my colleagues in health and social care i am awed by the dedication of colleagues on the frontline every single person who contributes to the running of this diverse and caring institution that our nation holds so dear many of those who have died who are from the nhs were people who came to this country to make a difference and they did and they ve given their lives in sacrifice and we salute them on daily testing levels mr hancock said yes we do hope to get to 250,000 the commitment that i m making today is that our goal is 100,000 by the end of the month i want to bring this whole national effort to bear on that and then we will keep going once we have reached that 100,000 and so absolutely i stand by the commitment that the prime minister made of 250,000 the government has scaled up its public health messaging with a series of striking adverts warning the public people will die if stay at home measures are ignored during the coronavirus lockdown full page adverts featuring the new messages have been placed in most national newspapers while social media users have also been targeted the new campaign takes a far stronger tone than any produced by the government before with red and yellow colouring and dramatic images of nhs staff in face masks and other protective

expert and managing director of the source pr said the government was learning from their mistakes in terms of its communications strategy coronavirus patients could have treatment withdrawn to save others if hospitals become overwhelmed mr hill said i believe that the government has noted that their earlier tactics were not successful and has now moved to more open transparent and if you like firmer comms the announcement of a lockdown was unlike anything our generation has ever seen the messaging from the government was clear and concise you must not leave your home before this using words such as we advise and we suggest meant that many did not feel inclined to follow the rules he added downing street and prime minister boris johnson in particular had previously faced criticism for communications from ministers and official government channels in the early stages of the outbreak in full johnsons coronavirus letter to 30 million uk households warning things will get worse before they get better since testing positive for covid-19 mr johnson has been posting self taped videos on social media updating the public on the government 's actions during the outbreak ministers had been accused of failing to act quickly enough to prevent the spread of the virus initially saying it was not necessary to cancel mass gatherings including football matches and concerts mr johnson attracted criticism after stating at the beginning of march that he would continue shaking people 's hands despite medical guidance not to do so coronavirus survivor 25 says illness was the most horrendous experience of his life the new advertising push comes after number 10 confirmed the appointment of the conservatives ' party campaign chief isaac levido to aid its communications around the

been viewed as mr corbyn 's continuity candidate and ms nandy the outsider in the deputy leadership contest shadow education secretary ms rayner is the favourite to win earlier this week ms long bailey told of the bizarre prospect that she 'll have to pre - record a victory speech she revealed it was a logistical move that each candidate had been asked to record something as a way to deal with these strange times brought about by the coronavirus after the polls closed in the election sir keir tweeted thanks to all his supporters he added i honestly believe that we have come out of the other end of this contest as a better party more united and ready to build another future ms nandy did the same writing thanks to everyone who s voted in the contest so far very proud to have your support among those eligible to vote in the contest were 114,000 new members who joined since the election plus almost 15,000 registered supporters who paid 25 for the ability to vote on top of that labour had 485,000 members as of july 2019 who would have been able to vote if they remained in the party when voting began on february 23 the winner is selected using a preferential voting system that means voters pick their favourite then their second and third preferences if there is no overall winner the candidate who came last is removed and the second preference of people who voted for

health england 's medical director has said but he insisted capabilities are ramping up as we speak speaking to itv news paul cosford acknowledged the poor testing ratio with just 2,000 nhs staff members being tested as of yesterday compared to the 1.2 million people working for the health service he said the difficulty in ramping up capabilities had been caused by a range of issues such as accuracy of tests and the need for building a whole new and very large capacity very quickly you ll have heard the number 2,000 from yesterday that s nowhere near enough he said the importance of testing is to get it right and of course this was a test that did nt exist at the beginning of the year because we did nt know about the coronavirus he added we ve had to design that test to build that test to make sure that we know how to do it accurately otherwise the test is of no use at all the prime ministers spokesman said that in all 10,412 coronavirus tests were carried out across the uk in nhs and public health england laboratories on tuesday itv news political correspondent paul brand explains issues around testing we acknowledge that more needs to be done in relation to testing we need to be testing more people and we need to be making progress very quickly he said the spokesman said that work was ongoing with nine potential suppliers on developing an antibody test which would show whether people have had the virus but he said it was essential they were accurate we are working as quickly as we can on that and as soon as a test is approved then we will announce it publicly he said he said the government had previously been offered tests which had not met the required levels of accuracy and therefore would not have been safe to use mr cosford claimed scaling up capacity was already going on with five drive through testing facilities already available for nhs staff and another four to come on stream this week coronavirus patients could have treatment withdrawn to save others all the coronavirus information you need in one place another issue in scaling up was caused by the health service needing to use large numbers of laboratories that are not normally part of the core nhs system it just takes time to get that right and unfortunately that s taking more time than we had either hoped or intended he added while he admitted we ve got to get testing right he said we ve also got to absolutely carry on with social distancing if we get social distancing right then hopefully we will see a plateau in the number of cases in a small number of weeks and then the numbers will start to come down and then well be able to lift some of the measures in due course in a video message on wednesday evening the prime minister said he was committed to massively ramp up testing as it would allow britain to unlock the coronavirus puzzle and defeat it in the end mr johnson was already facing criticism for the uk 's initial relaxed attitude to testing after it was said tests would only be carried out on those with symptoms but with his latest comments he 's heaped up expectation to improve britain 's capabilities labour says the uk is not testing enough people compared with other countries shadow attorney general shami chakrabarti said in particular compared with the countries that are doing best at minimising fatalities officials are working hard to address the issue of a lack of tests and to resolve a shortage of testing materials for coronavirus the chief executive of the health service executive said paul reid appealed to the public to bear with us as the hse tries to address the worldwide issue mr reid claimed the issue around testing was a worldwide shortage of reagents which are used in the testing process in a tweet he wrote in a short time we have scaled up on testing centres testing kits contact tracers nbr of labs hospital beds icu ventilators ppe staff coronavirus 2,000 frontline nhs england staff tested out of 1.2 m workers number 10 confirms our current major issue is reagents for labs a worldwide shortage we are working hard to fix this bear with us meanwhile new testing devices that can diagnose covid-19 in less than 90 minutes are being deployed at a hospital in cambridge the portable machines called samba ii have been developed by a university of cambridge spin off company called diagnostics for the real world and 10 are being used at addenbrookes hospital this week the researchers said their tests have been validated by public health england and the devices are expected to be launched in hospitals across the country but many have questioned how with the reagents problem being global countries such as germany have been able to test so many more people than the uk figures released yesterday showed germany had carried out 918,460 coronavirus tests in total on wednesday evening 's daily coronavirus press conference business secretary alok sharma just 152,979 people in the uk have now been tested while germany is carrying out around 50,000 a day mr sharma said the uk 's capacity was at 10,000 tests a day he said it was the government 's priority to boost that figure and professor yvonne doyle who was alongside him said the aim was 25,000 a day she said in terms of mass testing the testing strategy is to increase the amount of testing done not just in healthcare workers but in the population the rate limiting step there is not us it is really whether the tests are valid and then to get that out and about and aided by technology until now the focus has been on testing patients in hospital to see if they have coronavirus with nhs trusts told earlier in the week they should use up to 15 % of any spare testing capacity for nhs staff coronavirus testing is side issue says deputy chief medical officer one million covid-19 test kits are arriving but will they be sent to hospitals uk coronavirus death toll rises by 563 in biggest day on day increase that cap has now been scrapped and the priority is to test frontline staff so anyone self isolating can get back to work if possible prime minister johnson said what we need to do is massively ramp up not just tests so you can know whether you ve had the disease in the past the so called antibody test because that will enable you to go to work in the confidence you can not be infected or infectious second people need to know they have nt got it rather than isolating themselves at home for no reason that s very very important above all for our nhs staff its crucial people who do have the disease are able to be tested positive and to take the necessary steps to isolate at home in the way that i am doing and many many others are doing high streets will today begin receiving the first part of the government 's 22 billion coronavirus benefit package as it aims to keep businesses afloat past the crisis thousands of small businesses in the uk have already received 25,000 cash grants from local authorities the government says and will be exempt from business rates from today for 12 months wednesday it is part of chancellor rishi sunak 's unprecedented finance package designed to ensure businesses in the retail hospitality and leisure sectors are able to reopen when lockdown measures are relaxed mr sunak said the package was announced to give high streets businesses the vital cash they need to ensure their survival during this difficult time he added how high street businesses at the core of what keeps our economy thriving mr sunak said 300 businesses have already received money in their accounts after an early payment of 3.4 billion was made to local authorities last week government to introduce flexible insolvency rules to help businesses self employed to have 80 % of average earnings paid for by the government chancellor compensates workers and becomes the insurer of last resort but several larger high street firms have already collapsed with chiquito brighthouse carluccios and laura ashley all falling into administration the government announced several measures intended to save bigger firms such as the coronavirus job retention scheme which involved the government paying 80 % of furloughed staff members ' wages however for businesses which were already struggling before the lockdown it seems a reduced cashflow has proved fatal advisory firm frp which is handling carluccio 's administration said we are operating in unprecedented times and the issues currently facing the hospitality sector following the onset of covid-19 are well documented carluccios and brighthouse fall into administration putting over 4,000 jobs on the line petrol stations will have to close due to impact of covid-19 200 m of plants will be destroyed due to garden

employees business secretary alok sharma said the 12 month business rates break was designed to offer small businesses much needed support he said business rates can often be one of the main fixed

frontline nhs england staff have been tested for coronavirus despite 1.2 million people working for the health service it comes as the government is coming under increasing pressure to ramp up coronavirus tests as healthcare leaders warned there is no immediate prospect of mass nhs staff testing housing and communities secretary robert jenrick admitted on wednesday only 900 nhs staff had been tested over the weekend as the programme is rolled out he told radio 4s today programme clearly that s a low number but one we want to build on significantly chris hopson the chief executive of nhs providers which represents nhs trusts said maximum testing capacity in the uk was currently very constrained at around 13,000 tests per day ministers urged to step up covid-19 testing as boy 13 joins soaring death toll what is the strain of coronavirus known as covid-19 and what are the symptoms health secretary matt hancock who tested positive for the virus has now scrapped that cap telling nhs hospital labs to use all spare capacity to test their frontline workers mr jenrick reiterated the need to expand testing telling itv news that the government would be able to ramp up capacity to 25,000 a day by mid - april the minister said testing is essential to our strategy and that is why we are investing so much in it the number of tests in increasing it is rising this week it will reach 15,000 then 25,000 by mid - april he added mr jenrick denied the government and public health england phe would only agree to centralised testing after claims from scientists and universities that their offers of help have been rejected at present the focus is on testing patients in hospital to see if they have coronavirus with nhs trusts told earlier in the week they should use up to 15 % of any spare testing capacity for nhs staff he said the government was willing to work with any provider who had the right infrastructure and skills and urged them to get in touch asked when the national coronavirus testing centre near milton keynes would be fully operational mr jenrick replied i do nt know precisely when that s going to be coming on board the chief executive at nhs providers has said one nhs trust can only test three staff members a day due to a lack of swabs chris hopson told bbc radio 4s the world at one programme our sense is once that decision is made and that 15 % threshold is lifted then our trusts will be able to start testing a lot more staff but the key thing to understand is its the swabs and the reagent shortages that is the problem so i was talking to a trust this morning that can only test three members of staff a day because that s the number of swabs they ve got he added i was talking to the largest trust one of the largest trusts in the country this morning who basically want to test many many hundreds of their staff but they actually ca nt because they ve got a reagent shortage pm admits testing is way to unlock the coronavirus puzzle ' prime minister boris johnson who is self isolating after testing positive for covid-19 said testing was how we would unlock the coronavirus puzzle and defeat it in the end in a video message on twitter on wednesday night he said what we need to do is massively ramp up not just tests so you can know whether you ve had the disease in the past the so called antibody test because that will enable you to go to work

in various departments across the whole of whitehall on tuesday cabinet minister michael gove acknowledged at the daily number 10 news conference that the government needed to go further faster on testing but he warned that a shortage of the chemical reagents needed for the tests was proving to be a critical constraint on the governments ability to ramp up capacity nhs staff have expressed frustration that they are being forced to self isolate just as they are most needed because tests are not available to show whether they are clear of the disease mr hopson said of the weekend data only around 15 % of those in 14 day isolation tested positive so other 85 % could come back to work if anything like right a huge opportunity however before getting carried away remember testing capacity is still v constrained currently 13k / day and there are 1.2 million nhs staff so no immediate prospect of mass staff testing public health england phe has also come under fire over wider testing of members of the public with covid-19 phe has said repeatedly most adults in good health who develop symptoms will fully recover and do not need to be tested however many scientists disagree and have said it is only through widespread testing that the uk will be able to emerge from lockdown on tuesday former world health organisation director prof anthony costello said the uk has the capacity to test hundreds of thousands more people he said by mass testing we can detect new outbreaks and there will be much less disruption rather than isolating the whole economy we have 44 molecular virology labs in the uk if they were doing 400 tests a day we would be up to germany levels of testing around 70,000 a day and that is perfectly feasible coronavirus everything you need to

jenrick reitereated the need to expand testing saying that the government would be able to ramp up capacity to 25,000 a day by mid - april he said testing is essential to our strategy and that is why we are investing so much in it "the number of tests in increasing it is rising this week it will reach 15,000 then 25,000 by mid - april robert jenrick on government 's plan to increasing coronavirus testing capacity coronavirus everything you need to know check the number of cases in your area with our interactive map listen and subscribe to our podcast all the coronavirus information you need in one place from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus currently about 8,000 tests a day are being carried out despite ministers having previously claimed to have met a target of 10,000 a day a further target of 25,000 tests a day is not now expected to be reached until the end of april in contrast germany is testing about 70,000 a day with up to one in four hospital doctors reportedly off sick or self isolating chris hopson the chief executive of nhs providers expressed concern there was limited capacity to test staff he said when limited testing was introduced at the weekend it suggested many could safely go back to work what was interesting is that of the members of staff who had been self isolating for 14 days because they had a family member who potentially has coronavirus symptoms 15 % of them were positive he told bbc2s newsnight labour deputy leadership candidate and a&e doctor rosena allin khan shared a letter she has sent health secretary matt hancock asking how long nhs staff will have to wait for testing she said the lack of testing is having a huge mental health impact on our nhs workforce conservative former health secretary jeremy hunt said it was very worrying that the government was not pursuing a policy of mass testing he said it had been the key to finally controlling the outbreak in wuhan the chinese city where the disease first appeared it is internationally proven as the most effective way of breaking the chain of transmission he said however difficult it is to source the reagents to ramp up the capacity of laboratories up and down the country it is essential that mass community testing is part of our national strategy mr gove said prime minister boris johnson and mr hancock who are both self isolating after testing positive for covid-19 were working with companies worldwide to get the materials needed the chemical industries association acknowledged demand was escalating but said reagents were being manufactured and delivered to the nhs every business here in the uk and globally is looking at what they can do to help meet the demand as a matter of urgency it said to clarify the exact nhs need and meet it all relevant uk industries are continuing to work closely with government earlier it emerged that a 13-year old boy had died after testing positive for coronavirus ismail mohamed abdulwahab is thought to be the youngest reported victim of the disease in england his family said they have been left beyond devastated adding that to their knowledge he did not have any underlying health conditions government minister robert jenrick said the young boy 's death was tragic he said it underlines to all of us that it is indiscriminate we are all at risk and we all need to follow the government guidance mr jenrick added my heart goes out to the family as a parent to lose your child in these circumstances is exceptionally painful and tragic nhs england had earlier confirmed that a 19-year old had died after testing positive for covid-19 the italian chef named by news website la repubblica as luca di nicola was at that stage believed to be englands youngest victim who died in hospital with no existing medical issues ages of victims are not being routinely released in scotland wales or northern ireland the developments came as the department of health said a total of 1,789 patients had died overall in uk hospitals as of 5 pm on monday the increase of 381 on the day before by far the largest since the outbreak began nhs englands national medical director professor stephen powis said there were some green shoots with the number of new infections hitting a little bit of a plateau but he added even if that was sustained the number of deaths would continue to rise for some time to come its early days were not out of the woods were very much in the woods he said michael gove has said the difficulty in increasing the number of covid-19 tests is due to a shortage of the relevant chemical reagents asked about testing for nhs staff at the governments daily coronavirus briefing at downing street mr gove said we are increasing the number of tests one of the constraints on our capacity to increase testing overall is supply of the specific reagents the specific chemicals that are needed in order to make sure that tests are reliable coronavirus lockdown restrictions must not be relaxed says gove despite signs showing plateau in new cases well i 've just talked to the chemical industries association which represents the uk 's very substantial chemicals industry it has contacted its members and they 've said there is no shortage of the relevant reagents so the association has now been in touch with mr goves office to find out what he means because it is stumped the association also points out there was an industry chat with a business minister on tuesday who made no attempt to find out if there was a supply problem for the vital ingredients of covid-19 testing kits so this question of why there are n't enough tests for the virus is an even bigger mystery also if it turns out there is a shortage these manufacturers are more than happy to increase their production but they need to be asked which has not happened ps it was labour mp bill esterson who initially spotted this gap between what gove said and what the industry believes to be true pps so a government source says which is true that there is a global shortage of the reagent as it happens chief medical officer chris whitty said this a couple of weeks ago as has head of cdc in us but that still does n't explain why chemicals industry association thinks its members could help find a solution if asked by the government and it also does n't explain as i pointed out in a pm press conference earlier in the month why the government did n't forward plan by buying stocks of ingredients for the testing kits weeks ago before demand from rich countries soared the point is that if the government is thinking out of the box for the manufacture of ventilators potentially placing huge orders with the likes of f1 's mclaren mercedes and dyson why not do the same for covid-19 tests coronavirus everything you need to know check the number of cases in your area with our interactive map listen and subscribe to our podcast all the coronavirus information you need in one place from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus video report by itv news political correspondent angus walker words by westminster producer lewis denison there should be no relaxation of coronavirus lockdown measures in the uk cabinet minister michael gove has said despite signals the rate of infection is being slowed by social distancing mr gove who was speaking at the government 's daily covid-19 press conference said the sign of slowing infection rates was hopeful but warned against an over interpretation of figures there are some signs as a result of people observing social distancing that we may be able to flatten the spread of infection mr gove said but now is absolutely not the time for people to imagine there can be any relaxation or slackening the medical director of nhs england professor stephen powis said evidence showed the public is obeying new social distancing rules and as a result there had been a bit of a plateau in the number of new cases but he said it is really important not to read too much into statistics because it is really early days what do the new coronavirus death statistics tell us 19-year old among largest single day uk virus death toll rise it 'll get worse before it gets better but it will get better insists pm prof powis said that the rate of hospitalisation of cases for covid-19 was still increasing as was expected at this stage of the epidemic however he said that if the number of infections started to drop then in the next few weeks the hope was that the number of hospitalisations would also begin to fall but he said we are not out of the woods we are very much in the woods prof powis said the signs were positive but we must not be complacent and we must not take our foot off the pedal mr gove also admitted the uk must go further faster in its attempt to ramp up coronavirus testing capabilities for nhs frontline staff he said the rate of testing is increasing but admitted there was a long way to go the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster said more nhs staff are returning to the frontline and more testing is taking place to help those self isolating come back and to protect those working so hard in our hospitals and in social care but while the rate of testing is increasing we must go further faster he said a critical constraint on the ability to rapidly increase testing capacity is the availability of the chemical reagents but that prime minister boris johnson and health secretary matt hancock were working with companies worldwide to ensure the uk gets the material needed to increase tests of all kind another big issue for the nhs is the number of ventilators it has access to mr gove said the number had increased to just over 8,000 ventilators deployed in nhs hospitals but admitted we need more he said the uk had been buying new ventilators from abroad as well as beginning productions of its own the first new ventilator devices will roll off the production line this weekend and be delivered to the nhs next week mr gove said he said i can announce that this weekend the first of thousands of new ventilator devices will roll off the production line and be delivered to the nhs next week from there they will be rapidly distributed to the frontline words by itv news westminster producer lewis denison parents of children who are entitled to free school meals will now receive a weekly food voucher worth 15 to ensure youngsters do n't go hungry while their place of education is shut due to coronavirus the national voucher scheme will allow parents to buy food for their child either online with redeemable codes or with physical gift cards usable in supermarkets the vouchers can be spent on food at a range of shops including sainsburys tesco asda morrisons waitrose and m&s with the department for education working to get more on the scheme schools can still cook meals which can be delivered to homes or collected by parents the government says but where this is not possible families will be provided with a 15 voucher worth more than school meals during term time the government pays each school a flat rate of 2.30 per child per meal equalling 11.50 families will be given more than the rate paid to schools for free school meals because the government says it recognises that families will not be buying food in bulk and may therefore incur higher costs schools which will be emailed today with details of the scheme will be able to order vouchers individually online and have a code sent via email to each family it 'll get worse before it gets better but it will get better insists pm accusations of over zealous policing of social distancing alternatively they 'll be able to arrange a bulk order of multiple codes and receive an excel spreadsheet to help schools organise sending on to a family or create an egift card for a preferred supermarket to be posted to a family if parents can not get online when the government ordered the closure of all schools except in special circumstances it said it would be providing ongoing support to the 1.3 million children eligible for free school meals education secretary gavin williamson said he recognised how the unprecedented move of closing schools is dramatically affecting the lives of many families he said no child should go hungry as a result of the measures introduced to keep people at home protect the nhs and save lives coronavirus q&a 15 questions on work holidays and daily life answered coronavirus airport cargo services ' perilously close to collapse coronavirus deaths ' almost 20 % higher than reported in hospitals that s why we are launching this scheme to make sure children who usually benefit from free school meals still have access to healthy and nutritious meals while they are not attending school paul whiteman general secretary of the national association of headteachers welcomed the national voucher scheme he said this new system fills in one of the remaining gaps in the complex jigsaw puzzle of provision that has arisen from the covid-19 crisis there may be some kinks to work out of the scheme especially as it has been developed at pace but at least there is some certainty available now the boss of sainsbury 's mike coupe said we are proud to be involved in the governments brilliant initiative to help provide meals

our podcast all the coronavirus information you need in one place from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus words by itv news westminster producer lewis denison the number of coronavirus related deaths in the uk has been revealed to be significantly higher than government released figures had suggested new figures published by the office for national statistics showed there had been 210 deaths in england and wales up to and including march 20 while the government figure for the same period was 170 an increase of almost 20 % but the seemingly large disparity is easily explained by the differences in methods of counting and reporting the government figures published by nhs england and public health wales only relate to deaths which occur in hospitals where a patient has been diagnosed with covid-19 the ons figures for england and wales take into consideration all deaths in which covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate police face allegations of being over zealous at coronavirus social distancing coronavirus rulebreakers house parties and cross - country road trips boris johnson to chair cabinet by videolink as he self isolates the fact that there 's usually a delay of at least five days between a death occurring and it being registered also contributes to the difference in figures the ons figures only take into consideration deaths which have been registered but the government figures include all deaths that have occurred in a hospital the ons has minimised the disparity caused by a difference in methods of counting and reporting by including in its figures for deaths occurring up to and on march 20 deaths which were registered up to march 25 separate figures by the ons showed that of deaths registered up to march 20 42 % were people aged 85 and over while 31 % were people aged 75 - 84 however neither the ons figures nor the government 's give a real time snapshot of the number of deaths in covid-19 patients in the uk nor is it an accurate reflection of exactly where we are in the curve of the outbreak itv news political correspondent daniel hewitt explains why death figures differ new york governor begs for help amid staggering death toll medics feel strain as us braces for death toll that could top 100,000 this is mainly because neither figure reveals exactly how many deaths have occurred each day as they take in deaths from a range of dates this is usually over the previous few days but can sometimes be from weeks earlier for example the list of deaths announced by nhs england on march 29 included deaths that were recorded as taking place as far back as march 16 this is because a death is only included in the figures once families of the victim have been informed as a result the day on day change in the official death figures is not moving in step with how many coronavirus related deaths are taking place in real time march busiest month on record for supermarkets as worried shoppers stock up 75 m to help rescue stranded brits amid coronavirus lockdowns community centre appeals for help after overwhelming demand there is also a lag in ons figures of around 11 days the previous ons figures published on march 24 had numbers up to the week ending march 13 a third reason the official death figures do not give a real time snapshot of where we are in the curve of the outbreak is due to the amount of time that can pass between somebody contracting the virus and them dying as a result of a virus related issue as a result of this any steps taken to limit the spread of the virus such as social distancing or lockdowns take time to show up in the number of deaths boris johnson speaking via videolink from self isolation has warned members of his cabinet that the coronavirus pandemic in the uk is going to get worse before it gets better but the prime minister reassured a depleted cabinet room that the situation will get better as he hammered home the importance of social distancing the pm said the rising death toll in recent days showed the vital importance of the public continuing to stick to the social distancing guidance which has been put in place by the government based on scientific and medical advice a downing street spokesman said the pm said that the situation is going to get worse before it gets better but it will get better concerns had been raised about the use of zoom to conduct the meetings after the use of the software by ministry of defence staff was suspended last week while security implications were investigated but downing street said it was confident its communications links were secure after the first cabinet meeting where all ministers dialled in as part of the effort to limit the spread of coronavirus mr johnson posted a tweet after the meeting showing he and 24 other videolinks communicating via zoom accusations of over zealous policing of social distancing new york governor begs for help amid staggering death toll following the meeting it was announced that nhs visas are going to be extended until the end of the year children eligible for free school meals will benefit from a national voucher scheme allowing them to continue to access meals whilst they stay at home education secretary gavin williamson has announced schools can now provide every eligible child with a weekly shopping voucher worth 15 to spend at supermarkets while schools are closed due to coronavirus in the cabinet room itself there was only cabinet secretary sir mark sedwill and a small number of officials watching the prime minister most senior ministers are believed to have tuned in via videolink last week four people attended the meeting in person including mr johnson health secretary matt hancock cabinet secretary sir mark sedwill and chief medical officer professor chris whitty while others dialled in on the zoom app the pm and mr hancock have since tested positive for covid-19 while prof whitty is self isolating after developing symptoms in today 's meeting updates on the governments coronavirus response were given by videoconference by chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance and englands chief medical officer whitty earlier education secretary williamson said mr johnsons workload was undiminished despite him having to self isolate after becoming infected coronavirus deaths ' almost 20 % higher than reported in hospitals coronavirus airport cargo services ' perilously close to collapse the energy and the amount of work that is coming out of no 10 and the flat that he is isolated in has not tapered away he told the pa news agency i think self isolation has increased the prime ministerial work rate he is absolutely all over it mr williamson rejected criticism that mr johnson became infected because ministers ignored their own rules of social distancing we all recognise that london and particularly central london has been a real hotspot for the virus he said just the length of time the virus takes most people will have picked up the virus before these new rules have been put into place but it goes to highlight the importance of the new rules and the importance of people adhering to those rules on monday foreign secretary dominic raab who has been agreed as stand in prime minister should mr johnson become too ill to work said his boss had shown vigour in video conferences despite his diagnosis mr raab who says he is feeling terrific told the daily coronavirus press conference the prime minister chaired the 9.15am meeting and was full of vigour and was giving us the leadership we need and we are a united cabinet team in terms of getting the country through this crisis in a video post announcing his coronavirus diagnosis mr johnson told his twitter followers he had developed a temperature and a persistent cough he added i m working from home and self isolating and that s entirely the right thing to do but be in no doubt that i

with airlines including british airways virgin easyjet jet2 and titan to fly home tens of thousands of stranded british travellers mr raab said the government will provide up to 75 million in financial support to enable special charter flights to bring home stranded britons from places where commercial routes do not exist mr raab who was taking the lead on the government 's daily covid-19 press conference said chartered flights from priority countries took place over the weekend and would continue this week priority countries include peru india south africa ghana tunisia china japan cuba and ghana he said an unprecedented number of british travellers were trying to return to the uk and hundreds of thousands had already been assisted by the government emergency wards hit as one in four doctors off sick or in isolation what do the statistics really tell us about uk coronavirus deaths he said a foreign office call centre offering support to britons abroad received 15,000 calls last tuesday the highest number on record it is usually called 1,000 times a day so we boosted our resources we have redeployed people to our call centre we ve tripled our capacity he said yesterday the call centre answered 99 % of calls and helped thousands of british travellers get the answers they need mr raab said the priority on charter flights would always be the most vulnerable including the elderly or those with pressing medical needs he said priority would also be given to countries where there are large numbers of british tourists trying to return to the uk once special charter flights have been arranged we will promote them through the governments travel advice and by the british embassy or high commission in the relevant country he said british travellers who want a seat on those flights will book and pay directly through a dedicated travel management company he added we have designated 75 million to support those flights and the airlines in order to keep the costs down and affordable for those seeking to return to the uk he said 150,000 uk nationals had been assisted in getting home from spain 8,500 from morocco and 5,000 from cyprus the announcement came amid growing pressure from brits stranded in countries such as vietnam india laos and panama who have been unable to get home due to worldwide lockdowns we ve not faced challenges like this in getting people home from abroad on this scale in recent memory he said what are the signs and symptoms of covid-19 several social media users criticised the government for its slow response to stranded britons with one person branding the foreign office a shambles another user suggested the government should feel shame over its failure to bring his son home from nepal and compared the uk to germany a country that claims to have repatriated more than 160,000 of its nationals another user stranded in laos who has been appealing to the foreign office for help wrote on twitter how germany had responded to his pleas for help quicker than the uk sam jermy told itv news the asian country is going into national lockdown from wednesday and he 's worried he will be left without any options he

chose to contradict the there is no such thing as society endorsement of pure individualism from his conservative predecessor margaret thatcher we are going to do it we are going to do it together one thing i think the coronavirus crisis has already proved is that there really is such a thing as society mr johnson said mr johnson who is suffering with a temperature and persistent cough says thanks to the wizardry of modern technology he can continue to manage the response by communicating via video in recent years i 've been thinking about the right way to die having been with my late wife sian busby when she was in great pain from cancer at the end of her life and been chairman of hospice uk the charity which campaigns among other things to improve end of life care in normal times few of us want to dwell on better or worse ways to die but these are not normal times the coronavirus crisis means we have to confront perhaps the hardest question any of us will ever face for ourselves and for those we love most dearly if a doctor told us that our chances of survival were slim would we prefer to be kept alive possibly for just a few days more in a painful and humiliating way on an incubator or would we rather die at home with those we love doctors tell me they are presenting that choice to very sick people and their families in record numbers and many more still will have to make this most distressing of decisions i know this will alarm and even outrage many of you but in the short time we have before this epidemic reaches its peak it really matters that we think privately about all this and debate it publicly it is not macabre it is the essence of being human which is why below i am posting here a thoughtful piece by an old friend annabel about how she and her sister have resolved this question for themselves and for their mother who suffers from dementia and is in a care home her piece is upsetting but important thoughts on mortality by annabel s my mother is 82 she is a much loved mother and grandmother however she is also severely demented doubly incontinent and lives in a care home she is very different from the busy sociable mother of seven or so years ago but she is happy and has a good quality of life so good that when asked by the home in the autumn if we would like her to have a flu jab we said yes the care homes approach can not be faulted they have shut to visitors arranged skype sessions for families regularly posted photos of the activities going on facebook and sent out an anticipatory care planning questionnaire the questionnaire is familiar territory for my sisters and me my mother gave each of us a lasting power of attorney for health and welfare in 2012 a year later we first thought seriously about the possibility of her death when she had a triple heart bypass this lasting power of attorney allows us to make decisions for our mother about life sustaining treatment a couple of years later her gp asked if she wanted to put in place a dnr order do not resuscitate she did not have the capacity to make the decision so it fell to us we became aware while thinking about it that academic research suggests that putting in place a dnr order may result among other things in inappropriate withholding of other treatments so we designed our own advance treatment plan based on a more recent initiative called respect recommended summary plan for emergency care and treatment which had not at that point been rolled out by my mothers health authority and indeed has still not been rolled out countrywide why it should be the key point about it is that it is person centred this is what we said in choosing how to treat our mother in an emergency we would expect medical staff to prioritise her comfort and to focus on symptom control over any life sustaining treatment if the result of the latter is likely to be a materially impaired quality of life or if she is likely to find such treatment or the need to be in hospital to receive it unduly distressing in particular we would not wish her to be given an invasive treatment such as cpr with little or no chance of success in maintaining her existing quality of life coronavirus everything you need to know check the number of cases in your area with our interactive map listen and subscribe to our podcast all the coronavirus information you need in one place from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus by now you should be able to see where i am going if my mother were to fall ill with coronavirus she would be a high risk patient would we want her in hospital no imagine being a confused person in a place where you know no one everyone is busy and you ca nt understand why you are there or if you understand fleetingly you have forgotten a moment later the ventilators that are much talked about in the press are a highly invasive treatment a tube is put down a persons windpipe possibly through a cut in the throat and such treatment may well not save their life or if it does may leave them with severely impaired lungs and needing intensive physiotherapy i do nt think i need to ask you to imagine how traumatic my mother would find being ventilated even if she survived the process cabin crew asked to join coronavirus fight at nhs nightingale hospitals what are my travel rights amid the coronavirus pandemic the anticipatory care planning questionnaire from the care home asks if you were suffering from symptoms which should be what would you wish to happen the answer we have ticked is keep me comfortable treat any pain or other symptoms and care for me in my care home we have asked to be contacted quickly which of course the care home would do and to be consulted on how she would be isolated for the protection of others does this keep me awake at night no i firmly believe that my mother if she had the capacity would make the same decision for herself she would want to be in familiar surroundings with people who care about her the nurses and carers who look after her make her smile and i do believe they care about her it is hard to clean someones bottom if you do nt so that is the decision seen from her perspective there is another very important perspective from which it needs to be seen too and that is the perspective of the medical staff in the care home and those in the nhs who help them make treatment decisions it is in the dna of the nhs to try and save a persons life at almost any cost we know from italys experience that nhs staff are at risk of being faced with very difficult decisions about who to ventilate it will be incredibly helpful to them to know what their patients want and to be able to use that information to inform their decisions professor sir david king has been subject to some criticism for suggesting that patients of 90 or more could choose to stay at home if they fall ill with coronavirus he has raised an incredibly important point about personal choice in my opinion the spokesperson for ageuk who suggested that it is a purely medical decision ought similarly to be criticised for indicating that a persons own wishes are irrelevant as the respect process i have mentioned above makes clear what a person wants is very important respect is a formal person centred emergency care planning process to allow healthcare professionals to have conversations with patients about their preferences those decisions can then be used to inform clinical judgements and recommendations about future emergency care at a time when the person is not able to decide for themselves or communicate that decision it appears that in switzerland there is open debate about what sort of medical intervention a person might want if they fall ill with coronavirus and a third of the population have a living will the colloquial name for a legally binding advance decision to refuse medical treatment this conversation does not seem to be happening in the uk it needs urgently to start please do n't shirk your own responsibility to think about what you want if you are unlucky enough to fall seriously ill you owe it to yourself to those who love you do nt leave them guessing and to the nhs to work this out to be clear this is not about offering those at greater risk from coronavirus a different standard of health care it is about choice lets say you are unlucky enough to succumb to this illness if you are fortunate it will be mild but i would suggest you need to think in advance about what should happen if you become critically ill especially if you are someone for whom that risk is greater because of your age or health would you prefer to die at home surrounded by things that are familiar to you and the possibility of the company of people you love or are you prepared to risk a trip to a big busy and possibly overwhelmed hospital for invasive uncomfortable treatment that may not succeed or may succeed but leave your quality of life afterwards materially impaired anyone whose risks are so severe that they are being shielded and anyone of 70 or over or of any age with an underlying health condition listed in public health englands guidance on social distancing should be thinking about what kind of treatment they would be prepared to receive and how they see the balance between comfort and symptom control and the sustaining of life for some the decision will be easy for some it will be very hard indeed and for others it may be unbearable to think about it please do your best cabin crew asked to join coronavirus fight at nhs hospitals in the current circumstances the opportunity to discuss matters with your gp may be limited or non - existent but this should not stop you considering what you want the nhs website gives guidance about how to make an advance statement a written statement that sets down your preferences wishes beliefs and values regarding your future care an advance statement is not legally binding but must be taken into account by anyone who is making decisions about your care the nhs website also gives guidance about making an advance decision to refuse treatment or living will which is legally binding provided it covers the circumstances as they turn out to be neither an advance decision or an advance statement is any good unless you communicate it do nt simply tell a loved one who may be absent or uncontactable at the critical time crucially it needs to be available to anyone who needs to make decisions about your treatment to aid them in making those decisions and especially the emergency services my mother 's was kept with her most recent repeat prescription also useful to the emergency services in the fridge and all those caring for her knew where it was these steps are just as important as social distancing boris johnson has said the uk will get through the coronavirus crisis together after britons were warned restrictions on their lives may last for at least six months the prime minister issued the words of encouragement praising the 750,000 volunteers who have offered to assist the nhs from within downing street where he is isolating having tested positive for covid-19 deputy chief medical officer for england dr jenny harries said the nation will not be in complete lockdown for half a year but said social distancing measures will be lifted gradually her warning at sundays coronavirus press conference came as the nhs announced the first confirmed death of a frontline hospital worker with covid-19 cabinet minister robert jenrick said we simply can not and should not ask health workers to go to the frontline without adequate protective equipment as he announced the nation was put on an emergency footing in an unprecedented step in peace time dr harries said the three week reviews on the measures to slow the diseases spread are likely to continue for six months and their success would be judged on slowing its rate a sudden lifting she said could see the nations sacrifices wasted with another spike in deaths which have reached 1,228 we need to keep that lid on and then gradually we will be able to hopefully adjust some of the social distancing measures and gradually get us all back to normal she said three weeks for review two or three months to see if we ve really squashed it but three to six months ideally but lots of uncertainty in that but then to see at which point we can actually get back to normal and it is plausible it could go further than that in a video message from within his flat above no 11 the pm praised 20,000 former nhs staff who have returned to the service to tackle the pandemic and he chose to contradict the there is no such thing as society endorsement of pure individualism from his conservative predecessor margaret thatcher we are going to do it we are going to do it together one thing i think the coronavirus crisis has already proved is that there really is such a thing as society mr johnson said communities secretary mr jenrick announced that the emergency footing was now raised in all parts of the country this is an unprecedented step in peace time we have nt done

had not been in contact with patients in recent weeks mr jenrick said all nhs trusts and healthcare settings had received ppe deliveries and all social care sites will have received packages shortly we simply can not and should not ask people to be on the frontline without the right protective equipment he said mr el hawranis death came as the toll in uk hospitals reached 1,228 a rise of 209 this was the second biggest day on day jump but it was smaller than the 260 increase reported the day before but experts warned it was too early to claim the rate was decreasing and dr harries said she expected the coronavirus death toll to increase for the next week or two oxford university professor james naismith said it is far too early to conclude that the lower number today than yesterday is not simply due to chance cabinet office minister michael gove has admitted there was communication confusion after the government missed the deadline to join an eu scheme to get extra ventilators amid the coronavirus outbreak it comes after the official spokesperson for the prime minister said the uk had decided against joining the eu 's procurement scheme as the uk is no longer a member of the eu earlier this week the government has ordered 8,000 additional ventilators to boost the stock of 8,000 already available to the nhs pm pleaded we need ventilators says donald trump length of coronavirus lockdown measures ' not absolutely fixed says cabinet minister a no 10 spokespeson said officials did not get emails inviting the uk to join the eu scheme and it could opt in to future schemes it sparked calls from opposition mps including liberal democrat layla moran that the government is putting brexit ideology over demand for essential equipment the ventilators the nhs needs going into mass production and dyson is n't involved covid-19 uk doctors are deeply apprehensive about a surge in cases speaking on the andrew marr show on the bbc mr gove said there was some confusion over our involvement in that scheme but i 've talked to senior figures in the nhs and they 've reassured me that there is nothing that we ca n't do as an independent nation that being part of that scheme would have allowed us to do quizzed on whether an email was received by the government mr gove said there was some communication confusion i do n't know all the details of that he added i do know having talked to senior figures in the nhs that there 's nothing that participating in that scheme would have allowed us to do that we have not been able to do ourselves mr gove also issued an apology to a company which said it did not receive a reply from the government having offered to procure ventilators for the nhs an nhs supplier in nantwich said that in the international market it had found 25,000 ventilators which it could have procured for the government the supplier said that having asked the government if it wanted the ventilators it did not receive a reply mr gove told andrew marr i 'm very sorry if that company says that it did n't get a reply i 'll investigate as soon as i 've stopped talking to you it is the case that for companies that have got in touch with the government those offers of help have been forwarded to the relevant people in the nhs and in other aspects of government in order to make sure we secure those supplies dyson to build at least 15,000 ventilators to treat coronavirus patients companies bidding to make coronavirus ventilators must pass safety tests downing street says mr gove added that the company could get in touch directly and said we 'll investigate the cabinet minister said there have been some cases where people had hoped they might be able to help but in fact the material that they produce has not met the nhs specifications he continued we have been following up every single lead presented to us the number of virus related deaths in the uk rose by 209 on sunday bringing the total death toll since the

the prime minister who last week offered a glimmer of hope when he said he expects the uk can turn the tide within three months the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster warned that ministers would not hesitate to enforce tougher rules but said the evidence is people are obeying them the comments come as boris johnson penned a letter to all uk households warning things will get worse before they get

johnson moved fast enough to suppress coronavirus outbreak asks robert peston speaking to sky news mr gove said there are different projections as to how long the lockdown might last but it 's not the case that the length of the lockdown is something that is absolutely fixed it depends on all of our behaviour if we follow the guidelines we can deal more effectively with the spread of the disease what you can and ca n't do during the lockdown the cabinet minister told sky 's sophy ridge programme the government will adjust its guidelines on the basis of behaviour on the basis of data on the basis of facts on the basis of science mr gove declined to give a timeframe for the strict measures being lifted but insisted it is important that we do n't pre - empt discussion of what other steps may be required should measures be strengthened further speaking to bbc 's andrew marr later on sunday morning mr gove added that the public must prepare for a significant period of lockdown we are all at risk boris johnson and matt hancock and test positive for virus not only could the lockdown period lengthen the conditions of it could become stricter in a bid to keep the number of deaths and

added if we do that we can all play our part in helping the nhs the uk has hit its initially 10,000-a day testing target mr gove said but he refused to give a timeline for when all nhs and social care workers will be tested despite increasing demands the minister also commented on the current functioning of government with both boris johnson and health secretary matt hancock in isolation after testing positive for covid-19 mr gove said the prime minister remained very firmly in charge and would hold another meeting by video conference on sunday he also confirmed that foreign secretary dominic raab is the designated deputy should mr johnson 's condition worsen and he could no longer govern asked if the government had been observing its own coronavirus guidance after ministers developed symptoms mr gove told the bbc 's andrew marr we 've been doing everything we can to observe that advice and it 's certainly the case that within the house of commons people were seeking to

health conditions the announcement comes as an nhs boss said keeping uk coronavirus deaths below 20,000 would be a good result business secretary alok sharma has said that there will be new measures to improve the insolvency system to help businesses hit by the coronavirus crisis mr sharma announced changes to insolvency rules to allow firms greater flexibility as they face the current crisis it is crucial when the crisis passes as it will we are ready to bounce back he said as he detailed measures to help businesses emerge intact the other side of the covid-19 pandemic these measures will give those firms extra time and space to weather the storm and be ready when the crisis ends whilst ensuring creditors get the best return possible in the circumstances he continued the new rules will allow companies undergoing restructuring to continue access to supplies and raw materials uk coronavirus deaths pass 1,000 mark as britons told stay home nhs frontline staff become first to get coronavirus ' antigen test and he said there would be a temporary suspension of wrongful trading provisions for company directors to remove the threat of personal liability during the pandemic which will apply retrospectively from march 1 however to be clear all of the other checks and balances that help to ensure directors fulfil their duties properly will remain in force companies required to hold annual general meetings will be be able to do so flexibly in a matter compatible with public health guidance mr sharma said this might include postponing or holding the agm online or by phone using only proxy voting he said mr sharma said it was incumbent on businesses permitted to remain open during the shut down to keep their employees safe he said most businesses were adapting and where necessary issuing staff with personal protective equipment if there are instances where organisations and businesses are not behaving appropriately in terms of their duty of care then of course there are organisations like the hse health and safety executive who should be informed coronavirus everything you need to know check the number of cases in your area with our interactive map listen and subscribe to our podcast all the coronavirus information you need in one place from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus my jaw slightly dropped on friday when michael gove announced that the number of covid-19 cases in the uk was now doubling every three to four days this is significantly faster than the five days that was initially built into the government 's forecasts for the rate of increase in sufferers and the 4.3 days that epidemiologist neil ferguson told me on 17 march was the new estimated baseline doubling time on the one hand this accelerated rate of infection explains why the government moved to enforce much more severe measures to restrict social interaction just over a week ago because presumably its scientific advisers had more than an inkling that the virus was spreading significantly faster than would allow hospitals to cope to be clear the acceleration in the number of reported cases does not mean the new restrictions on our ability to mix with people have failed the chief medical officer chris whitty and chief science adviser patrick vallance believe there is a two to three week lag between the introduction of social distancing measures and the rate at which the virus spreads through the population but it is now 12 days since boris johnson announced a first round of restrictions on our ability to socialise or be close to other people and so it would be concerning if the rate of spread of the infection did not slow at all next week two more uk facilities to be converted into nhs nightingale ' coronavirus hospitals if vallance 's heuristic that for every death there are probably 1000 infections in the country though many not showing up in official figures holds true that means there are currently more than 750,000 people with the virus in the uk and there will be well over a million within a day or two of course many of that million would not show symptoms for days and many will never show symptoms though as i 've written before one of the great frustrations for the government in managing the crisis is it does n't know how many people get the virus without experiencing symptoms but let 's assume that the government 's scientific advisory group on emergencies is correct and 8 % of those with the virus will require hospitalisation that would imply that in the coming three weeks the nhs would have to treat some 80,000 sufferers which would exhaust the 33,000 nhs beds that have been liberated or created for covid-19 patients that said i am unclear whether the denominator for that 8 % includes those with the virus who will never show symptoms namely the asymptomatic photos show progress as london 's excel centre is converted into a coronavirus hospital but even if the 8 % applies only to those with symptoms it is already pellucidly clear that the nhs will struggle to cope even with the addition of the new beds at the nightingale hospitals which are being created at exhibition centres for what it 's worth the government is working on the assumption it will know in a fortnight if it has done enough to flatten the peak of the outbreak i fear we 'll know whether johnson and his team have taken adequate pre - emptive action somewhat earlier ps i was using friday 's infection and mortality stats when writing but with saturday 's news that there have been 1,019 deaths since the outbreak began we are already at 1 m uk people infected if patrick vallance 's heuristic or rule of thumb is correct coronavirus everything you need to know check the number of cases in your area

frontline staff will this weekend be tested for coronavirus as the government aims to ramp up diagnosing capabilities with antigen testing cabinet minister michael gove announced in yesterday 's daily coronavirus press conference that the government had brought together universities businesses and research institutes in a new alliance to boost testing capacity for frontline workers mr gove said testing is absolutely crucial to our response to and fight against coronavirus the infection rate of which he says is doubling every three to four days he said tests will be trailed on frontline staff immediately with the hope that hundreds will have taken place by the end of the weekend he said that number will be dramatically scaled up next week to ensure health and social care workers can have security in the knowledge that they are safe to return to work if their test is negative coronavirus strikes heart of government but top team to continue fightback from isolation how pm will lead uk through coronavirus from self isolation among the first to receive the tests will be critical care nurses intensive care staff ambulance workers and gps the first of three new testing laboratories

people have tested positive for the virus simon stevens chief executive of the nhs said it is urgently important that those off work sick can be tested for coronavirus dad with coronavirus symptoms 27 dies ten days after birth of son italy passes china 's confirmed cases of infection mr stevens also revealed how 33,000 coronavirus beds had been made available in the nhs with additional beds to come as more facilities are converted into temporary hospitals after work began on london 's excel centre becoming an nhs nightingale hospital mr stevens said he had given the go ahead to two more one in manchester 's central convention complex and one in birmingham 's nec he said the extraordinary action of converting sites into field hospitals in very short order had been taken because the problem is not just confined to london what is an antigen test antigen testing reveals whether particular antigens are in a person 's blood according to patient.info antigens are particles that stimulate antibodies part of the immune system that fights infection to be created in the body if particular antigens and antibodies can be detected in the blood it can indicate the presence of a particular infection antigens can be detected in the blood before antibodies have been created and so antigen tests can more quickly reveal if an infection is present antigen tests are good to show whether a person currently has a virus whereas antibody tests are better at showing whether a person has had a virus on the new tests mr stevens said i can say that today we will be rolling out staff testing across the nhs starting next week with the critical care nurses other staff in intensive care emergency departments ambulance services gps as testing volumes continue to increase we want to widen that to essential public service workers as well as our social care workers and continue with patient testing that is so vital the news was announced at a press conference in which the prime minister his health secretary and chief medical officer were absent due to coronavirus boris johnson and matt hancock have tested positive for the virus while chief medical officer chris whitty is self isolating

fightback against covid-19 from isolation after becoming infected with the deadly virus with the spread of the virus doubling every three to four days as was revealed by stand in michael gove at yesterday 's coronavirus press conference it 's no surprise that health secretary matt hancock also has also contracted it one of their top coronavirus advisers has also been forced into self isolation after also experiencing mild symptoms but like the pm and health secretary chief medical officer chris whitty will continue to work from home mr johnson who is suffering with a temperature and persistent cough says thanks to the wizardry of modern technology he can continue to manage the response by communicating via video mr gove said the diagnoses of his colleagues shows that the virus does not discriminate adding we are all at risk on saturday scottish secretary alister jack revealed he has developed mild symptoms associated with coronavirus and is self isolating how pm will lead uk through coronavirus from self isolation saturday newspapers focus on coronavirus in government with 55-year old mr johnson testing positive for the virus on thursday evening questions have been raised as to who else he may have infected it is believed his girlfriend carrie symonds considered vulnerable due to her pregnancy is safe after it was reported she moved out of downing street several days ago before the pm was experiencing symptoms mr johnson 's spokesman said he is living in the flat in 11 downing street and with the chancellor moving out the whole building will serve as his office and house meals and work would be left at the door it is thought the queen is also likely to have avoided being infected by the prime minister a no 10 spokesman said mr johnson had been conducting his weekly audiences with her majesty by telephone for at least the last fortnight concerns have been raised about which cabinet minister will be stricken next with chancellor rishi sunak spending time with the pm as recently as thursday evening and home secretary priti patel sitting close to him on wednesday at pmqs biggest daily rise in uk virus death toll brings total to 759 two

able to be tested swiftly this will be antigen testing testing whether people currently have the disease so that our health and social care workers can have security in the knowledge that they are safe to return to work if their test is negative he said trials of the tests will begin immediately with hundreds to take place by the end of the weekend dramatically scaling up next week and following much speculation the press conference also confirmed the creation of two new coronavirus field hospitals after work began converting london 's excel centre into a 4,000 bed ' nhs nightingale

by nearly 3000 bringing the number of confirmed cases in the uk to 14,579 at the the daily press conference mr gove declined to be drawn on whether mps had been too slow in practising social

still be able to work with his top team through the wizardry of modern technology mr hancock echoed the prime minister saying he had only mild symptoms sir patrick vallance said mr johnson was already using digital tools to manage meetings biggest daily rise in uk virus death toll brings total to 759 while he self isolates officials will be working to ensure mr johnson has access to the information he needs as well as staying in touch with key personnel this includes cabinet ministers political advisers such as dominic cummings englands chief medical officer professor chris whitty as well as sir patrick how is the prime minister staying in touch with his colleagues earlier this week the prime minister was pictured speaking to the cabinet using the zoom video conferencing platform that has exploded in popularity during the virus outbreak this was despite ministry of defence staff being banned from using it amid security fears alan woodward professor of cyber security at the university of surrey said the government would be able to rely on secure telephone units to help mr johnson make important phone calls from downing street inside government they have a secure telephone system it used to be called brent two he said the prime minister is lucky he lives above the shop he s got one there and it does nt take much to fit them so people like matt hancock doubtless has one so just talking is simple and you can talk at the highest levels of classification on it the queen has already been pictured at windsor castle holding her weekly audience with the prime minister by telephone prof woodward acknowledged that the use of zoom by cabinet had raised eyebrows with the company having fairly serious security problems in the past prof woodward said i m sure that the national cyber security centre will be looking at these things to make sure there are no holes prof woodward said officials will be ensuring communications channels use encryption and will be relying on the existing government secure intranet for some emails catherine haddon a senior fellow at the institute for government suggested the prime minister would be receiving more digital information in the near future she also said the earlier selection of foreign secretary dominic raab as a stand in for mr johnson in case he became unwell solved any political problems among ministers they were already doing a certain amount of remote working we know that cabinet has been using video conferencing so has the g7 g20 she said raab to take over as pm ms haddon emphasised that mr johnson said his conditions were mild so his workload capacity was unlikely to change much she explained the governments cabinet system allowed ministers to deputise for the prime minister should he become more unwell such as by chairing the cobra committee ms haddon added i assume that one of the reasons for naming raab as the designated survivor the phrase that has been used possibly inappropriately is to avoid any political battle if there was suddenly a vacuum at the top its more about the political leadership in all of this rather than constitutional or government decision making processes she added by saying that it will be raab they are giving him some political legitimacy to avoid any battles over that so you do nt have cabinet then being undecided as to who that person should be video report by itv news political correspondent carl dinnen prime minister boris johnson and health secretary matt hancock have tested positive for coronavirus while the government 's chief medical officer chris whitty

employed sector so what are the measures and how will they help workers or work for themselves what has the government announced chancellor rishi sunak set out plans that will see the self employed receive up to 2,500 per month in grants for at least three months the scheme is set to bring self employed workers into line with those who are full time employed meaning that they will not be worse off after being told they are unable to work to help control the virus the scheme will be open to those with a trading profit of less than 50,000 in the last tax year or the same amount as an average of the past three tax years who qualifies for the support to be eligible for the support the government says workers will have to earn more than half of their income in these periods must come from self employment in a bid to minimise fraud only those who are already in self employment and meet the above conditions will be eligible to apply the government has said hmrc will contact those eligible with guidance on how to apply for the scheme in a statement the government said individuals should not contact hmrc now and that the taxman will contact them directly after correlating a list

three months and will start to be paid in late june before grant payments are made the self employed will still be able to access other available government support for those affected by coronavirus including an extended universal credit service and business continuity loans where they have a business bank account what other support has the government offered the government has already set out plans for 80 % wage subsidies or up to 2,500 per month for staff kept on by employers as part of unprecedented measures to prevent workers being laid off due to the virus crisis the measures are expected the save millions of jobs from the axe allowing the economy to be kickstarted again once the lockdown is ended coronavirus and claiming benefits everything you need to know what to do if you

report by itv news political correspondent paul brand self employed workers will have 80 % their average earnings paid for by the government as it aims to support workers through the coronavirus crisis the new package means self employed people will now be supported in a similar way to workers who are having their wages paid for by the government for 80 % of their salary or up to 2,500 a month the government had been under increasing pressure to extend financial protection to the self employed sector after it was seemingly left out of a package of support provided to most other workers the chancellor says 95 % of all self employed workers will be covered by the scheme which is expected to be up and running by the beginning of june he added that self employed people can now access universal credit in full and will be able to claim before the new scheme comes into play what should you do if you think you have coronavirus coronavirus advice all the information you need in one place he said that it is open to anyone with trading profits of up to 50,000 and will be only available to those who make the majority of their income from self employment so only the genuinely self employed benefit to minimise fraud only those who are already in self employment who have a tax return for 2019 will be able to apply he said 95 % of people who are majority self employed will benefit from this scheme but he warned the government will not be able to protect every single job or save every single business mr sunak said the average earnings of those not covered by the state aid were those earning more than 200,000 per year of the people it does not cover those last 5 % those above the income threshold we set their average incomes are about 200,000 said the chancellor coronavirus who should be at work what help for the self employed and when did prince charles last see the queen listen to the calling peston podcast those who became self employed since april 2019 are not eligible for the scheme the new package received immediate criticism for its three month time scale shadow chancellor john mcdonnell said waiting until june will simply be too late for millions he said asking people to rely on universal credit when more than 130,000 people are queuing online will be worrying to many people so there is a real risk that without support until june the self employed will feel they have to keep working putting their own and others ' health at risk mp amy callaghan said it was simply not good enough that self employed workers would have to wait until june for support the snp mp tweeted waiting until june for self employed people to get support is unfathomable my constituents are struggling now simply not good enough several other opposition mps expressed dismay that self employed workers would have to wait until june to claim labour mp david lammy tweeted leaving the five million self employed brits without any support until june is a slap in the face many will be bankrupt by then and why is there an eligibility cap for the self employed but not the employed this is not what i call fair liberal democrat mp and leadership candidate layla moran posted 80 % grant for the self employed is welcome but waiting until june does not give self employed parity with those in employment she added that it was a huge missed opportunity to implement a universal basic income the government will calculate a self employed workers ' average earnings over three years mr sunak said those eligible will be contacted by hmrc and the money will be paid into their bank accounts and he said anyone who missed januarys filing deadline will have four weeks to submit their tax return so no one misses out on support as he announced the package in a digital downing street press conference he revealed details of the package on his twitter page the press conference was held in a digital format to help ensure journalists are able to follow the strict rules of social distancing the move comes after prime minister boris johnson told parliament he wanted to achieve parity of support so the self employed could have similar levels of protection to waged workers last week the government set out plans for 80 % wage subsidies or up to 2,500 per month for staff kept on by employers as part of unprecedented measures to prevent workers being laid off due to the virus crisis the chancellor later said drawing up plans to help self employed people had proved to be incredibly complicated it comes amid a day of good news for the government 's battle against covid-19 with life saving ventilators going into mass production and the uk becoming the world 's biggest donor to efforts for a vaccine health official says encouraging signs in europe over outbreak north yorkshire police to introduce lockdown checkpoints speaking on wednesday the prime minister promised the government would do whatever we can to support the self employed just as we are putting our arms around every single employed person in this country as the commons shut down early for easter due to the escalating epidemic mr johnson told mps there are particular difficulties with those who are not on paye schemes as i think the whole house understands we are bringing forward a package to ensure that everybody gets the support that they need but cautioned i can not in all candour promise the house that we will be able to get through this crisis without any kind of hardship at all the military have been drafted in to deliver vital personal protective equipment ppe including 10 million masks to medics on the coronavirus frontline the housing secretary has told itv 's peston robert jenrick said the government were ramping up efforts very significantly in order to meet the extra demand for ppe he told anushka asthana we need to get more ppe out to people working on the frontline that 's in hospitals it 's in social care it 's in pharmacies and gp 's surgeries he said we are doing that we are ramping up efforts very significantly we 're taking very large stocks now over 10 million masks for example in the last few days and we 've now got the military involved in delivering this to the frontline there 's reason to believe that is succeeding we delivered stocks to hospitals in the last few days every social care provider in the country will get deliveries this week we now have a ppe hotline so that those people on the front line can ring up get the order that they desperately need but former health secretary jeremy hunt said that he was hearing from the british medical association that there are still shortages of goggles if you 're looking after a patient who sprays you or spits on you or coughs on you you should wear goggles he said we 've got chaand nagpaul the president of the british medical association speaking to the select committee tomorrow morning and we 're obviously be asking him about that mr hunt added following the prince of wales ' positive test for coronavirus questions have been raised about testing in the uk at the moment only patients in hospital are being routinely tested the housing secretary said the government 's next priority was to ensure nhs workers were tested we 're ramping up production again very rapidly in the days and weeks ahead we 'll try to ensure that all nhs professionals get tested he said shadow secretary of state for education angela rayner mp said the recent announcement that a test might be imminent was woefully inadequate what we need to do is make sure our essential public service workers get those tests immediately so that we can track the virus and that we can protect our frontline workers including teachers and support staff that are on the front line protecting our citizens against this virus abandoned doctors will leave due to lack of protective gear intensive care doctor tells itv news the worst is yet to come the rise in uk coronavirus related deaths from 422 to 465 a jump of 43 is the smallest day on day increase in the number of deaths since march 20 mr hunt said the government were monitoring what happens in wuhan where strict quarantine measures have been relaxed as the results would show whether the uk will be on and off lockdown for the next year the big thing that will have some light on in about month 's time is whether once you 've suppressed the virus and then you lift the social distancing measures it starts to come back he said and that 's the thing we 'll find out because they 're just starting to lift some of the extreme measures in wuhan schools are going back in china and we 're looking very carefully at countries like hong kong to see whether it comes back last week the government introduced measures to help tenants who may be financially impacted by the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak the move came after criticism that they were not protecting renters who are often among the most vulnerable members of society asked what protection tenants will have against being evicted under new legislation mr jenrick said what we 've introduced through the emergency legislation is a complete moratorium on evictions for three months with the power to extend that by another three months if we need to if in three months ' time the coronavirus crisis is still with us so absolutely nobody should be concerned about being evicted from their home for at least the next three months he said the three month ' rent holiday would be reviewed after three months the prime minister has said 405,000 people have volunteered for the nhs through the coronavirus crisis the announcement comes after the government asked 250,000 people to come forward to help the health service as it faces its biggest challenge since its inception mr johnson speaking at the daily press conference inside number 10 said he wanted to offer a special thank you to everyone who has now volunteered to help the nhs when we launched the appeal last night we hoped to get 250,000 volunteers over a few days but i can tell you that in just 24 hours 405,000 people have responded to the call coronavirus testing kits are coming despite global bottleneck the uks chief medical officer professor chris whitty said there was a global bottleneck on buying more testing kits speaking at the press conference he said it was the governments aim to be able to buy tests that would allow nhs workers to go back to work if they test negative for coronavirus this is a global problem every country wants this new test for a disease that was nt being tested for anywhere three months ago he said everybody wants it so there is a global shortage and that s a bottleneck for us the next priority is to get critical workers back to work or to say to them you have got it we definitely would like that protect yourselves and others ' 21-year old virus victim 's family authorities have said more than 8,000 people have contracted the deadly virus in the uk so far the youngest victim has been named by her family as a 21-year old from high wycombe in buckinghamshire chloe middleton had no pre - existing health conditions her family said in a statement released on social media the conference comes after the government introduced a lockdown on the united kingdom seeing the majority of shops and businesses closed bar those deemed essential millions of

wednesday commons leader jacob rees mogg has tabled a motion for the house of commons to rise on wednesday until april 21 the move would see mps break from their duties in westminster almost a week early the initial recess date for easter had been set for tuesday march 31 it comes after prime minister boris johnson urged people to stay in their homes unless absolutely necessary in a bid to prevent the further spread of covid-19 emergency coronavirus legislation to be rushed through commons amid calls for tougher measures emergency coronavirus bill to give government new powers to arrest and isolate people mps have been following party guidance on attending debates in a bid to limit those in the chamber at any one time special measures were brought in this week to stagger voting so politicians could adhere to government advice on social distancing including remaining two metres away from each other in the division lobbies the coronavirus bill is expected to receive royal assent and become law before the end of wednesday mps from all sides agreed to let it pass without formal votes the bill will see the powers of ministers councils police health professionals and coroners temporarily strengthened during the uk 's current lockdown designed to stall the spread of covid-19 communities secretary robert jenrick said he was certain mps would return after the easter recess to review whether parliament should reopen during the pandemic the cabinet minister told bbc breakfast once that 's happened the passing of the coronavirus bill then it may be a sensible thing to close parliament down for the recess and then review that at the end of the recess after easter most of us i think do want parliament to continue we live in a democracy it essential there 's scrutiny of the steps that the government is taking government defends allowing construction work to continue during coronavirus lockdown police enforce government 's coronavirus lockdown rules he added but obviously parliament has to lead by example follow the guidelines wherever it can and ensure that we protect the staff that work in parliament as well mr jenrick said he was unaware of whether mr rees mogg would call for a fixed return date he added it was his opinion that parliament should return in some form after recess mr jenrick told the bbc i think its really important however deep and serious this crisis that parliament in some form continues to operate because you as citizens want to ensure your mps are holding the government to account is coronavirus slowing down my internet and what can i do to make it run faster in a statement on monday commons speaker lindsay hoyle said work would take place while mps were away to improve video conferencing for committee hearings he stressed however that technical teams were under strain due to staff shortages related to the coronavirus outbreak it is not known whether the speaker would consider allowing mps to hold commons debates via video conference coronavirus everything you need to know check the number of cases in your area with our interactive map listen and subscribe to our podcast all the coronavirus information you need in one place from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus there are still potentially lethal ambiguities in the government 's coronavirus advice about who should go to work such is the judgement of leading employers to whom i 've spoken the fundamental question is whether businesses that are not doing work considered of national importance but which involve employees working cheek by jowl in sweaty conditions should cease operating the head of one of the uk 's largest companies is absolutely clear to me that the government has given a signal that such operations should send staff home and switch off the machines but a distraught mother of an employee of an midland steelworks forwarded me a message from the firm boss saying they were staying open because they are not in prime minister 's list of sectors ordered to shut and we therefore all need to be there the all in this case include many men in their forties fifties and sixties who are thought to be particularly at risk from covid-19 the government has moved into a phase of banning people from being in groups pretty much anywhere but the home tokyo olympic games postponed about a year over virus fears stay at home texts sent to millions as lockdown begins so what is it about the steelworks or any other business requiring close physical contact that is n't engaged in work vital to the health and security of the nation that justifies it staying open in china you 'll recall pretty much all manufacturing ceased in hubei during the lockdown one answer is that some economic activity has to be sustained in the uk or an economic contraction and reduction in our prosperity that is already likely to be more acute even than any phase of the great depression could be so extreme as to set back recovery for months and years but of course this entire dilemma highlights yet again what many are describing as the scandal of how slow the government has been to increase the uk 's covid-19 testing capacity the biggest advantage of being able to mass test is that if someone falls ill at the factory he or she could be tested those in contact with the ill person could be tested too and a rational decision could be taken on whether the factory could continue operating absent that ability the safety first principle argues for mass closures of all services and manufacturing that requires any kind of human contact with devastating economic consequences in other words whatever the short term financial costs of ramping up testing the long term economic damage of not having sufficient testing capacity outweighs it by a hundred or thousand times the former health secretary jeremy hunt pointed out to me this morning that this weekend the uk was still carrying out only five and a half thousand tests per day nowhere near the pm 's recently announced targets of 10,000 a day and 25,000 a day health officials warn coronavirus outbreak accelerating doctor separates from daughter for 12 weeks over virus risks support for self employed incredibly complicated says chancellor gove u turns after saying children can not travel between parents this is woefully inadequate if the chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance was correct when he told mps a few days ago that there were probably 1000 infections in the population for every death because it would suggest the number of cases here most unidentified is already in the hundreds of thousands another measure of the testing shortfall is that the uk is carrying out about 40,000 tests a week less than a quarter of the tests being made in germany where as it happens the mortality rate from covid-19 is a fraction of the mortality rate here presumably because the tests allow the hospital system to identify vulnerable sufferers before they enter the most acute phase of the illness the priority of course is for us to pull together to get through this crisis as best we can so this may not be the optimal time for recriminations and the search to identify those who for reasons best known to them did not identify several weeks ago the importance of testing and therefore did not ramp up the uk 's inadequate capacity but for what it 's worth even 12 days ago when i highlighted the government 's plan to go for so called herd immunity by managing the rate of spread of the infection as opposed to the volte face just over a week ago to suppression of the virus it would have been rational to accompany that policy with a system for real time monitoring of who actually has it let 's come back to the who why and what when we have time and space to breathe and think but in the meantime the imperative for journalists like me is to test that when the prime minister announces as he did last week that he had made a priority of moving to mass testing that these are not just words and something actually changes words by itv news westminster producer lewis denison with the uk locked down amid the coronavirus pandemic many people working from home for the first time are now realising their internet speeds are not as fast as they 'd like after prime minister boris johnson ordered everyone to work from home if at all possible it is likely hundreds of thousands more people than usual are using their home wi fi during work hours not only this but after schools were closed many children have been using the internet to access their work while the order for people to stay at home will likely see video streaming services used more frequently and despite many vocal twitter users complaining about their internet speeds broadband companies claim they are coping fine with increased demand across their networks caused by coronavirus openreach a firm which looks after local network access for 640 service providers said it was not seeing any significant issues across our broadband or phone network it said there had been a 20 % increase in daytime usage but that is in line with what we expected and not as high as the usage levels we see during evening peak times despite networks appearing as though they can cope with increased demand several internet firms have announced they 're making changes to the way they work to reduce pressure on networks facebook has become the latest service to lower video bitrates to help prevent internet congestion during the coronavirus lockdown the social media giant said it would temporarily reduce the video quality of content on facebook and instagram in europe it follows netflix amazon prime video and youtube confirming similar moves last week after concerns were raised about the ability of internet networks to handle increases in user traffic as millions stay at home during the covid-19 outbreak bitrate is the amount of data streamed per second when watching a video online virgin media one of the uk 's biggest internet service providers told itv news that while daytime downstream traffic the volume of traffic downloaded from the internet had recently increased by around 50 % it is still significantly below levels experienced in the evening peak a spokesperson said our network is built to withstand evening and weekend peaks when our customers use their broadband most intensively as such any usage increase seen in the daytime caused by more people working from home for example will be catered for from our existing network capacity virgin media said with more people working from home it had noticed increased network demand during the day from around 8 am it also said demand on its landline network had seen large growth with people using their home phone 80 % more week on week peaking at 10 am with just under 2.5 million calls per hour it also said its customers are spending nearly twice as much time on their landline phones in the early evening with phone call minutes up by as much as 94 % despite networks being maintained more people using your home internet at the same time means your signal is being shared and as a result so is your internet speed but there are several things you can do at home to improve your internet speed first identify the problem check your internet speed there are various reasons behind why your computer could be running slowly so do n't spend ages trying to improve your internet speed when something else could be the problem there are dozens of websites offering to test your internet speed for you such as speedtest.net but the easiest way to do it is by searching google if you search test internet speed google will ask you to click a button that says run speed test if the result is your internet speed is slow then you should carry on reading this guide contact your internet service provider again do n't waste your time with the following techniques before checking with your internet service provider whether there is a problem at their end you can do this by phoning them up however many providers also have this function on their website if you search the name of your internet provider followed by service status you should find a web page that asks you to enter your postcode and in turn you 'll be told if there are network problems in your area if there are no problems in your area try the following steps reboot your router the age old quick fix is back if something is n't working switch it off then turn it on again while it may be a running joke among it people restarting your internet really does work quite often according to bt make sure you wait at least five seconds before switching your box back on if that does n't work there are other things you can try find the best place for your router to get the best out of your internet connection you should make sure your router is not being obstructed by anything keep it in an open location in your home virgin media says you should keep it out of cabinets next to the telly not behind it and away from baby monitors and fish tanks these objects can block and slow down your wi fi signal you should also make sure your router is stood up the way the provider has intended do n't sit it on its side to save space and even put it on a table or shelf rather than the floor your microwave can also reduce your wifi speed so try not to use it when on video calls or while you 're doing something important online identify wi fi blackspots ' one reason your internet may be running slowly is that you could be working in a wi fi blackspot according to bt its often an area that is too far away from the router or separated by thick walls a simple solution to this is to work in a different room closer to your internet router even opening the door in the room you 're working in could help improve your connection alternatively you can buy a booster from your service provider for around 30 that should improve your coverage move to a wired connection while it may not be ideal using an ethernet cable to connect your device is the best way this way according to virgin media your device will get the fastest speeds whilst freeing up your wi fi for other devices for people working from home and sharing large files connecting their laptop with a wired connection will help them get the best speeds the firm said its also worth connecting devices which use more data like games consoles and smart tvs with an ethernet cable video report by itv news correspondent ben chapman struggling self employed people will have to wait for the government to come up with a deliverable and fair coronavirus support package chancellor rishi sunak has said boris johnsons government has come under sustained pressure to provide financial help for self employed workers who face a dramatic loss of income if forced to take time off for sickness or quarantine mr sunak told mps it is incredibly complicated to design a system to support the self employed but insisted that intensive work is going on in whitehall government sends out stay at home texts as lockdown begins he said ministers are in dialogue with all the key stakeholder groups there are genuine practical and principled reasons why it is incredibly complicated to design an analogous scheme to the one that we have for employed workers but rest assured that we absolutely understand the situation that many self employed people face at the moment as a result of what s happening and are determined to find a way to support them he told the commons we just need to be confident that can be done in a way that is deliverable and is fair to the vast majority of the british workforce across the capital on tuesday the first day of the lockdown

swift clarity for millions of insecure and uncertain workers about whether they can be at work or not and without removing the agonising choice between health and hardship then the positive measures

health emergency workers need clear direction and protection from government now rachel reeves labour chairwoman of the commons business energy and industrial strategy committee has written to business secretary alok sharma calling for ministers to extend the income protection scheme to cover the self employed and to increase the rate of statutory sick pay she said the chancellors package last week to support businesses and employees was welcome but with self employed and freelancers still not covered by support even as many of their businesses are now subject to lockdown there is a worrying gap in the governments strategy to protect these livelihoods which urgently needs to be put right raising the issue in the commons labour mp wes streeting ilford north said one newspaper is already reporting that the chancellor is going to implement an income protection scheme for the self employed and make an announcement within the next 24 hours i must say i got from the chancellors earlier reply a slightly longer timescale when he was talking about the end of april coming back to this point of reassurance can he mr sunak give us some real reassurance now to those anxious self employed people across the country that an announcement will be made very shortly outlining the capacity of hmrc and the dwp to deliver brand new schemes mr sunak responded what i can tell mr streeting is we would hope to have something to say very shortly in terms of something being implemented that will take longer he added in terms of saying what we are planning to do that can be something that hopefully we can do relatively shortly implementation will take a longer timeframe for the very clear delivery challenges that this scheme would pose very few of us alive thought we would ever hear a prime minister of the united kingdom with its centuries old liberties order us to stay in our homes and only venture out and never in groups to acquire what we need to stay alive or for basic essential exercise on pain if we disobey of being arrested and fined by the police his reason that wo n't have escaped you i hope is rarely in our history have we faced such a threat to the

obeyed his initial less binding instructions to avoid social contact so he is already hearing cries for help from london hospitals when we are still weeks away from the likely worst point of this crisis that dreadful cliche of politics we 're in this together is quite literally true we either respond as a mutually supporting community or we 're in deep trouble and yes apart from the inconvenience there will be a price to our prosperity it is now clear that the immediate reduction in our national income may well be greater even than anything experienced in the great depression in the us and germany there are respectable forecasts of their national income falling by between a quarter and half on an annualised basis in the coming months but failure to act decisively now would

personal protective equipment to nhs staff as frontline health workers face added pressures during the coronavirus pandemic pictures emerged over the weekend of people interacting in crowds and at close quarters mr hancock told itv news these people are delaying the solution to the outbreak i think its very selfish of people who ve chosen to interact socially with people that they do nt live with when the clear advice is not to do that he said you are helping to spread the virus and that costs lives its obviously damaging to the nhs and it ll mean that it ll take longer to deal with this crisis and everyone wants this to be sorted he also warned any young people who think that they re invincible that they are not even if they are fit and healthy the more that people flout the advice the longer this is going to take to get through and i want us as a country to get through this as quickly as possible the health secretary earlier admitted there have been challenges with the supply of personal protective equipment to the nhs after a doctors leader said they felt they were being treated like cannon fodder and felt like lambs to the slaughter amid reports that a number of medics are seriously ill after becoming infected with covid-19 including a nurse with no underlying health issues mr hancock said the armed forces were being drafted in to help distribute ppe supplies to the health service he told good morning britain deliveries were being made as he spoke mr hancock also told bbc breakfast the challenge is that obviously the amount they are using has shot up and we need to get the distribution to get to every hospital and making sure they have got those masks he said that a hotline has been set up so that medics can inform officials about where there are shortages there is a huge logistical operation on because of the nature and the scale of the nhs and the sheer quantity of masks that are rightly being used it is a massive effort and we want to know if you have nt got the protective equipment or are about to run out we want to hear from you as quickly as possible he spoke after the chair of the doctors association dr rinesh parmar said we have had doctors tell us they feel like lambs to the slaughter that they feel like cannon fodder gps tell us that they feel absolutely abandoned we are all pleading with boris johnson that they really look into arranging the vital personal protection equipment that all of us need on the nhs front line what our doctors are telling us is that although equipment is arriving some of it is inadequate some of it does nt meet the world health organisation guidance mr hancock also said that 12,000 ventilators are now available after last weeks appeal by the pm up from 5,000 that the nhs had access to previously his comments came after a letter in the sunday times from almost 4,000 nhs workers called on the prime minister to protect the lives of the life savers and resolve the unacceptable shortage

social distancing meanwhile boris johnson is facing mounting pressure to order stricter measures after thousands of people ignored calls for social distancing to slow the coronavirus pandemic the prime minister said he will be thinking very very actively about what steps to take if people continue to gather in large numbers in defiance of calls to stay apart there was anger among mps at scenes over the weekend of crowds flocking to parks markets beaches and beauty spots speaking on monday the health secretary called people ignoring government advice by leaving their homes to socialise selfish and said they could be costing lives matt hancock said he would not rule out a full lockdown just as downing street also said boris johnson would not hesitate to take further action if stricter measures were needed to enforce social distancing defying social distancing advice is selfish and could cost lives says health secretary conservative former cabinet minister julian smith said

18-year old was thought to have become the youngest victim of the virus in britain as the number of deaths in the uk rose to 281 there are growing fears that britain is on a similar trajectory to italy scene of the worlds worst outbreak where the death toll passed 5,000 over the weekend the italian government was one of a number of european countries to announce new or extended restrictions with germany banning public gatherings of more than two people not from the same household mr johnson warned that the nhs could be overwhelmed in the same way as the italian healthcare system has been if the the spread of the virus in the uk is not curbed but at his daily no 10 press conference on sunday mr johnson indicated he was reluctant to ban people from going outside for a walk or to exercise because of the physical and mental health benefits as long as they acted responsibly the government later issued updated guidance making clear that essential travel did not include visits to second homes camp sites caravan parks or similar whether for isolation purposes or holidays however among some mps there was a clear mood for firmer action amid fears that further delay would cost lives seven stories from the past week to make you smile amid the coronavirus outbreak snowdonia records busiest ever day amid social distancing coronavirus itv shows suspend filming over covid-19 concerns mr smith the former northern ireland secretary said many people have recklessly ignored government advice this weekend i will support any measure the government needs to force people to follow the guidelines designed to protect nhs staff and uk citizens lives for labour mr ashworth said we urge the government to make immediate preparations for the next stage and learn lessons from other european nations if voluntary social distancing measures are not adhered to the government must bring forward their plans for stronger action labour mp rosena allin khan who also works as an a&e doctor at st georges hospital in south london also bitterly attacked the governments approach she said her latest shift had been a deeply deeply eye opening experience with previously fit and healthy people in their 30s and 40s attached to machines fighting for their lives the prime minister has been blase about this from the start waiting for others to make decisions so he does nt have to it is costing lives she said enough is enough the nhs can not cope and it wo nt be long before doctors have to choose between who lives and who dies while people were heading to open spaces there were signs that city and town centres were closing down with mcdonalds john lewis primark and timpson among the high street chains to announce they were closing their doors meanwhile letters are going out to 1.5 million people with underlying health conditions who are considered to be the most vulnerable to the coronavirus telling them to stay at home for the next 12 weeks the government said it would ensure those without families and friends to support them would continue to receive food and medicines with the military helping to organise deliveries schools across the country will be opening their gates only to the children of key workers considered essential to the running of the country with apparent confusion over how many will be admitted education secretary gavin williamson appealed to parents to keep their children at home unless their job is critical in the response to the coronavirus this will help to halt the spread of the virus protect the nhs and save lives he said we will be closely monitoring what is happening in schools and will ensure they get the support they need in the weeks and months ahead we are relying on courageous nhs staff to help us through this terrible covid-19 crisis so many would say we have a duty to listen to their concerns and anxieties and as you will be aware and as the chief executive of st george 's university hospital 's jac totterdell has made explicit lots of doctors and nurses do not feel that they are being given the appropriate protective clothing a leading consultant has explained the issue to me it is probably best if i just use the consultant 's own words all we get are little plastic aprons that do nt cover your arms or neck or back or lower legs and no facial protection yet patients are coughing all over you then you walk through the hospital covered in the bug which as we know can live for days on surfaces and we are therefore basically all super - spreaders pm warns accelerating virus could overwhelm nhs in mothers day warning gp slams ' lack of respect for frontline workers amid coronavirus shortages coronavirus private health sector to work with nhs to provide extra capacity there are related points made by this and other doctors those working with acute patients and in intensive care get so called level 1 or level 2 personal protective equipment or ppe which is removed as soon as a doctor or nurse leaves the patient and there are elaborate doffing techniques for both levels to remove the protective clothing to minimise risk of leaving fomites virus particles on the wearer 's body or clothes but other doctors and nurses who will see patients in hospital before they reach the acute and itu wards have only the plastic aprons and face mask the consultant again with level 2 ppe which is head to toe you should then be totally clean and with level 1 ppe that includes facial protection and a long sleeved floor length surgical gown you should be totally clean too robert peston pm says mass testing for coronavirus is now official policy but in our uk specific downgraded level 1 ppe your face may be covered in virus because patients are coughing on you and remember touching your face is one of the highest risk ways to spread virus plus half your body and clothes are covered in virus because all you 've been wearing is a skimpy plastic apron so now you are a super - spreader trailing bugs wherever you go from patient bed to bed into conversations with relatives and even importantly from the hospital outside into the world at large it 's completely insane all of which begs multiple questions why are n't those doctors nurses and other medical staff who are in contact with suspected covid-19 patients forced to change into scrubs when they get to the hospitals with those scrubs discarded for washing when they finish their shifts before leaving the hospital why are n't those medical staff at the least given a full facial visor and long sleeved surgical gown as per world health organisation guidelines the government are trying to pretend were all getting proper ppe but were not says a doctor and i 've heard that sentiment from many there may well be scientifically sensible answers to all these questions rather than that the nhs does n't have enough kit but many doctors tell me they have n't had those answers and they are deeply troubled surely they and all of us deserve to have their legitimate questions answered the government has been urged to provide more financial support to millions of self employed britons whose incomes have been hit due to coronavirus some mps have warned that chancellor rishi sunaks plan to pay up to 80 per cent of workers who faced being laid off does nothing to help freelancers contractors and the self employed former brexit secretary david davis said the economy could face a fatal seizure if they were not protected pubs bars restaurants and gyms in uk close as fight against coronavirus intensifies coronavirus why social distancing works us to lock down 70 million people in bid to stop coronavirus spread but treasury chief secretary stephen barclay said ministers were focusing on measures which could be rolled out quickly in order to keep the economy going experts warned that assessing the incomes of self employed people who are outside the paye system would be difficult and would take time to work out shadow environment secretary luke pollard urged the government to increase statutory sick pay and give more support for the five million self employed in the uk he told itv news there needs to be support in particular for the five million people who are self employed in our country so lots of progress made but much more to be done trade unions and employers organisations broadly welcomed mr sunak announcement on friday that the state would pay up to 80 per cent of the wages of employees up to 2,500 a month if firms agreed to keep them on however mr davis said it was vital that the chancellor found a way of extending that support to the self employed mr davis told the bbc it is great for those who have got jobs but it does miss out a pretty important sector of the economy namely the self employed and he mr sunak is going to have to find a way of replicating this for the self employed as well chancellor rishi sunak lays out government 's package to help businesses closed by coronavirus mr davis call was back by tuc general secretary frances ogrady who said the trade union movement would be pushing really hard on the issue labour shadow chancellor john mcdonnell said we must urge him to shift once more to protect the wages of the self employed by including them in the jobs retention scheme and to raise the level of sick pay to the real living wage mr barclay admitted it would be operationally difficult to provide support to the self employed he said they were being helped through measures such as the deferral of self assessment tax requirements payment holidays for mortgage payers and the strengthening of the welfare safety net mr barclay said the main thing we have done is twofold it is to support the economy as a whole because the best thing for people who are self employed as for all people is to sustain the economy and ensure that we can return with those viable businesses and alongside that strengthen the safety net so we have increased the allowance on universal credit we have made it available from day one we have removed the minimum income floor so if people who are self employed are working less than 35 hours in a week they are not penalised within the benefits system the institute for fiscal studies think tank predicted that the chancellor would come forward with additional measures to help the self employed paul johnson director of the ifs said this clearly is a gap he is not able at the moment to replace the normal wages or incomes of the self employed i am sure that the reason he has nt done that is because it is a much more complicated thing to achieve i think it is right that he does nt try to do that too quickly coronavirus everything you need to know check the number of cases in your area

self employment hmrc will contact those eligible with guidance on how to apply for the scheme the scheme will cover the three months to may and the chancellor has said 95 per cent of all self employed workers will be covered by the scheme which is expected to be up and running by june grants will be paid in a single lump sum instalment covering all three months and will start to be paid at the beginning of june what should freelancers and the self employed do before june before grant payments are made the self employed will still be able to access other available government support for those affected by coronavirus including an extended universal credit service and business continuity loans where they have a business bank account the minimum income floor for universal credit is to be suspended meaning all those who are self employed can access universal credit at the rate equivalent to statutory sick pay for employees currently 94.25 a week also the self employed will not have to make any further payments on their self assessment tax return until 2021 universal credit and tax credit boost the standard universal credit allowance and the working tax credit basic allowance are both being increased by 1,000 a year new claimants wo n't need to prove gainful self employment if they are self employed and applying for universal credit claimants who have covid-19 or are self

reasons what matters is that the bank had better be right that the economy and businesses will bounce back when we are through this # covid19 crisis or the losses for banks and by extension for us

teachers and public transport workers chancellor set to unveil fresh emergency package to help workers through coronavirus outbreak california is in lockdown over coronavirus with 40 million ordered

then your children will be prioritised for education provision it added that children with at least one parent or carer identified as critical workers by the government could send their children to

hancock warned that coronavirus will continue to spread if people continue to socialise he said if you stay at home you are saving lives i know of course this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively some young people get it too he added so we 're urging people to follow the public health advice in the emergency bill that 's in front of parliament right now we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures so we can make it happen by law if we need to i 'd rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice are doing what is sensible and right the list has been separated into eight categories including health and social care key public services such as those essential to the running of the justice system religious staff charities and journalists and transport those involved in food production processing distribution sale and delivery are also included along with administrative occupations

williamson said the government would work with schools colleges and englands exams regulator ofqual to ensure children get the qualifications they need school leaders have said they expect that grades will be based on teacher assessment and evidence of internal assessment such as mock exams which could then be submitted to the exam boards to check paul whiteman general secretary of naht which represents leaders in the majority of schools said the government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be and their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers for the vast majority of children and young people school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort for the minority of key workers who have no alternative school leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice we will continue to work with the government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible coronavirus everything you need to

10,0000 to 25,000 to 250,000 and the endorsement from the government 's chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance that this could theoretically happen in weeks was the most important covid-19 announcement on thursday many in the nhs and in the wider scientific community see this as a shift in policy that should have come earlier but few doubt its importance in saving lives by making social distancing more effective because more accurately targeted and it creates possibility of an earlier return to something for all of us that would feel a bit more like normal life ps equally important is even stronger optimism on thursday than on wednesday from the chief scientist that a workable serological test is in reach and which would give strong evidence of who has had the illness even without symptoms and who therefore has the antibodies that should deliver immunity on my show last night sir mark walport the uk research and innovation chief executive said mass serological testing could happen in months and again this gives hope that the severe restrictions on our freedoms we are experiencing would have an end pps history will be the judge but those intimately involved in

confident that with a collective effort in social distancing britain will be able to slow the spread of deadly covid-19 he made the announcement in his daily coronavirus press conference however unlike on other occasions there was no talk of the government implementing any major new measures this time it seems he wanted to use the press conference to reveal more encouraging news about the virus he said scientists in the uk expect to start trials for the first covid-19 vaccine within a month itv news political editor robert peston says that the next phase of the government 's measures to combat covid-19 will be the closure of pubs restaurants and non - essential shops he also said the health service was getting better at testing and would soon ramp daily testing from 5,000 a day to 10,000 to 25,000 and then up at 250,000 he added to give you an idea of what is coming down the track we 're in negotiations today to buy a so called antibody test as simple as a pregnancy test which can tell whether you have had the disease and it 's early days but if it works as its proponents claim then we will buy literally hundreds of thousands of these kits as soon as practicable because obviously it has the potential to be a total gamechanger however chief medical adviser professor chris whitty warned that antibody tests currently on the market may not be the right ones and that needs to be tested out itv news health editor emily morgan explains why the uk is being advised to stick to social distancing measures queen says nation is up to challenge of beating coronavirus downing street rules out london lockdown uk coronavirus death toll rises to 144 mr johnson said he was conscious of the huge public effort and thanked the public complying with government advice but urged them to continue i think looking at it all that we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks and i 'm absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing in this country but only if we all take the steps that we 've outlined that is vital that 's how we 're going to reduce the peak and once we 've achieved that and i think that we will if we take the steps i 've said then the scientific progress that we 've been making will really start coming into play he said the public was playing a crucial role by following advice which he says is saving literally thousands of lives the prime minister revealed another piece of good news in the press conference the first british patient had been put in a randomised trial for a treatment for coronavirus but prof whitty warned there will be a lag before the public 's efforts to stem the spread of covid-19 will result in a slowing of case numbers and said for now they will continue to go up coronavirus death toll in italy hits 3,405 and surpasses that of china listen to our podcast with information analysis and advice how to avoid fraudsters during covid-19 outbreak the prime minister also stressed that london is under pressure due to a higher number of coronavirus cases than elsewhere in the country it is though the capital is around three weeks ahead of the rest of the country in the development of the virus mr johnson also warned this pressure is going to go up the first thing that will get under the greatest pressure will be intensive care and respiratory care system that 's the first point of real pressure on the nhs that 's going to be happen the pm said and to be clear even if everybody does all the things we hope and really really would ask that they will do the numbers will continue to go up over the next two weeks because there 's a lag until things start to improve he also urged employers not to sack their staff if they have taken a hit due to the virus spreading in the uk i say to

companies remaining to bounce back as well and it 's absolutely vital that everybody understands that now the prime minister said future downing street press conferences on the pandemic could be conducted remotely rather than by bringing journalists into no 10 we may have to find some way of getting them done in a way that does n't look to everybody else as though we are not following the advice that we give the public he said i know that you are all sitting a long way away from each other but it may be that we need to do more social distancing video report by itv news correspondent juliet bremner boris johnson has said nothing is ruled out if londoners disobey social distancing advice from the government and said he is ready to do more to ensure people avoid gatherings he told his daily coronavirus press conference there was some evidence that in certain parts of london people were not following advice quite the way we need them to do if we feel that social distancing advice is n't working and we need to bring forward tougher measure nothing is ruled out he said but he said there was no prospect of public transport in the capital city being stopped to slow the spread of covid-19 he acknowledged there had been some misunderstanding over the government 's plans but said people should avoid gatherings where they transmit the disease he added we are going to want people to avoid gatherings where they transmit the disease if it becomes necessary to do more to ensure that we will certainly do so his comments came after talks with london mayor sadiq khan who on thursday morning closed 40 tube stations due to lack of demand the move fuelled speculation that london was about to be put on lockdown but mr johnson 's official spokesperson rubbished those rumours telling reporters there was no prospect of it he dismissed suggestions of a travel ban telling reporters there are no plans to close down the transport network in london and there is zero prospect of any restrictions being placed on travelling in and out of london mr khan who earlier took the decision to close dozens of tube stations said despite the uk being clearly still in the early phase of this crisis the capital is at a more advanced stage social distancing in supermarkets ruled out as counterproductive london underground to partially close amid coronavirus pandemic military on standby to form coronavirus support force emergency bill to be published ahead of uk school closures he told the london assembly the fast developing situation means further measures will need to be introduced at the point at which they will have the biggest effect i can assure londoners that this is under constant review by the experts he added rumours of a shut down in london were first sparked by scotland first minister nicola sturgeon who has been receiving cobra emergency briefings she said more stringent measures could be introduced earlier in london because it is ahead on the infection curve when asked how far the uk was from a complete lockdown she said we know london is ahead of the rest of us the prime minister later did not rule out following similar moves by other nations in shutting down the city and stressed he will not hesitate in imposing further and faster measures pharmacies urge people not to stockpile medicines doctor asks why gamble with our lives amid calls for virus tests transport services slashed as demand collapses across uk he said he was reluctant to issue edicts restricting lives and implored people to follow the advice to socially distance themselves to slow the spread of covid-19 but let 's be absolutely in no doubt that these are very very important choices that we are now making in our daily lives the pm told his daily coronavirus press conference on wednesday specifically referencing shutting down london he added we do not rule out because it would be quite wrong to do so taking further and faster measures in due course london mayor mr khan warned people should not be travelling by any means unless they really really have to londoners should be avoiding social interaction unless absolutely necessary and that means they should be avoiding using the transport network unless absolutely necessary he urged londoners to play their part in preventing the spread of the virus by avoiding social interaction mr khan said we are in the midst of an immensely challenging and anxious time for all londoners coronavirus everything you need to know check the number of cases in your area with our interactive map listen and subscribe to our podcast coronavirus what you need to know your work travel and childcare rights how to protect yourself against the virus the most googled questions answered how to self isolate the new sick pay rules we are all rightly worried about our most vulnerable family members friends and neighbours but london has been through tough times before and throughout our city 's history we have repeatedly demonstrated the power of coming together in common cause now is the time for us to do so again because we all have a part to play in preventing the spread of the virus and helping to save lives mr khan also suggested transport in the capital could be scaled back even further to help contain covid-19 aside from station closures the waterloo and city line and night tube services will not run from friday but restrictions could go much further the mayor said i want to be clear now that the frequency of services is likely to continue to reduce potentially very significantly over the days and weeks ahead we will do this in a way that makes sure essential workers can still get around and we will not reduce service levels so that the remaining trains and buses are crowded the environment secretary has said social distancing in supermarkets would be counterproductive despite concern they are undoubtedly adding to the spread of the coronavirus george eustice who was answering questions in the commons about his department 's response to covid-19 said the enforcement of social distancing in supermarkets would result in people being huddled together outside it comes after several national supermarket chains introduced measures to prioritise older and more vulnerable people in order to make sure they can get supplies they need the measures which included two item caps on certain products and allocated shopping times for the elderly were imposed in reaction to panic buying and stockpiling which resulted in empty shelves another consequence was overcrowded supermarkets leading many to worry about the possibility of the virus spreading more easily but mr eustice ruled out imposing social distancing measures inside stores citing evidence from italy the epicentre of europe 's outbreak the good deeds making coping with coronavirus pandemic a little easier he said measures taken in italy had proven to be counterproductive as they led to hundreds of people huddled together at store entrances his remarks came after ministers were accused of lacking urgency in their response to the spread of covid-19 speaking in the commons labour sefton central mp bill esterson warned supermarket queues are undoubtedly adding to the spread of the coronavirus not least because of a lack of social distancing he added people need to see a much greater sense of urgency this needs to be tackled to prevent the spread within supermarkets will he today with cabinet colleagues implement and enforce social distancing in supermarkets to reduce the spread in that part of society mr eustice replied in the commons we will not do that measure "it was something that was done in italy with a restriction on the number of people in stores and what they found was they just had hundreds of people huddled together at the entrance to the store and it 's counterproductive emergency bill to be published ahead of uk school closures what schools closures mean for parents and their children coronavirus epicentre in china reports no new covid-19 cases shadow local government minister jim mcmahon earlier called for supermarket workers to be classed as key workers so their children can still attend schools he said our supermarket workers have shown themselves to be the heroes of retail making sure that people get fed and get the food that they need but there are real concerns about whether they can maintain that service if they 're not included in the list of key workers of course many will have children who will need care that the school ca n't accommodate can we have an assurance today that our retail workers will be on the list of key workers mr eustice responded the prime minister made reference yesterday to the importance of those working in the food retail sector in particular later today the government will be announcing those jobs defined as key workers but i can assure him we fully recognise that over 25 % of staff generally working in the food supply chain have children of school age that 's recognised and something that will be reflected when that list is published emergency legislation giving ministers greater powers to deal with the covid-19 crisis will be rushed through the commons on monday the coronavirus bill totalling 329 pages enables action to increase the available health and social care workforce ease the burden on frontline staff slow the spread of the virus manage the deceased with respect and support people through the crisis commons leader jacob rees mogg told mps that all stages of the bill would be considered by members on monday before it progresses to the lords later in the week the legislation published on thursday set out powers for the police to detain people suspected of having coronavirus and send them for testing people who fail to do so could be fined up to 1,000 other measures include powers for ministers to write to an operator of a port requiring their operation be suspended and for events or gatherings to be cancelled food suppliers would also have to provide information to the appropriate authority if all or part of a food supply chain is being disrupted or is at risk of disruption the legislation which is time limited for two years also modifies current laws to enable coroners to conduct an inquest without a jury for anyone whose death was caused by covid-19 local authorities will also be given the power to decide what happens to dead bodies and their disposal to ensure excess deaths do not overwhelm the system and funeral directors acting on behalf of a family will be able to register a person 's death coronavirus school closures dominate today 's front pages london underground to partially close amid coronavirus pandemic what schools closures mean for parents and their children uk schools will close to all pupils except vulnerable children and those of key workers in a bid to halt the diseases spread schools in england wales and scotland will close from friday and northern ireland schools will close from monday gcses and a levels in both england and wales will be cancelled although the prime minister said there are plans for students to receive qualifications a decision on whether exams will sit in scotland has not yet been taken and in northern ireland it is expected pupils will not sit summer exams education secretary gavin williamson told itv news this is a decision no education secretary would want to make in terms of closing schools and scrapping all the exams but it was something we had to do following the scientific and medical advice as by doing this it is another weapon in our battle in terms of stopping the spread of coronavirus he added that schools will only reopen when the scientific and medical advice says having schools open is not going to have any effect on spreading the pandemic we 've got to be realistic that this is something that is going to be just for a few weeks that 's why we had to make a decision to scrap the exam process mr williamson said while we 'd like to see schools opening at the earliest possible opportunity we equally have to be realistic that this may well take us to the summer term universities have called for clarity on the implications of cancelling exams with alistair jarvis chief executive of universities uk saying students should not lose out on the opportunity to go on to university this year because of the challenges posed by the pandemic we are committed to working closely with the government ucas examination regulators and school leaders on the practical implications of this and hope there will be clarity on this for students parents teachers and university admissions staff as soon as possible analysis from edge health suggested the nhs will face substantial pressures on critical care beds as the outbreak continues according to their modelling there will be a shortfall of 2,900 beds in the midlands at peak covid-19 ventilator demand while the south west has the fewest critical care beds and will need a 600 % increase or 1,900 to meet demand the number of mps affected by coronavirus is growing almost daily but parliament is still defying calls to close despite one of the prime minister 's top medical advisers saying there 's a lot of covid-19 in wesminster for prime minister 's questions only mps who have been selected to speak will be admitted to the chamber reducing the number of people inside from hundreds to dozens a message from the tory deputy chief whip stuart andrew sent to mps said in order to ensure that we follow the advice being given to the public it has been decided that only people on the order paper should be in the chamber labour gave its mps the same instructions and also asked those in the chamber to space yourselves out at pmqs

whittome and prominent brexiter andrew bridgen boris johnson has promised to protect private renters from eviction due to the coronavirus outbreak as he said the government was continuing with unprecedented steps at pmqs prime minister was urged by labour leader jeremy corbyn to impose measures protecting renters after he said homeowners impacted by coronavirus would be offered a three month mortgage holiday mr corbyn said yesterday the chancellor unfortunately offered nothing to the 20 million people living in rented homes including three million households with children they 're worried they 're worried sick that they ca n't pay their rent if they get ill lose pay or feel they need to self isolate it is in the interests of public health of the health of all of us that people do n't feel forced to go to work in order to avoid eviction when they know themselves they may be spreading this terrible disease so will the prime minister now confirm that the government 's emergency legislation will protect private renters from eviction mr johnson replied i can indeed confirm that we will be bringing forward legislation to protect private renters from eviction that is one thing we will do but it is also important as we legislate that we do not simply pass on the problem so we 'll also be taking steps to protect other actors in the economy mr johnson was facing questions in an unusually sparse house of commons as only mps who have been selected to speak were admitted mr corbyn also questioned mr johnson on the amount of personal protective equipment ppe issued to nhs staff for when they are treating patients with covid-19 there have been reports of regional problems with supply of equipment with some staff saying there are not enough face masks to go round mr corbyn also said measures to ramp up testing in the uk were not enough he said the world health organisation said test test test and we should be testing i believe on an industrial scale he said 10,000 tests per day is nowhere near even the number of people working in the nhs and the care sector adding it is a massive undertaking and i wish there was a greater sense of urgency from the government in getting this testing available for all staff emergency coronavirus bill to give government new powers to arrest and isolate people criminal trials be delayed in efforts to tackle spread of covid-19 mr johnson said the nhs was now moving to carrying out 25,000 coronavirus tests per day a new announcement he added there is a massive effort going on comparable to the effort to build enough ventilators to ensure that we have adequate supplies of ppe equipment not just now but throughout the outbreak mr johnson and chancellor rishi sunak said on tuesday they would do whatever it takes to help the uk economy as the number of people in the uk thought to have covid-19 rose to 55,000 and death toll reached 71 however the government has come under fire for not outlining provisions which would help home renters after providing a three month mortgage holiday to homeowners business secretary alok sharma told itv news the government was looking very closely at providing support for renters and said the housing secretary would soon set out new measures there are millions of people across our country who rent some of them will have anxiety about what would happen if they do indeed start to suffer from covid-19 satellite images capture impact of coronavirus from space the chancellor was very clear yesterday in the house is that we are looking very actively at this the housing secretary will be coming forward very shortly setting out the measures to protect renters measures unveiled by mr sunak included 330bn of government backed loans equivalent to 15 per cent of gdp and a package of tax cuts and grants worth more than 20bn warning that never in peacetime had the uk faced an economic fight like this one he also announced plans for three month mortgage holidays for homeowners suffering outbreak related difficulties business secretary sharma told itv news political reporter shehab khan the mortgage holidays would be offered to those directly or indirectly affected by the virus to give an example if you are in isolation as part of a household clearly that is an area that you would expect mortgage companies to look at the coronavirus package comes after the public was told to avoid all non - essential contact and travel while the elderly and those with underlying conditions were told they would have to stay home labour leader jeremy corbyn urged the government on tuesday to go further in its financial assistance by suspending home rental fees and ban evictions of tenants during the coronavirus crisis business secretary alok sharma said the government was working on measures to support people in employment and to help renters after announcing a three month holiday for mortgage payers he said of course people want us to go further the chancellor set out very clearly that we will be coming forward when it comes to employment measures we will come forward with that as quickly as possible he added we will continue to provide support where it is needed the prime minister has been clear that we will do whatever it takes to protect people 's health to protect people 's livelihoods we had a significant intervention yesterday we are ready to do more the prime minister warned that covid-19 is so dangerous that without drastic action it would overwhelm the nhs and that more extreme measures may be needed to protect lives in the

20,000 as he told of the huge amount of strain the health service will be under from covid-19 in a hearing of the commons health select committee sir patrick was asked whether the expected death rate was one fatality for every 1,000 cases which would mean that there are potentially 55,000 cases at present he said we ve tried to get a handle on that in sage scientific advisory group for emergencies and if you put all the modelling information together that s a reasonable ballpark way of looking at it its not more accurate than that nhs england chief executive sir simon stevens told mps the nhs would be flat out helping coronavirus patients for the next four to six months he has sent a letter to hospitals telling them to prepare for a large influx of patients requiring ventilation and

there was widespread anxiety and concern that the government was basing its measures to suppress spread of coronavirus on an assumption that the numbers infected were doubling every five days when the evidence here and internationally suggested doubling rate of nearer four days i raised this concern with neil ferguson the imperial college expert whose forecasting has underpinned the government 's accelerated moves to constrain our freedom of movement he told me i misspoke when i said five days his baseline for the spread rate r0 is that each sufferer would infect 2.4 people on average technically r0 = 2.4 which implies that the numbers infected would double every 4.3 days in line with the international data a&e doctor warns of carnage and chaos in hospitals amid covid-19 britons urged to avoid non - essential world travel for 30 days sick pay reimbursement among business support measures millions globally on lockdown as coronavirus pandemic worsens if r0 turns out to be 2.6 then the doubling rate would be less than 4 days and an r0 of 2.0 would mean doubling every 4.6 days the hope is that the doubling rate is nearer to five days than three but the important point is that the government 's preventative action plan is conditioned by expectation of doubling around every four days which believe it or not is reassuring because it suggests that if we do what the government is asking us to do in limiting our social interaction and it is by no means clear we will then the risk of the nhs collapsing under the weight of covid-19 has been significantly reduced video report by itv news health correspondent emily morgan an a&e doctor has told of carnage and chaos in the uk 's hospitals amid the coronavirus outbreak in a letter read out at the health select

latest evidence over the outbreak when asked about lowering the number of deaths from hundreds of thousands if strict measures are not take sir patrick said that is the hope that we can get it down to that and to put that into perspective every year in seasonal flu the number of deaths is thought to be about 8,000 excess deaths so if we can get this down into numbers of 20,000 and below that 's a good outcome in terms of where we would hope to get to with this outbreak but i mean it 's still horrible i mean that 's still an enormous amount of deaths and it 's still enormous pressure on the health service he added itv news health correspondent emily morgan gives insight into what nhs workers are saying about the situation coronavirus british nationals urged against non - essential international travel for 30 days millions on lockdown around the world as coronavirus pandemic worsens sir patrick also suggested there could be as many as 55,000 coronavirus cases already in the uk his comments comes as the number of people who have tested positive for covid-19 in the uk has reached 1,950 an increase of 407 in 24 hours mr hunt asked whether the expected death rate was one fatality for every 1,000 cases which would mean that there is potentially 55,000 cases asked if that felt right sir patrick said we 've tried to get a handle on that in sage the scientific advisory group for emergencies and if you put all the modelling information together that 's a reasonable ballpark way of looking at it sir patrick could not confirm whether there have been any young deaths but added the vast majority of deaths are elderly or have underlying health conditions he continued at the moment the uk has done around 44,000 tests that clearly is not going to be enough going forward he said the priority of testing would be patients in hospitals in intensive care units clustered outbreaks and referrals from gps he told the health select committee i think we need a big increase in testing and that is what i am pushing for really hard to make that happen what you do n't want is everyone coming to the hospital to get tested the quicker we come to a true community testing the better it will be when asked about why there has n't been any school closures and why the current policies are different from other countries sir patrick said school closing is lower down in the list it 's not that it does n't have any effects but it can also have complicated affects he added it 's a complicated one decisions will be made when they need to be made coronavirus

backed loans worth 330 billion will be made available to support the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic mr sunak said the unprecedented package equivalent to 15 % of gdp could go further if demand is greater and vowed to do whatever it takes to help the economy the chancellor confirmed during the second of the government 's daily briefings that he was extending the business rates holiday to all businesses in the hospitality sector and funding grants of up to 25,000 for smaller businesses with a rateable value less than 51,000 those in financial difficulty due to coronavirus will be offered a three month mortgage holiday he added other measures announced by the chancellor include reimbursing small and medium sized employers across the uk for up to two weeks statutory sick pay for each employee absent providing 2.2 billion funding for one off grants of 3,000 to around 700,000 small businesses in england a new temporary coronavirus business interruption loan scheme to support

unprecedented package of support for the economy during the coronavirus crisis and whether they go far enough the chancellor added this is not a time for ideology and orthodoxy this is a time to be bold a time for courage i want to reassure every british citizen this government will give you all the tools you need to get through this mr sunak described the outbreak as an emergency adding never in peacetime have we faced an economic fight like this one covid-19 is so dangerous that without drastic action it will overwhelm the nhs boris johnson added as he warned that more extreme measures may be needed to protect lives in the future in a bid to further support people mr sunak elaborated on plans to provide homeowners with a three month mortgage holiday if they are suffering difficulties due to the outbreak he said for those in difficulty due to coronavirus mortgage lenders will now offer a three month mortgage holiday so that people will not have to pay a penny towards their mortgage cost while they get back on their feet video report by itv news business and economics editor joel hills he said he will announce new measures to support people 's financial security in the coming days in the coming days i will go much further to support people 's financial security he told reporters in particular i will work with trade unions and business groups to urgently develop new forms of employment support to help protect people 's jobs and their incomes through this period asked if the uk is heading for a recession mr sunak said this will have a significant impact on our economy that 's what i said last week i stand by that but i also stand by what else i said is you know this will be temporary we will get through this and we will get through it together and the steps that we 're taking mean that we will emerge together on the other side able to rebound back to confidence and economic activity that 's why all the interventions we 're looking at are designed to provide that bridge through this what will be a very difficult challenging period but get us through this period and so that we can be there on the other side to emerge stronger thereafter boris johnson meanwhile said we only really have a few weeks to build the ventilators it is expected the nhs will need he added what i want what all business wants to explain what i 'm seeing is an end to suffering that is why they are working incredibly hard in the next few weeks and we only really have a few weeks to build literally thousands of ventilators that this country will need he added the british industry manufacturers are responding to this challenge with incredible energy and determination shadow chancellor john mcdonnell has said the government measures to support the economy through the coronavirus outbreak did not go far enough people are being laid off today and losing their incomes we are disappointed that this package does not address their concerns he said the further announcements laid out by the chancellor lack the certainty required amidst growing public anxiety and still do not go far enough in protecting workers renters and those who are losing their jobs or in fully supporting businesses at the scale necessary in particular the chancellor 's claim that new forms of employment support will be developed does not appreciate the urgency and gravity of the situation workers and businesses need to know now that they will be supported not in a few days ' time robert chote chairman of the obr told a treasury select committee hearing earlier on tuesday this is not the time to be squeamish about one off additions to public sector debt it 's more like a wartime situation that this is money well spent he added the priority is not to worry about dotting the is and crossing the ts of fiscal rules but to do what is necessary for the economy and the public the obr cautioned there would inevitably be some scarring on the country 's economy with a number of firms expected to go bust amid the crisis but it said the hit was expected to be large but temporary both to britain 's growth as well as the public finances peston how big and imaginative

the most googled questions answered how to self isolate the new sick pay rules a few principles should inform how the government any government responds to what is a devastating act of god that affects all of us they are 1 the vulnerable those who ca n't look after themselves need more help than most 2 if certain behaviours help to keep all of us safe they should be incentivised 3 if vital infrastructure and services are at risk of collapse and the market can not bear the cost of restoring them those costs should be socialised or shared between all of us with the wealthy shouldering the lion 's share here i am thinking of the genuine risks that if as the government has said a fifth of employees will end up self isolating and that may be an understatement maintaining everything from payment systems to broadband will become challenging i am not being alarmist business leaders have shared their fears with me about the risk of systemic collapse 4 the government and bank of england should be the insurer of last resort for companies which does not mean keeping all businesses on life support but does mean propping up those whose loss would do most harm to the uk 's productive potential and providing emergency cheap credit to others that can demonstrate their underlying viability and resilience new financial measures to help uk through coronavirus pandemic to be announced by government as one tory minister put it to me these principles imply that boris johnson will almost certainly have to oversee a government that for a good year or maybe longer will look quite socialist we 'll find ourselves implementing most of jeremy corbyn 's programme is how he put it as i mentioned the treasury and bank of england will find themselves having to play god in respect of deciding which businesses to save and the simplest way to make sure no one goes to work and spreads the virus when they should be self isolating is to introduce that most debated of modern welfare concepts the universal basic income which gives an entitlement to everyone to a minimum income even tories are talking to me about the probable need for a temporary universal basic income to get round all that confusion of which welfare payments kick in to whom and to save many younger people in particular falling through the existing state safety net right now what is required is decisiveness and simplicity in response and probably over coming months hundreds of millions of pounds in business grants new credit and additional welfare payments millions on lockdown around the world as coronavirus pandemic worsens when we hear from the chancellor rishi sunak later today i slightly doubt he will be ready to announce the full blooded introduction of corbynism even if his colleagues tell me that is our inescapable if perhaps temporary destiny but he is already aware that his budget of last week is a near irrelevance the economy is slowing fast a recession a global recession is unavoidable so tax revenues are already declining and welfare payments will be on a sharply rising path via what are known as the automatic stabilisers a deficit of anywhere between 6 % and 10 % does not feel remotely improbable in other words even if sunak did not tonight follow the lead of germany and france by offering significant state support running to many ten of billions of pounds to an ailing

and postponing exams schools have been asking for explanations as to why the uk is not following places like ireland italy new york city and los angeles where closures have all been enforced ahead of meeting mr williamson the chief executive officer of cst said it was seeking clarity on what to do about school closures adding how teachers are working in extremely challenging circumstances during a

curb nightlife to fight virus coronavirus vaccine trial set to start us government official reveals kate osborne is second mp diagnosed with coronavirus despite concern among leaders about open schools helping to spread the infection the government has repeatedly said closing them will not be effective the prime minister said on thursday closures now could do more harm than good hours after ireland announced schools and colleges would close for a fortnight published on monday new guidance suggests any pupil or staff member with a new continuous cough or a high temperature should stay home to avoid infecting others according to nhs england a high temperature is generally considered to be 38c or over if pupils become unwell at school they should be isolated while they wait for their parents to collect them ideally in a room behind a closed door with a window open it says if this is not possible then students should be moved to an area which is at least two metres away from other people while separate bathrooms should be used for any staff dealing with suspected cases of covid-19 the guidance says they do not need to go home unless they develop symptoms themselves but adds they should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds afterwards guidance states that in most cases school closures will not be needed but this will be a local decision based on factors such as establishment size and risk of further spread if there is urgent public health action to take the local public health england health protection team will contact the school and undertake a risk assessment it says phe will rarely advise a school to close but adds this may be necessary if there are so many staff being isolated that the school has operational issues regularly touched objects should be cleaned and disinfected more than usual using standard cleaning products while young children should be supervised to ensure they wash their hands for 20 seconds using soap and water the government says the guidance which covers childcare schools further and higher educational institutions may be further updated in line with the changing situation in a statement the department for education said today the education secretary met with organisations representing school leaders as part of ongoing engagement to ensure that the coronavirus outbreak has the least possible impact on childrens education and assure them that any actions taken will be based on the latest medical and scientific guidance the governments advice continues to be for all schools to remain open unless public health england instruct them otherwise in the letter written to the prime minister the national education union asked why the government is not closing schools in the same way as other countries particularly now plans are under way to ban mass gatherings the letter said we do not have the medical expertise to know what the transmissibility is between children and staff in close quarters in classrooms but your scientists will have made assumptions about that together with some view of the certainty of those figures it is very important that we understand what the increased rate of infection is for staff and parents if schools remain open including obviously for those with underlying health conditions themselves or for those they care for the letter from the unions joint general secretaries mary bousted and kevin courtney adds we know you ve expressed concerns about children not in school being cared for by vulnerable elderly grandparents or by nhs staff who would then not be available for work elderly could be quarantined for four months writes peston coronavirus how do i self isolate what is a cobra meeting and who attends the cabinet office briefing rooms however we would suggest that parents and schools would be able to work together to find solutions to that and we would like to know if you have any modelling of such societal responses leora cruddas ceo of cst ahead of the meeting with education secretary williamson said it is important to understand that all the big decisions about school closures exams and the suspension of inspections can only be made by the government she said these are not decisions that regulators can make independently csts top priorities in addition to seeking clarity on these big decisions will be about the arrangements for safeguarding and welfare of our children and young people and in particular the most vulnerable geoff barton general secretary of ascl said he would be raising the challenges of keeping schools open amid staff shortages and the potential for disruption during exam season with the education secretary he said we aim to work through these issues in order to arrive at constructive solutions about the way ahead school and college leaders are showing calm and assured leadership in these difficult times and we can reassure the public that everything that can be done to support young people will be done when the government announced that anyone with a cough or a temperature had to stay home for a week that was framed by the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser as a policy designed to slow the peak of the coming coronavirus epidemic and it should help to do that but there was another decision taken that many doctors tell me was more important and was in their view retrograde which was that anyone with mild symptoms who does not require hospitalisation would not be tested for it those with symptoms are not even being asked to voluntarily click on a button on a website or send in a text to announce that they may have the virus this means the government has little precise data on where the virus is and whether there are burgeoning hot spots that should be ring fenced and cut off from the rest of the country to delay its spread in other words there is in an inbuilt fatalism in the government 's policy which is that in the apparent view of the scientists and politicians there is no way to prevent the virus coursing through the population and that the most policy can hope to achieve is to lower the peaks of infection the former world health organisation director anthony costello has been eloquent in expressing the views of many that this is highly risky pm holds cobra meeting to mull stricter coronavirus measure kate osborne is second mp diagnosed with coronavirus his argument is that the only countries in the world that have significantly reduced the rate of increase of infection china singapore taiwan korea hong kong have done so by mass testing of potential sufferers and coerced isolation of those infected he repeatedly cites the who 's owns orthodoxy in praise of this approach so the question that i have repeatedly put to ministers and officials is why we have rejected this strategy and i have not had a compelling answer it is true that there is currently a laboratory capacity to do only 4000 tests per day according to public health england and an ambition to provide at least 10,000 a day given that officials believe there are probably more than 10,000 british people with the virus now significantly more than the official count of 1372 the labs would be swamped if everyone who thinks they have symptoms was tested and there is also a question about whether there are enough trained and available medical staff to carry out the swabs and process the tests but if there is a wartime mobilisation effort to massively expand the production of oxygen ventilators which there is why is n't there a similar expedited effort to dramatically expand testing why is the government being an activist in trying to buy life saving equipment to keep alive the acutely ill but being less of an activist in throwing money at resources that could significantly reduce the rate of infection the only answer we appear to have is that officials and ministers fear that if a chinese style plan to curb the outbreak actually worked it would be disaster postponed rather than prevented the fundamental fear of the pm and his advisers appears to be that if the outbreak is only modest in the coming few weeks it would rear its lethal head again next winter when the nhs would be less able to cope this is a message i 've had repeatedly communicated to me hence all the focus on the uk population acquiring so called herd immunity as i mentioned on thursday for all the health hecretary matt hancock 's rowing back on this yesterday but with a virus like this surely time is the most precious resource we have elderly could be quarantined for four months writes peston coronavirus how do i self isolate and if we can buy a few months grace from the most extreme of outbreaks would it be beyond the government 's capability to use those months to very significantly expand the nhs 's capacity and reorganise care so that it better meets these extreme needs though just possibly it is already too late even so i remain puzzled by the government 's approach not least because given how many british people probably already have the virus and given the current rate of spread which is probably a doubling in the number of cases every four days on the basis of european data we are set to run out of ventilators in a very short number of weeks which is why this week feels to me like perhaps the most important for the pm and his main advisers chris whitty and sir patrick vallance in their effort to minimise the impact of covid19 what they decide for example at today 's cobra meeting may have irreversible consequences for better or ill kate osborne has become the second mp to be diagnosed with coronavirus as a peer became the first in the house of lords to self isolate labour mp ms osborne tweeted she will continue to self isolate until i have fought off the illness but in the mean time i would encourage everyone to band together and support the most vulnerable in our communities the

the forced requisitioning of hotels and other buildings as temporary hospitals the requisitioning of private hospitals as emergency hospitals temporary closure of pubs bars and restaurants some time

perhaps a few weeks but with skeleton staff kept on to provide childcare for key workers in the nhs and police according to a senior government source the perception that ministers are reluctant to make difficult and costly decisions to battle the virus is wrong it is simply that the chief medical officer chris whitty and the chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance are waiting for the optimal time to force restrictions on our way of life that will be very painful they are deeply worried that some older people will simply die at home from neglect after they are quarantined so want to start the quarantine as late as possible some time within the next five to 20 days the prime minister boris johnson and health secretary matt hancock are counting on neighbours and friends to rally

about taking food to the old and vulnerable when they are put into forced isolation as i have written in previous notes all government efforts are based on the assumptions that there wo n't be a vaccine within a year and that everything has to be done to protect the collapse of the health service what keeps ministers and officials awake at night is the fear that if the epidemic becomes too great they would have to make appalling decisions such as that the nhs would stop treating people over a certain age such as 65 everything is aimed at making sure the nhs is not overwhelmed to save

next week and there could also be a move towards more people working from home a whitehall source said the announcement comes as the uk deals with a rising number of cases of the virus and a death toll of 11 a whitehall source said ministers are working with the chief scientific adviser and chief medical officer on our plan to stop various types of public event including mass gatherings beginning next week we are also talking to businesses and other bodies about the timing of moving towards much more widespread working from home there are many complex considerations to make all these

countries facing a us travel ban scores of major sporting and cultural events have already been suspended despite the government not announcing a ban on mass events in its latest guidance on thursday trump declares national emergency over coronavirus the important coronavirus fact the government does n't know london marathon premier league and efl events suspended i understand a bit more than i did about what the prime minister the chief medical officer chris whitty and the chief scientific adviser sir patrick vallance are trying to achieve with their covid-19 policy what that policy actually is what they actually know about the illness and importantly what they do n't know let 's start with the most important thing they do n't know this is the proportion of people who will get the virus but will show no symptoms it is a hugely important ratio because it conditions how far the government should take measures to restrict our ability to move around and socialise the point is that the more people who get the illness without showing any symptoms the fewer people will need hospitalisation which in turn means that the fewer actions the pm would need to take to curb our precious freedoms to be with who we want where we want and when we want coronavirus where you live in the uk check the number of cases in your area with our interactive map coronavirus latest your daily one minute update from itv news but the more people who would have symptoms when ill with the virus as a proportion of the population the more urgent it is to delay its spread because a massive surge of seriously sick people would overwhelm our healthcare system just to explain with notional numbers based on one statistic that whitty and vallance seem to have some confidence in namely that 5 % of those with symptoms will need hospitalisation on that basis if 30 m people got covid19 but half of those were asymptomatic with no symptoms then 750,000 of us would require help in a hospital during the epidemic 's duration but if the asymptomatic ratio were just 20 % then the coronavirus burden on the health service would be a near impossible 1.2 m newly sick people so as i hope you can now gather a massively important statistic is this ratio of asymptomatic sufferers to those showing any kind of symptom but whitty and co have little idea what it is and the problem is that there is no available serological test or test for the viral antibodies in our blood that would conclusively show who has had the virus whether or not they ever manifested symptoms huge amounts of work are going on to establish such a test but it almost certainly wo n't be ready in time to inform the decision of whitty vallance and johnson about how much so called social distancing staying away from people to enforce on all of us if you are with me so far let us now examine what whitty and johnson want to achieve with social distancing now i understand whitty has not been instructed by johnson or the health secretary to restrict his advice to policies that are affordable or do less damage to the economy that may happen at some point but so far whitty has given the advice he believes is best for our health and has encountered no push back which then brings us to his core ambition it is as far as possible to manage the rate of infection through the population so that it is not so rapid that the nhs ca n't cope at all such that far too many people die of the virus in a short time because the nhs ca n't cope but is not so slow that the ability of the nhs to help people with other illnesses and life threatening conditions is impaired for months and even years to put this in the grimmest possible terms whitty 's primary function is to minimise deaths from coronavirus though these deaths may not be directly from the virus itself but also from the inability to treat those who suffer strokes cancer heart attacks and so on calibrating all this is spectacularly hard not just because the government does not know the asymptomatic ratio but it also does n't know whether the virus will automatically calm down in summer only to rear up again next winter nor does it know whether those who suffer it are likely to acquire immunity for a short while or a long time for what it 's worth whitty 's central planning assumption is that this virus will have a spike in numbers soon and then come back probably less aggressively in the winter he makes another important assumption which is that the probability of there being an effective vaccine within 18 months is less than 50 % largely because no vaccination for any form of coronavirus has ever been made yet where is this leading the government given that the government has been widely criticised for not taking dramatic enough prophylactic action surprisingly it will i think lead whitty to pretty soon recommend measures that will feel severe and unkind namely that older people and those with chronic illness should be barred from any but essential physical contact with people which in crude terms means the elderly being prevented from mixing with their children grandchildren and younger friends why because the statistics are clear that the likely need for hospitalisation as result of catching covid-19 rises very sharply over the age of 70 coronavirus everything you need to know your daily one minute update from itv news check the number of cases in your area with our interactive map your work travel and childcare rights how to protect yourself against the virus the most googled questions answered how to self isolate the new sick pay rules now you may feel this is common sense but for those who are old and may in any case have not much longer to live it is miserable to be cut off from those they love in fact it is worse than that for some old and infirm ending contact for an extended period with their loved ones can lead to chronic depression and cause some to give up the will to live so the cost of this sort of social distancing would be big if in the view of many necessary as for other forms of social distancing i would be surprised if at some point there were not temporary closures of pubs and restaurants because whitty and vallance believe the risk of transmitting the virus is much greater in smaller social venues than in giant ones like stadia and at some point probably at the peak of the epidemic schools are likely be closed for a couple of weeks all of which is to make one simple and depressing caveat about johnson 's repeated statement and that of his health secretary that they are being guided always by the science which is that whitty and vallance would admit that what they do n't know about this virus is probably as significant as what they do know parliament will limit

earlier on friday the may 7 elections have been posted for a year because of the coronavirus outbreak the government said on friday that the prime minister has delayed the local mayoral and police and crime commission elections until may 2021 boris johnson made the decision over concerns that voters would be heading to polling stations during the height of the covid-19 outbreak both the electoral commission and the labour party had called on the pm to take action in delaying the votes a government spokeswoman said we will bring forward legislation to postpone local mayoral and police and crime commissioner elections until may next year we will also work with the devolved administrations to ensure that they have the necessary powers to do the same ministers had appeared to be pushing on with plans to hold the vote after the electoral commission polling watchdog recommended the delay chief executive bob posner called for a delay until the autumn in a letter to the government which was later backed by labour mr posner highlighted real risks over voter turnout and safety as well as candidates ' ability to campaign the pm 's move is the most significant delay to polling since then prime minister tony blair suspended the local and general elections in 2001 over the foot and mouth outbreak votes were due to be held in about 118 councils across england while londoners were to choose their mayor the association of electoral administrators which represents election chiefs had warned there may not be enough staff to keep all polling stations open due to sickness or self

how toprotect yourself against the virus the most googled questions answered how to self isolate the new sick pay rules video report by itv news political correspondent carl dinnen a public inquiry into a green energy scheme dubbed ' cash for ash ' which helped to bring down northern ireland 's government has ruled a multiplicity of errors and omissions not political corruption were to blame the inquiry made some criticism of current dup leader and first minister arlene fosters role in developing the ill fated renewable heat incentive rhi scheme and also highlighted unacceptable behaviour by several of her partys special advisers but the probe chaired by retired judge sir patrick coghlin said it would be wrong to blame specific individuals or groups for the design flaws that saw applicants perversely incentivised to burn excess heat to turn a profit who was involved in the introduction and running of the rhi scheme why has stormont been in a two year deadlock and what do the latest talks mean arlene foster defends special advisers at energy scheme inquiry he said responsibility should be shared among a wide range of people and public bodies the report was particularly critical of the stormont department in charge of the scheme the then named department for enterprise trade and investment deti corrupt or malicious activity on the part of officials ministers or special advisers was not the cause of what went wrong with the ni rhi scheme albeit the inquiry has identified some instances where behaviour was unacceptable stated the report rather the vast majority of what went wrong was due to an accumulation an compounding of error and omissions over time and a failure of attention on the part of all those involved in their differing roles to identify the existence significance or implications of those errors and omissions the inquiry panel said there had been insufficient steps to protect northern irelands budget and found important deti documents were inaccurate incomplete or misleading in important respects it also criticised civil servants for telling third parties about imminent cost curbing steps to third parties before they were otherwise publicly announced the rhi was established to encourage businesses in northern ireland to switch from burning fossil fuels to more sustainable sources in particular wood pellets but the fuel cost less than the subsidy which meant the more the claimant burned the more they earned the scheme which was set up by ms foster 's then enterprise department in 2012 threatened to overspend by millions of pounds a cost that would need to be recouped by the taxpayer ms foster has denied any wrongdoing and has said she did not ignore warnings from a whistleblower about the scheme in 2012 the resulting fallout over the handling of rhi between powersharing partners the dup and sinn fein contributed to the downfall of stormont the rhi scheme was overseen by former dup minister jonathan bell when it was eventually closed to new applicants after a spike in inquiries in 2016 northern ireland 's audit office predicted it could cost millions for stormont to make up a deficit in the public coffers owing to the potential overspend the inquiry noted that other public and private bodies quickly identified the flaws and lucrative incentive built into the scheme the inquiry said bodies such as invest ni and action renewables should have done more to alert deti but found no conspiracy of silence rather painted a picture of a silo culture between different parts of the public sector as i have repeatedly mentioned the view of the chief medical officer chris whitty which has shaped the governments response to covid-19 is that the virus is the equivalent of unstoppable bad flu but to make policy on that basis is to impose an epidemiological judgement on what is a social ethical and political issue the fact is that for most british people 20,000 people or so dying each year from flu is just one of those horrible facts of nature but that does not mean all or any of us will or should accept as a fait accompli that 100,000 or more have to die so that we can acquire the herd immunity i cited earlier on thursday as the governments goal how risky is boris johnsons ' maverick coronavirus strategy the evidence from around the world is that people will accept coercive social distancing painful restrictions on our precious freedoms to go where we want and when we want to save the lives of our loved ones and even if that were to cause the worst recession since the war most of us would give up any amount of money to protect those we love the evidence of south korea hong kong taiwan and singapore is that we are not powerless to slow and halt the spread and will pay almost whatever is necessary the response from whitty and johnson might well be that halting the virus in that way is not a cure that it would return with a vengeance as and when we leave our quarantines but at least we will have bought precious time to invest in better testing and treatments until that desperately needed vaccine arrives there is no question more important for all of us than whether boris johnson dominic cummings and matt hancock are right that there is no alternative to letting coronavirus run its course in the uk and to control the peak of the epidemic so that it falls in summer when the nhs may have the capacity to cope see my earlier note for more on their policy this may well be a rational approach supported by the chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser chris whitty and patrick vallance underpinned by some sophisticated modelling on how viruses spread through populations but rational is not the same as optimal workable practical or sensible conspicuously it is not the approach being taken by most other governments which are banning public events closing schools and even in italy most shops bars and restaurants it was striking that last night on my show when i asked margaret harris of the world health organisation to name a country that was adopting an optimal strategy she cited south korea which has a mass testing and quarantining programme that is on an utterly different scale from what prevails here i gave harris many opportunities to say something positive about the uks failure yet to impose serious restrictions on our freedom to move around and socialise she conspicuously failed to take that opportunity though equally she resisted the temptation to criticise trump suspends travel between us and europe amid coronavirus peston british government wants uk to acquire covid-19 ' herd immunity the worries for many doctors and medical experts about how we are handling the crisis are threefold first by simply making the assumption that the whole uk population should in a phased way be exposed to the virus to develop the antibodies and immunity we run the risk that the peak of the virus overwhelms the nhs whenever it comes it is within the governments own planning ranges for several hundred thousand sufferers to need in patient treatment over the course of a few very short weeks this terrifies doctors and if the modelling turns out to be wrong and the peak ca nt be managed so precisely as to fall in the summer rather then in winter then the hospitals would find themselves in even worse straits as would all of us also the rest of the world would see the uks attempt to acquire herd immunity as the scientists put it as massively antisocial in that it would turn the uk into a country sized breeding ground for the toxic covid-19 pathogens when they are still desperately trying to suppress the numbers getting it pandemic social distancing and delay phase what do they all mean what would the coronavirus delay phase mean for the uk trump 's european flights ban sparks anger and confusion how do i self isolate and what should i do if i live with others finally it is not utterly obvious that the kind of coercion we ve seen in china to confine the people of hubei to their homes to suppress the viral spread is as fatuous as our government believes the view of our ministers and scientists is that china is simply bottling up the virus and as soon as freedom of movement resumes it will restart its devastating advance through the population but that is not the whole story the longer the virus is contained the more the world can develop and expand treatment and care even if that will fall short of a vaccine for a good year or so none of which is to argue that johnson cummings hancock whitty and vallance are wrong but it does warrant a proper national debate coronavirus everything you need to know your daily one minute update from itv news check the number of cases in your area with our

sick pay rules chancellor rishi sunak has defended the huge 30 billion spending pledges laid out in his budget effectively saying the extra cash is reward for several years of austerity mr sunak who delivered the first post - brexit budget on wednesday said he was able to spend 18 billion in response to the coronavirus outbreak due to responsible management of the economy over the past several years the huge spending package which included a further 12 billion being spent elsewhere has been described as the biggest in 30 years and one that would not look out of place being delivered by labour the new chancellor said he was able to make the spending pledges because the country 's finances are now in a strong position and the foundations of our economy are good which means i can stand here and say that we will do what it takes to respond to coronavirus and he said he was prepared to spend much more on the nhs to try mitigate the impacts of covid-19 peston british government wants uk to acquire covid-19 ' herd immunity uk could face recession due to coronavirus disruption budget watchdog seven things we learned from the budget we will look and respond to the situation as it evolves but yesterday there was a very comprehensive package of support he said adding of course if we need to do more we will mr sunak who took over from former chancellor sajid javid when he quit after being asked to get rid of his aides said his budget was sticking to fiscal set out by his predecessor i 've delivered a budget within those rules which means we do n't borrow for day to day spending we borrow to invest for things like infrastructure rail road broadband and we that because it raises our long term productivity as a country it provides jobs it raises wages and that i think is the right economic plan he said his budget is estimated to add hundreds of millions of pounds to public borrowing by 2024 but he defended that saying the government will not borrow for day to day spending unusually labour 's john mcdonnell welcomed much of the spending pledges in the budget but said it had not gone far enough to protect workers against the impacts of coronavirus we 're supporting the government in terms of what they 've said about the nhs whatever the nhs needs it will get and we support that it 's a pity its taken a crisis to produce this but at least we 're there but he said his worry was over social care social care treats the elderly and they 're the most vulnerable group so we need investment in social care which is already in crisis remember the shadow chancellor said he said he was also concerned that low paid part time workers zero hour contract workers do n't seem to have access to statutory sick pay he said it means those workers could be forced to make a decision between health or hardship if they contract the coronavirus and need to be off work ministers are expected to decide on thursday if the uks coronavirus response should move into the delay phase after the global outbreak was declared a pandemic boris johnson will chair a cobra meeting where ministers are due to assess whether government action should shift out of the containment stage the delay phase is the second of a four fold plan against covid-19 and comes the day after the death toll in the uk rose to eight and the number of cases hit 460 the world health organisation has also categorised the outbreak as a pandemic so what does the delay phase entail the delay phase will see a mixture of the same advice given out such as encouraging the washing of hands regularly while also introducing social restriction measures to slow the spread of the virus the government has confirmed it will be guided by the experts about what the most effective measures for delaying the virus will be how will it help deal with the outbreak donald trump suspends all travel between us and continental europe amid coronavirus outbreak eighth person dies as who declares coronavirus outbreak a pandemic coronavirus what is the difference between an epidemic and a pandemic the end goal of the delay phase is to slow the rate of coronavirus being contracted and allow the nhs to clear the annual winter pressure it faces it would also provide a buffer to allow a possible vaccine to be found the governments planning document explained the benefits are that if the peak of the outbreak can be delayed until the warmer months we can reduce significantly the risk of overlapping with seasonal flu and other challenges societal or medical that the colder months bring the delay phase also buys time for the testing of drugs and initial development of vaccines and/or improved therapies or tests to help reduce the impact of the disease what do they mean by social restrictions according to the governments published action plan the restrictions being considered would have social costs these are thought to include urging employees to work from home where possible and even shutting down schools and cancelling events where masses of people will gather some of these will have social costs where the benefit of doing them to delay the peak will need to be considered against the social

china the severity of the interventions have differed on a country by country basis china and italy have put full scale lock downs in place with court action and fines threatened for people breaking imposed curfews wuhan the chinese city of 11 million people which was at the epicentre of the initial outbreak temporarily shut down its public transport network and in countries such as france and spain large public gatherings have been banned in a bid to prevent widespread contamination are sporting events at risk football matches in the european countries including paris saint germains champions league tie against borussia dortmund on wednesday have been played behind closed doors as a result of bans on gatherings of 1,000 people or more but there is doubt about whether the uk would follow suit after the deputy chief medical officer suggested scientific research did not back up the decision to outlaw public events dr jenny harries in a video exchange with the pm on wednesday said in general those sorts of events and big gatherings are not seen to be something which is going to have a big effect so we do nt want to disrupt peoples lives why is the uk not doing the same as italy mr johnson suggested the strict measures taken in other countries had come about because politicians and governments around the world are under a lot of pressure to be seen to act so they may do things that are not necessarily dictated by the science why are we still in the contain phase ministers have regularly stated that implementing tough social clampdowns too early can prove counterproductive as the public could tire of the restrictions but if as expected the pm and his advisers feel the time is right then they will escalate delay preparations current advice including washing hands and catching coughs and sneezes with tissues before binning them will continue during the delay period as will trying to find and isolate coronavirus cases at an early stage the key phrase we all need to understand is herd immunity which is what happens to a group of people or animals when they develop sufficient antibodies to be resistant to a disease the strategy of the british government in minimising the impact of covid-19 is to allow the virus to pass through the entire population so that we acquire herd immunity but at a much delayed speed so that those who suffer the most acute symptoms are able to receive the medical support they need and such that the health service is not overwhelmed and crushed by the sheer number of cases it has to treat at any one time the governments experts the chief medical officer and the chief scientific advisor have made two big judgements first as the world health organisation on wednesday in effect conceded that there is no way now of preventing the virus sweeping across africa asia and the americas which in practice means that it will be an ever present threat to the uk unless and until a mass vaccine is available for use second the kind of coercive measures employed by china in wuhan and hubei have simply locked the virus behind the closed doors of peoples homes and just as soon as the constraints on freedom of movement are lifted there the monstrous virus will rear its hideous face again donald trump suspends all travel between us and continental europe amid coronavirus outbreak what are the consequences for the uk of these judgements which the prime minister and health secretary are accepting we will know the detail later on thursday after the cobra meeting of ministers and experts make the formal decision to move from the phase of containing the virus to delaying the inevitable epidemic but we already know that at the heart of their plans are increasing the proportion of the population able to be tested and also what s known as social distancing in the first instance this will mean encouraging anyone showing even the mild symptoms such as a dry cough to self isolate at home but what it does not mean at least yet is school closures or the banning of mass events like football matches there are a few reasons why school closures are not regarded as sensible not least that children themselves are the least at risk from the virus although they may well be an important channel of infection transmission to older people who are at risk the four phases the government is using to halt coronavirus seven things we learned from the budget chancellor rishi sunak announces 30 billion budget boost to combat coronavirus threat however the governments main argument against closing schools is it would at a stroke massively deplete the manpower of hospitals and care homes because vast numbers of medical staff would be forced to stay home to look after their children and at the heart of the uks challenge as confirmed on wednesday in the budget with its extra 5 billion for the nhs as a down payment on the needed extra beds and relevant kit is how to make sure hospitals have the

ministers are looking with grim bemusement at the debate in footballs governing bodies about banning the public from stadia they fear this fuels alarmism and do not think playing matches behind closed

penchant for conspiracy theories and a deep scepticism in science and expertise america and the world desperately needed a leader he was missing in action last night video report by itv news washington correspondent robert moore president donald trump has announced he is suspending all travel between the united states and europe excluding the uk and ireland for 30 days starting on friday as he seeks to minimise the impact of coronavirus mr trump made the announcement in an oval office address to the nation blaming the european union for not acting quickly enough to address the outbreak of the virus and saying us clusters were seeded by european travellers we made a lifesaving move with early action on china mr trump said now we must take the same action with europe mr trump said the restrictions would not apply to the uk on thursday during a meeting with irish premier leo varadkar at the oval office president trump said one of the reasons the uk was not included in the travel ban was the strength of its borders schools in ireland to close until march 29 amid virus outbreak they do n't have very much infection at this point and hopefully they will keep it that way he said of the uk mr trump hoped the pandemic would work out well for everyone but added there was reason to briefly restrict some movement between parts of the world it is a world problem and we do need separation in terms of you have some areas that are very heavily infected and you have some areas that are not we do need separation for a little period of time the taoiseach said one of the reasons ireland was exempted from the ban was the presence of us border security in ireland at dublin airport i was through it myself yesterday they were asking the right questions mr varadkar is in america

including matt hancock and the prime minister had been tested for covid-19 mr barclay said they had n't chancellor rishi sunak announces 30 billion budget boost to combat coronavirus threat cobra to decide on moving to delay phase amid coronavirus outbreak mr barclay told peston its following the advice and what the guidance is and public health england are looking at who had contact with nadine

peston i think there s one big difference which we all should keep in the front of our minds back in 2008 we could see what the problem was with the fracture to the banking system the financial system we could see what we need to do to fix it and we did fix it was difficult it was politically difficult as well as being very expensive but the problem was there and it could be solved today the problem is quite different we are by no means clear as to the extent of the spread of this virus you can see in the figures that are coming out every day that it is still spreading and so unless and until the government is able to get control of what is happening and to assure people that is now under control that we are doing that things can move on when asked by peston about rishi sunak 's announcements on infrastructure spending in the budget he said let me tell you the easiest thing to do is to announce these things the really difficult bit is actually to deliver them he added now ill

in favour of jobs miracles but this was a serious speech for serious times unlike his predecessors mr sunak largely steered clear of jokes possibly because of the extraordinary circumstances in which he was delivering his budget but he could not resist a dig at shadow chancellor john mcdonnell claiming the left wingers economics for the many had sold so few copies it was his very own little read book sajid javid was left wondering what might have been his resignation on february 13 meant mr javid became the first chancellor since iain macleod who died shortly after taking office in 1970 not

beyond dealing with acm to make sure that all unsafe combustible cladding will be removed from every private and social residential building above 18 metres high mr sunak also said that the housing

cladding system was the principal reason for the flames profoundly shocking spread up the north kensington block in june 2017 chairman sir martin moore bick concluded that fire shot up the building at

five years of this parliament by just under 100bn to around half a trillion pounds the aim according to government sources is to boost uk public spending on roads rail broadband flood defences and so on from less than what is spent in competitor economies like the us and france to more than in those countries the plan is to allow public sector net investment to rise to 3 per cent of gdp or national income up from 2.2 % per cent according to the institute for fiscal studies the uk government has n't invested this much since 1978 though in the decades after the second world war this rate of investment spending was the norm all these new projects are part of the effort characterised by the prime minister as levelling up the poorer parts of the uk in the midlands north wales scotland

could be on par with financial crisis government fears but decisions on the budgets of individual departments will not be made till the comprehensive spending review expected in july sunak will also start an important public debate on the so called fiscal rules and how much the government can safely borrow the core question he wants addressed is whether low interest rates are now a permanent feature of the global economy and therefore whether the uk can securely increase its national indebtedness beyond the 80 to 90 per cent of gdp depending on how and who measures it that it is currently and that previous chancellor have seen as at the top end of what is prudent although sunak 's budget will set the framework for all investment and spending for boris johnson 's government which really matters the headlines may well be taken by the chancellor 's emergency measures to limit the economic impact of covid-19 he will announce proposals to protect the incomes of those who self quarantine and are unable to work and to provide support to businesses suffering temporary losses as a result of being unable to trade or suffering a sharp downturn in custom this budget will be the first of

the uk 's 5 g network after boris johnson survived a commons revolt over his decision to let the chinese tech firm help build the infrastructure senior tories sought guarantees from ministers over restrictions on huawei 's involvement including a timescale as to when high risk vendors would be removed from the system but the government defeated an amendment pushed by tory former leader sir iain duncan smith by 282 votes to 306 majority 24 sir iain 's proposal had sought to ban high risk vendors such as huawei from involvement in britain 's 5 g network after 2022 former tory leader sir iain had tabled the amendment citing security risks relating to the chinese firm but mr johnson 's huge commons majority of 80 meant the move was easily defeated the move was backed by several high profile tories including former cabinet ministers damian green and david davis the chair of the commons foreign affairs committee tom tugendhat and the chairman of the tory backbench 1922 committee sir graham brady how 5 g technology will help more than just communication in the uk johnson informs trump huawei will be involved in the uk 's 5 g network but with just 26 tories signing the amendment ahead of the vote the rebellion was never likely to succeed it would have taken 41 tory mps to defy the prime minister in order to defeat the government but those against huawei have indicated they 'll again try to block its involvement in uk infrastructure bob seely one of the tories who voted for the amendment wrote on twitter surprised by the significant cut in govt majority considering the bill was not even the right vehicle it was a strong first showing sir iain argued against allowing huawei to be involved with 5 g saying it would compromise the uk 's security.urprised by the significant cut in govt majority considering the bill was not even the right vehicle it was a strong first showing he acknowledged huawei 's cheap prices but claimed its links to the chinese state meant it could not be trusted the reality is that when it comes to security versus cost my view is security wins every single time because i worry when we start compromising security he added we have no friends out there anymore on this issue whether it 's the canadians the americans the australians the new zealanders they all disagree with us the commons debate follows prime minister johnson 's decision to allow huawei help build 5 g which was apparently met with fury by donald trump the us president reportedly blasted mr johnson with apoplectic rage during a heated phone call regarding the 5 g move the us claims allowing huawei into 5 g would compromise the uk 's security due to the tech firm 's links to the chinese state but a former chairman of bt warned excluding huawei from britain 's 5 g

will keep the 35 % market cap under review our intention is for this share to reduce as market diversification takes place we will work with the us and our partners to diversify the telecoms market and develop alternative suppliers i 've just been talking to a government official about how the market is being sounded out about the cost and availability of mobile morgues it is obvious this sort of contingency planning emergency procurement of industrial refrigeration in essence is sensible and necessary given reasonable worst case scenario estimates that additional deaths stemming from covid-19 would run to several hundred thousand the practicalities are grim chinese president visits wuhan for first time since city 's lockdown debi edward what 's it like living in china during the coronavirus outbreak uk ca n't rule out nationwide lockdown as sharp rise in coronavirus cases expected that said there is seemingly reassuring news out of china today in the disclosure that the daily rise in new covid-19 cases has fallen to a relatively small 19 even if the stats are n't rock solid they must approximate the truth given that president xi jinping has emerged from his self imposed purdah to celebrate them this stabilisation of infections at circa 80,000 in a population of 1.4 billion is on the face of it an extraordinary achievement and shows what can be done when the might of an all powerful centralised state takes action to restrict the freedom of movement of its people apart from anything else if the number of deaths at 3,000 is any sign of what draconian social distancing measures de facto 24 hour curfews can achieve then our new mobile morgues would remain unused phew but there is a big but what is unclear is whether the hubei wide policy of virtually imprisoning people in their homes has kept the virus at bay to such an extent that most of the population has not built up the antibodies and viral immunity this would be a mixed blessing because it would imply that when these chinese citizens are allowed to socialise once more the virus would proliferate again or to put it another way it is unclear whether xis victory against covid-19 is simply temporary for what it is worth our prime minister health secretary and scientific advisers are desperate to know the answer to this question because it will condition what they do next to keep us safe they and we wo n't know unless and until the chinese authorities conduct a thorough survey of hubeis people to find out how many of them have actually had the virus but so mildly or asympomatically that they have not been included in the official stats even if we give xi the benefit of the doubt and credit him with triumph there is both benign and hard news for us in the west it obviously means that the risks of infection from china to the rest of the world is diminishing but it begs very challenging questions for us about our cherished freedoms especially our right to go where we want when we want and to commune with whomever we choose as i said if china has held back the tide of this form of coronavirus it has done so by extreme coercion of citizens and turning hubei and its mega city wuhan into de facto prisons maybe we in the west would be prepared to similarly confine ourselves to barracks for weeks and months though i am dubious but if we are the relative economic cost for us would probably feel disproportionately greater because a lockdown of the uk similar to what is happening in italy would lead to massive earning losses for millions of people and severe difficulties for hundreds of thousands of businesses banks introduce measures to help customers affected by coronavirus all of which would probably feel worse in an economy like ours or italys which have been stagnating for years than in a china that is still growing in underlying terms at 4 % or 5 % per annum as i said on monday on news at ten the uncertainties around both the health and economic costs of covid-19 are on a scale beyond even the uncertainties around the parlous condition of our banks in 2007 that degree of uncertainty especially in mature economies is almost lethally cancerous which is

crime richard riakporhe who says he 'd been mixing with the wrong people when he was stabbed aged 15 told how a realisation following a life saving operation set him on the path to becoming the british cruiserweight title i sat down analysed my life analysed what i want to be in life analysed what i was doing and what i was involved in and i realised that if i was going to continue on this pathway it 's going to lead me to a certain destination i realised that i did n't want to live that life i do n't want to end up in prison i do n't want to end up dead he said now aged 30 he wants to help others in the same position and thinks his remarkable story might have given him some of the answers he told podcast host paul brand how one way to warn young people against knife crime would be to impose tougher punishments if you stabbed somebody and you would be sentenced to minimum 25 years i do n't think there would be a lot of stabbings because people would be thinking about their future he said but he believes interventions can be made before young people even think about carrying a weapon he says a lot of people involved in knife crime are on one path and they probably believe that there 's no way out some of these people the less fortunate that end up carrying knives and ending up in that gang culture they did n't have no parents they came from completely broken homes he added adults should be looking for social indicators in young people it 's all about looking in and when you do look in you find all the answers he says one of them he believes would be to work with certain influencers to dissuade young people from knife crime the younger generation are all over social media and they 're influenced by music and sports so getting a collaboration going with certain key figures in key areas i think that would be very effective he said he believes stop and search causes young people to despise the authorities so that probably wo n't be a good idea what would be a better idea is trying to find the route of the problem coming to communities trying to promote cohesion talk to the leaders the influencers it 's all about people coming together and just putting their brains together i do n't think it 's rocket science he added on a smaller scale mr riakporhe tries to tackle knife crime himself by talking to young people and sharing his story i

that the government is acting too slowly the prime minister said there 's no question that this is going to become a significant a much more significant outbreak than it currently is that 's obvious

could be worse than the 2007/8 financial crash professor chris whitty said what we are moving now to is a phase when we will be having to ask members of the general public to do different things than they would normally do but he stressed the importance of timing because anything we do we have got to be able to sustain throughout the peak of the outbreak there is a risk if we go too early people

answered how to self isolate the new sick pay rules words by itv news westminster multimedia producer lewis denison whenever there 's a crisis in the uk one thing that often swiftly follows is a cobra meeting for example one government response to the coronavirus outbreak in the uk is to hold more regular cobra meetings to the public a cobra meeting is generally when members of the government meet to discuss the response to a given issue that is largely the case however there is a little more detail than that why are they called cobra meetings despite sounding as though it 's named after a venomous breed of snake which would be an appropriate metaphor given the purpose of the meetings cobra is actually an acronym for a series of rooms in the cabinet office in 70 whitehall you 'll sometimes see it referred to as cobr which stands for cabinet office briefing room the a is believed to stand for briefing room a however it 's unclear whether that 's actually the case room f was the most commonly used when the meetings first began to take place pm chairs emergency virus meeting as uk cases reach 319 what is the best way to protect against coronavirus covid-19 what are your work travel and childcare rights while cobra does refer to that set of rooms in the cabinet office the term is shorthand for the civil contingencies committee which is the group of people who meet inside the rooms to discuss various issues when someone says cobra is meeting what they actually mean is members of the civil contingencies committee are convening in the cabinet office according to the institute for government the term was born when an emergency situation centre was developed for the government to review its response to the the 1972 miners strike who attends cobra meetings unlike a cabinet meeting where frontbenchers meet the prime minister there is no rigid register for who should attend a cobra meeting and not even boris johnson has to attend the composition of any cobra meeting depends on the issue that is to be discussed according to the institute for government it 's usually made up of officials and agency personnel alongside ministers from relevant departments and agencies for example as the government discusses its response to the coronavirus outbreak england 's chief medical officer chris whitty attends on the other hand following a terror attack mr whitty would not attend but perhaps the uk 's top police officer met commissioner cressida dick would the meetings are usually chaired by the most senior and most relevant minister in the room plus the prime minister so it 's likely that prime minister johnson and health secretary matt hancock are chairing coronavirus cobra meetings what does cobra do the purpose of a cobra meeting is to discuss high level coordination and decision making in the face of a crisis according to the institute for government the crisis could be a range of things including natural disasters terrorist attacks major industrial accidents and as coronavirus has demonstrated threats to public health chairing a cobra meeting is often a good way for a prime minister to demonstrate to the public how he or she has a grip on a situation but the relevant people will usually already have been making decisions well before a meeting is called according to the institute for government cobra 's purpose is to keep ministers appraised of the situation to ensure that the wider response of the government is coordinated to record and disseminate key decisions and updates to all relevant ministers and officials and to provide ministers and the prime minister with up to date information on the situation for any decisions that they may need to make a former head of the countrys equalities watchdog has been

traitor as he arrived in worcestershire to meet flood hit communities the prime minister has been criticised for failing to visit areas flooded by intense rainfall earlier some onlookers shouted traitor at mr johnson as he arrived on the banks of the river severn in bewdley on sunday afternoon one woman asked the pm are you about two weeks too late insurance payouts for storms dennis and ciara set to top 360 m flood warnings remain as uk emerges from wettest february on record flooded communities fearing the worst as storm jorge looms when mr johnson was asked why he did not visit flood hit communities when the waters were at their peak he responded it 's too easy for a pm to come to a place in a middle of an emergency it 's not so easy frankly for the emergency services what they have to do is then break off and gold command has to find somewhere to brief you everybody has to gather they 're diverting from their work for hours and hours what i 've been doing since the flooding began is coordinating the national response but also looking at what we can do in the next months and years to ensure this country really is ready to cope with the impacts of flooding bewdley has been among the worst hit areas in england following the wettest february on record parts of the uk were lashed with weeks of heavy rain starting with storm ciara and continuing with storm dennis and then storm jorge all contributing to record river levels mr johnson said he would get bewdley done as he spoke to residents affected by the floods he said he was so sorry to hear it when he heard homes had been overwhelmed by as much as 2 ft of water mr johnson received a mixed reception as he walked through bewdley town centre while a number of teenagers asked him to stop for a selfie on the bridge and he happily obliged with a smile and a thumbs up as he walked back on to the river bank one man shouted do your f job but other residents mobbed the prime minister and tried to shake his hand and take photos as he made his way along the river he met with members of the emergency services who responded when the water levels rose and told them the defence structures in the town were pretty amazing but the prime minister said he had discussed with environment agency officials what permanent defences can be installed he said what were doing is we are doubling the funding for flood defences to 5.2 billion and were also going to be looking at all the things we can do upstream mr johnson was also asked how flood hit communities can feel reassured because the barriers did breach he replied that the issue was that water had come over the top of them the problem with these barriers is that they were overtopped mr johnson said they are great bits of kit but when you have a big flood like that they 're not going to be effective the things we have to look at are the rules which currently say that you ca n't put in permanent defences when you 've only got a small number of households potentially affected the case we need to make is it 's not just the number of households it 's also the economic damage it 's the damage to confidence all the rest of it in the town the

there are policy levers we can take to ease the short term burden on businesses cashflow the 39-year old said the government would be able to help the country get through the outbreak of covid-19

outlining his plan to help businesses cope with the virus the mp for richmond yorkshire told the sunday telegraph you have to look at the nature of what the economic impact might be so that we can

that s where we might look at some targeted options to help ease the strain on cash flows for a certain period to help them get through to the other side obviously alongside the supply shock there will likely be an impact on demand if people are at home mr sunak also told the paper that he was looking at objections to transaction taxes such as stamp duty an apparent hint that the levy could be changed in future budgets and he said that he wanted lower rates of tax during his time in office hancock government will do everything in its power to delay coronavirus spread meanwhile the treasury said funding for flood defences is expected to be doubled to 5.2 billion in the forthcoming budget the investment will help to build 2,000 new flood and coastal defence schemes and better protect 336,000 properties in england over the next six years mr sunak said communities in britain have been hit hard by severe flooding this winter saying it is right that we invest to protect towns families and homes across the uk the funding which doubles the 2.6 billion spent on flood defences between 2015 and 2021 is expected to be targeted in every region and will be available from next april insurance payouts for storms dennis and ciara set to top 360 m mr sunak said this budget will be about delivering on our promises to the british people and levelling up all parts of the uk is a big part of that communities up and down britain have been hit hard by the floods this winter so it is right that we invest to protect towns families and homes across the uk the uk has been battered by a

is to be investigated by parliaments watchdog over his 15,000 winter break to the caribbean according to reports the prime minister and his partner carrie symonds accepted accommodation for a private break in st vincent and the grenadines as a post - election victory escape but confusion reigned after mr johnson declared in the register of mps interests that he had accepted accommodation for a private holiday for my partner and me value 15,000 citing businessman david ross as the provider a spokesman for mr ross then denied that the co - founder of the carphone warehouse had stumped up any money labour demands investigation into boris johnsons 15,000 holiday to mustique but the conservative party donors spokesman later clarified his stance agreeing it was a benefit in kind to the pm and ms symonds during their private break to the island of mustique the observer said the parliamentary commissioner for standards kathryn stone decided to pursue an official inquiry into mr johnson on wednesday and has requested information from the pm and mr ross it follows calls from labour for an inquiry into how the pm came to enjoy the free provision of a five figure villa boris johnson urged to fess up over mystery 15,000 holiday in a letter to the commissioner last month shadow cabinet office minister jon trickett said the code of conduct requires members to provide the name of the person or organisation that actually funded a donation the evidence now suggests it was not david ross the entry made by the prime minister therefore appears to be incorrect the trip provided mr johnson with a break after the election campaign which produced a conservative landslide for the first time since the 1980s but he faced criticism for failing to cut the festive holiday short when international tensions rose after the us killed iranian general qassem soleimani on january 3 the commissioner would investigate whether mr johnson has broken the mps code of conduct and forward any findings onto the committee on standards which would review the evidence and if appropriate recommend a penalty mr johnson and ms symonds announced last week that they became engaged at the end of 2019 and are expecting a baby early this summer six raf fighter jets were scrambled to intercept russian aircraft on saturday after they tried to enter british airspace the ministry of defence has said the unidentified aircraft were tracked heading towards the north west coast of scotland prompting the air force to deploy three pairs of typhoons from its quick reaction alert programme two pairs of typhoons were dispatched from raf lossiemouth close to moray in north east scotland while the third flew from raf coningsby in lincolnshire flying in formation two pairs approached the aircraft before withdrawing while the third pair finished the job of forcing them to change course a voyager tanker the air to air refuelling aircraft from raf brize norton in oxfordshire was also deployed to support the mission the unidentified aircraft were later revealed to be tupolev tu-95 bears russian aircraft used both as strategic bombers and long range maritime patrol planes the total number of russian aircraft involved in the incident has not been revealed this was a routine response to russian aircraft approaching uk air space and was coordinated with several other nato allies and raf spokesman said raf lossiemouth tweeted at no point did these aircraft enter uk sovereign airspace the russian aircraft were shadowed by our typhoons along with quick reaction alert aircraft from our @nato partners in norway and france it added we are ready to respond to any unidentified aircraft and potential airborne threats 24/7/365 sonic boom caused by typhoon jets scrambled to aircraft in april last year typhoons from raf lossiemouth were scrambled twice in five days to prevent russian military planes entering uk airspace during the same period jets from raf coningsby were also

bereavement support has told itv news his children are being discriminated against because he and his partner were not married kevin simpson brought the case against the department for work and pensions in february over his family 's right to receive bereavement support payment a short term benefit only available to husbands wives and civil partners the high court ruled the law was against human rights law and discriminates against unmarried partners and their children however more than a month on from the ruling the dwp has yet to confirm whether or not it will accept it and change the law mr simpson a father of two whose partner debbie died in march 2018 has told itv news enough is enough and has urged the government to accept the court 's judgement an estimated 2,000 families each year are denied the bereavement support payment because the parents were not married the childhood bereavement network said the lack of financial support plunges families into financial hardship it 's very hurtful for families when they realise the difference that not being married has made in those circumstances so many parents would already have been treated as a couple for benefits but then are n't treated the same for bereavement says alison penny director of the childhood bereavement network in 2015 sam rudd 's long term partner alex percival died suddenly leaving behind three young sons ned noah and josh despite being together for 19 years sam was not entitled to any bereavement support because she and alex never married the mother of three was forced to cut back on her hours at work to care for boys and without any financial aid the family was eventually forced to sell their home i think it 's quite unfair because like i think the person that is married and the person that is not married need the same amount of help regarding what has happened to them says sam rudd 's son the bereavement support payment was introduced in 2017 and is worth up to 9,800 over a maximum period of 18 months in 2018 a supreme court ruling the current policy of denying cohabiting couples access to support was incompatible with human rights law after unmarried mother of four siobhan mclaughlin from northern ireland was denied widowed parents allowance the benefit replaced by bereavement support payment despite two court rulings the government has yet to make any changes to the law to bring it into line with human rights law in response the department for work and pensions told us losing a loved one is devastating and we are carefully considering the court judgments on cohabiting couples

at the close of the year cutting the price of a pack of 20 tampons by 7p and 5p on 12 pads from january 1 2021 eu law has so far prevented member states from reducing the rate below 5 % which means tampons and pads are treated as luxury items and not essentials critics have long argued the levy contributes to period poverty where sanitary products are pushed out of reach because of their cost in

groups and local communities across the uk have access to it three in 10 payments are still made using notes and coins but the closure of many bank branches and free to use atms has fuelled concerns

regulator around legislation immediately after the budget next wednesday handing watchdogs new powers to ensure banks continue to properly support their customers ' cash needs is one option under consideration the treasury also wants the banks to create a new system for moving money around the country so cash remains accessible for those who use it every day itv news political reporter shehab khan on the chancellor 's symbolic move to scrap the tampon tax the finance industry has set up various schemes to help fill gaps in cash access but many have argued that legislation is needed to protect the long term future of paper money atm network link has committed to replacing protected cash dispensers where there is no free machine or post office counter within one kilometre it also recently set up a request an atm service allowing communities to directly ask for a machine to be installed in their area the commitment to legislation builds on government efforts to protect cash including investing 2 billion since 2010 to ensure everyday banking services such as the ability to deposit and withdraw cash are available at the post office 's 11,500 branches across the uk consumer group which recently wrote to mr sunak calling for legislation that protects cash for as long as it is needed the letter read in the past two years 9,000 free cash machines and 1,200 bank branches

long term access to cash across the uk brc head of payments policy andrew cregan said earlier this week cash accounts for almost 40 % of retail transactions and is important to many vulnerable people especially as a tool for budgeting and control the uks human rights watchdog is under increasing pressure to investigate islamophobia in the conservative party after being handed a fresh dossier detailing allegations against more than 300 people the muslim council of britain mcb added claims about mps party members councillors and advisers to prime minister boris johnson in the document submitted on thursday the dossier sent to the equality and human rights commission ehrc also reiterates allegations of islamophobia against the prime minister mcb secretary general harun khan said the tories have a systemic and widespread islamophobia crisis and accused the party of denial dismissal and deceit itv news exclusive dossier exposes more than 100 accusations of islamophobia and racism from conservative party members he criticised the ehrc for having failed to give any response to its first formal call for the watchdog to investigate in may and urged it to take swift action tory peer baroness warsi a former chair of the party said islamophobia runs deep and wide in the conservatives and accused leaders of allowing it to fester but a conservative spokesperson insisted the party has a robust approach to discrimination of any kind and said it consistently takes decisive action to deal with incidents of hatred they have committed to an inquiry into all forms of discrimination within the party but have resisted calls to set up an independent inquiry into islamophobia specifically the mcb which represents mosques schools and charitable associations handed its first document to the ehrc in may detailing about 150 individuals it believes have displayed islamophobia or made anti - islam or anti - muslim comments but in renewing its calls for the ehrc to investigate it has submitted a document which has swelled to include double the number of claims mr khan said it was extraordinary that the watchdog has not announced whether it will take action in the 10 months since the first document was submitted significant spike in islamophobia after boris johnsons letterbox comments there is no doubt that the conservative party has an islamophobia crisis it is institutional systemic and widespread the partys response has been one of denial dismissal and deceit he said this results in clear discrimination against muslims because of their religion the absence of meaningful action by the conservative party despite the wealth of evidence makes it all the more important that the ehrc recognises the impact of this level of islamophobia in our governing party and takes swift action an ehrc spokesperson said the watchdog was still waiting for the tories to reveal the terms of its inquiry while considering a decision we are actively considering what if any action we may take in relation to the handling of islamophobia and other discrimination within the conservative party they said we are also awaiting the final terms of reference of the partys independent review which we will consider as part of our decision making process the submission contains allegations against 16 mps one mep nine election candidates and 183 party members among others according to the mcb sajid javid says broader probe into prejudice within tory ranks ' makes sense rather than just islamophobia and it includes the dehumanising and offensive remarks by the pm in which he likened muslim women who wear a veil to bank robbers and letter boxes during the general election campaign he apologised for all the hurt and offence that had been caused to the muslim community by islamophobia within the party the pm has insisted the party has a zero tolerance approach to islamophobia but the mcb said this does not appear to be the case a conservative spokesperson said the conservative party has a robust approach to discrimination of any kind and consistently takes decisive action to deal with any incidents of hatred abuse or intimidation we are holding an independent review which is looking at how we can improve our processes to make sure that any instances are isolated and that there are thorough processes in place to stamp them out as and when they occur elizabeth warren has dropped out of the democratic presidential race after a disappointing super tuesday result the exit comes just days after the one time frontrunner failed to win a single state in the super tuesday vote when millions vote in 16 states territories and groups accounting for almost one third of the total delegates available in the democratic nominating contest including her home state the senator confirmed she was dropping out the race in an address to media and supporters outside her home in massachusetts ms warren said she has spoken with bernie sanders and joe biden and is weighing up which man to back the two septuagenarians are the leading candidates in the race for the democratic nomination which now has only three contenders speaking to reporters outside her home ms warren said she would not decide who to endorse on thursday i need some space and i need a little time right now she said ms warren 's voice cracked when she talked about meeting so many little girls while campaigning around the country for the past year and knowing they are going to have to wait four more years at least to see a woman in the white house who are the democratic candidates seeking the partys presidential nomination super tuesday joe biden claims nine victories including texas at earlier stages in the race senator warren had appealed to progressives within the democratic party with her plan for everything and strong message of economic populism but her initial momentum failed to get results and the massachusetts senator became increasingly squeezed out by mr sanders who had an immovable base of voters she needed to advance the great recovery joe biden is americas 77-year old comeback kid ms warren 's exit from the race follows a series of other drops outs beginning in the days before the super tuesday vote with amy klobuchar and pete buttigieg and most recently billionaire mike bloomberg senator warren made headlines for her stinging attack on mr bloomberg a former new york mayor when the pair met for the democratic debate in las vegas elizabeth warren takes on mike bloomberg in the las vegas democratic debate the outlook for the remaining

actually do the government 's chief scientific adviser has said a vaccine for the coronavirus is likely to be more than a year away speaking on itv 's peston sir patrick vallance said a vaccine that can be used generally we 'd be very lucky to get one within a year sir patrick added that if a vaccine was found it would most likely be used to protect the most vulnerable first before being extended to others coronavirus latest your daily one minute update from itv news what is the strain of coronavirus known as covid-19 and what are the symptoms since the outbreak of the coronavirus in china at the end of last year the new viral pneumonia has spread worldwide with at least 70 countries reporting cases more than 93,000 people have now been infected across the globe while the uk saw a jump of more than 30 cases in just 24 hours on wednesday to bring the total number of coronavirus cases to 87 on wednesday officials in italy which has seen the largest outbreak of the virus in europe announced the closure of schools across the country until 15 march in a bid to control the spread speaking on itv 's peston scientific adviser to the prime minister sir patrick vallance said children experience a very very mild illness if they contract the coronavirus sir patrick who chairs the scientific advisory group said the new coronavirus posed no greater threat to children with asthma than any usual respiratory tract infection peston government to take draconian powers to limit virus spread coronavirus outbreak what are your work travel and childcare rights he said the a number of measures were being modelled in case the virus spreads more widely in the uk these are all measures which we 've modelled and we look at to see which is the most likely impact to have and at what stage you need to get these measures implemented and in what combination sir patrick added school closures is one of the things people look at it 's not the most obviously or necessarily the way in which you 'll get the most change health secretary matt hancock has previously said there are several weeks before the coronavirus outbreak in the uk could cause school closures though a number of schools have already taken measures to contain the potential spread by closing for deep cleans to take place or asking students to self isolate scotland 's first minister nicola sturgeon also speaking on itv 's peston said the closure of schools was not something her government would rule out in response to the coronavirus scotland has three confirmed coronavirus cases but ms sturgeon said she expected that number to rise significantly in the days to come coronavirus how do i self isolate and what should i do if i live with other people coronavirus outbreak what are your work travel and childcare rights with some of the coronavirus cases confirmed in britain already given the all clear sir patrick said you would expect individuals to build up an immunity to the new virus it 's much too early and we do n't have enough information from patients yet and we do n't have the right tests yet but you would expect with this virus as with other similar coronavirus and other similar infections that you would get an immunity and that most people would end up with some immunity that would last for some period questioned on how the the scientific advisory group for emergencies guides the government on health choices sir patrick said the economic impact of decisions was not considered by his department it comes after financial markets suffered in the wake of the outbreak with more than 200 billion wiped off the value of shares on the london ftse 100 at the end of february but poppy trowbridge a former government special adviser told itv 's peston the threat to markets from outbreaks has been seen before ms trowbridge said previous pandemics have all forecast global recession and it 's not happened businesses of course want public safety protected first and foremost and then what they will do is put in place their own business continuity planning and that will help mitigate the costs nicola sturgeon says more needs to be done to support businesses impacted by the outbreak on wednesday the prime minister announced that uk workers affected by the covid-19 outbreakwill be entitled to sick pay from the first day they are off work a move scotland 's first minister said she welcomed nicola sturgeon added however that more needed to be done i do n't think yet collectively we have gone far enough i 've certainly asked for work to be done within the scottish government to look at the advice we give businesses the support we give businesses united kingdom day a possible new bank holiday to celebrate brexit is one step closer to becoming a reality after clearing its first parliamentary hurdle pro - brexit tory backbencher peter bone has led calls for a united kingdom day in june to celebrate brexit the union and the queen uk publishes negotiating objectives for post - brexit us trade deal nine month countdown starts as uk and eu knuckle down for trade talks his proposed bank holiday would fall on the friday nearest to june 23 the date of the eu referendum in 2016 and could also mark the queens birthday and coronation anniversary both of which fall in june the wellingborough mp said an extra day off would boost workers productivity as there is a long gap between the late may and the late august bank holidays in england scotland and wales introducing his june bank holiday creation bill mr bone said boris johnsons government had been quite sniffy about his proposals he added this has rather surprised and disappointed me i can understand the former government having reservations as they always saw the uk leaving the eu as a duty not an opportunity has boris johnson just announced no deal brexit for january 2021 government to walk away from eu trade talks as early as june whereas this government wholeheartedly believes in it so my question to them would be why not mark this great democratic event to his detractors mr bone said if there are a handful of people who reject all these things well of course they can always work on united kingdom day there are currently eight bank holidays a year in england and wales nine in scotland and 10 in northern ireland the bill was introduced without a vote with a second reading scheduled for june 26 which mr bone said would happen to be united kingdom day if it existed it has little chance of making further progress in its current form without government backing workers affected by the covid-19 outbreak in the united kingdom are entitled to sick pay from the first day they are off work so what are your rights on sick pay what should you do if you get sick and what about if you need to isolate coronavirus and claiming benefits everything you need to know i 'm employed by a company am i entitled to statutory sick pay and what does the new coronavirus legislation mean for me workers who are employed as an employee by an organisation are entitled to statutory sick pay this means you can get up to 94.25 a week for up to 28 weeks your employment status whether you 're an employee or self employed will have an effect on what sick pay you are entitled to if any at all you should check your status with your employer if you are unclear you 'll need to be classed as an employee and have done some work for your employer which could mean difficulties for those starting new roles but finding themselves sick employees need to be earning at least 118 a week to claim statutory sick pay this figure relates to your earnings before tax and is an average over a period of eight weeks if you earn less than 118 per week then you can apply for universal credit new rules mean that you 'll be paid from the first day you are off work as opposed to having to be ill for at least four days in a row you 'll need to make sure you tell your employer you 're sick before their deadline or within seven days if they do n't have one formally set those following stay at home measures and who can not work as a result will be eligible for statutory sick pay ssp even if they are not themselves sick i 'm self employed what do the new rules mean for me if you 're self employed then you wo n't be entitled to statutory sick pay self employed people who are out of work owing to coronavirus will be able to apply for universal credit which can take up to several weeks to come through frances o'grady general secretary of the trades union congress tuc said it is not good enough to suggest universal credit is what low paid workers should seek there 's a five week wait on universal credit she said if you 're bringing up a family with bills to pay how are you going to survive those five weeks with no pay at all she said boris johnson is n't putting himself into the shoes of a low paid worker if you 're faced with the choice of going into work when you should n't or being penniless it 's no choice at all employment support allowance which is paid within 10 days is also available the department for work and pensions said individual circumstances will affect what state benefits they are entitled to claim many benefits are means tested meaning your ability to claim them will depend on your savings and other income i 'm on a zero hours contract can i get statutory sick pay the citizens advice bureau advises if you 're on a zero hours contract you can still get sick pay and you should speak to your employer about it workers are advised to follow their employer 's rules around reporting their sickness in a timely manner they 'll also need to have earned more than an average of 118 per week before tax over a period of eight weeks if you are able to claim it you can get up to 94.25 a week for up to 28 weeks if you are unable to claim ssp or you do not earn enough to qualify it you can apply for uc this is being hailed as one of the most surprising political recoveries in recent american history joe biden was widely seen as dead and buried after the nomination battles in iowa and new hampshire he came a humiliating fourth and fifth place in those contests there was talk about the former vice president having to drop out of the race he had no money no energy no message but wow how that has changed overnight now biden is seen as the clear favourite for the democratic nomination he did nt just do well last night in his strongholds in the south alabama tennessee north carolina where african american voters are his core voters biden also seized massachusetts the home state of elizabeth warren he won minnesota widely seen as a progressive bastion that would favour bernie sanders and it looks almost certain that biden will win the major prize of texas another huge upset so this amounts to a big setback for the campaign of his chief rival the indefatigable bernie sanders the senator from vermont had spoken of building a unique coalition consisting of young voters hispanics and the white working class that would propel him to the nomination resurgent joe biden battles bernie sanders a critical 24 hours for democrats super tuesday the day we learn what sort of mood americans are in it did win sanders the state of california but elsewhere that coalition has fractured in the last 48 hours many democrats decided to flee to the safety of biden judging him to be a stronger candidate to face trump in november biden also benefited from a sudden consolidation of the moderate candidates amy klobuchar and pete buttigieg abandoned their campaigns and endorsed biden that was calculation not charity they can have high expectations of key jobs in a biden administration the establishments stop bernie at any cost campaign was brutally effective but there are questions left swirling in the democratic party firmament this morning can the party unite its two fractious wings will radical activist who adore sanders agree to support biden and of course the biggest imponderable of all how does biden match up against donald trump can the former vp surprise everyone and win the white house we will know in 244 days joe bidens campaign to become the democrat candidate was boosted by primary wins in many states but super tuesdays biggest prize went to rival bernie sanders the former vice presidents campaign received a timely rebound after disappointing showings at previous contests as he emerged victorious in massachusetts alabama and south carolina as well as five other states but mr sanders took california as the democratic partys once crowded presidential field appeared to transform into a two man contest it was a disappointing evening for mike bloomberg whose sole victory was in the territory of american samoa while elizabeth warren was defeated in her own state by mr biden mr sanders and mr biden lifelong politicians with starkly different visions for americas future were battling for delegates as 14 states and one us territory held a series of high stakes elections that marked the most significant day of voting in the partys 2020 presidential nomination fight mr biden played on one of his rivals lines when he told a rally in los angeles people are talking about a revolution we started a movement and without citing his surging rival by name mr sanders swiped at mr biden from a victory speech in burlington vermont you can not beat trump with the same old same old kind of politics he said ticking down a list of past policy differences with mr biden on social security trade and military force this will become a contrast in ideas a key to mr bidens success on tuesday was black voters mr biden who served two terms as barack obamas vice president won 60 % of the black vote in alabama where african americans made up more than half the democratic electorate on tuesday the democratic race has shifted dramatically over the past three days as mr biden capitalised on his commanding south carolina victory to persuade anxious establishment allies to rally behind his campaign former rivals amy klobuchar and pete buttigieg abruptly ended their campaigns and endorsed mr biden mr bidens win in south carolina his first in the 2020 election season rescued his campaign from the brink after three consecutive weak finishes last month in biden and sanders democrats have a stark choice in what kind of candidate they want to run against president donald trump in november mr sanders is a 78-year old democratic socialist who relies on an energised coalition of his partys far left flank that embraces his decades long fight to transform the nations political and economic systems while mr biden is a 77-year old lifelong leader of his partys

likely to kill themselves as in england in 2018 307 people took their own lives that year andrew 's brother raymond was among them within another year his mother also became a victim of suicide it was

disaster on tuesday they staged the latest in a series of protests outside health department offices in belfast urging ministers to declare it an emergency they want funding for mental health services to be increased from around five percent of the overall health budget its half of the budget for mental health in england says sara boyce one of the campaigners yet we have over 25 % higher rates of mental ill health here and we have to start recognising the context that we are a society coming out of conflict with high levels of inter - generational trauma the legacy of northern irelands troubles may go some way to explaining the high suicide rate today children who grew up in the shadow of violence in belfast 's most affected communities are three times more likely to take their own lives these are also some of the most deprived areas a lack of opportunity and a recent renewal of paramilitary violence have only made things worse but speak to young people and they say there is

protection britain 's youngest mp nadia whittome has opened up to the acting prime minister podcast about what it 's like being the new baby of the house entering parliament at just 23 years of age has been a whirlwind for ms whittome who went from looking for temporary christmas jobs to being the mp for nottingham east in just a matter of weeks i was looking for christmas temp work she told podcast host paul brand i 'd applied for loads of stuff paul smith a call centre poundland loads of things unfortunately or fortunately depending how you look at it she did not get accepted for any of the jobs she went for except the one where she applied to be labour 's nottingham east candidate within a month of being selected by the party she won her seat in the 2019 general election looking back at the rollercoaster month in which she hoped to earn some extra cash at christmas and ended up with a 79,500 a year job she said all 's well that ends well but the mp who describes herself as a democratic socialist has decided she will only use a small chunk of her salary for herself i 've said that i 'll take home 35,000 and i 'll give the rest to local causes and strike funds she said she explained why saying she thinks it 's important for workers ' representatives to be on a workers ' wage it 's not a criticism of other mps and it 's not saying that mps do n't work very hard we do but so do care workers firefighters teaching assistants and nurses i 'll take my pay rise when they take theirs she said on the european union ms whittome who was a firm remainer said she does n't believe it would be right to rejoin the bloc rather she said the government should work to implement good trade deals and create a visa free immigration system rather than a points based one she said visa free immigration is a workers ' right but said it should the policy should be implemented incrementally and first with countries that have similar economies to ours so that there 's no loss on either side she said she finds it a little bit patronising to be called baby of the house but she does n't mind because it gives her a platform to talk about things that people might not otherwise listen to i 've used it to raise the climate crisis to raise the immense amounts of poverty in my constituency she said despite positioning herself firmly on the left of labour ms whittome says it 's good to have representation in the party from the right as well she said she wants rebecca long bailey to be the next labour leader but said she is n't worried about the prospect of sir keir starmer winning the election and taking the party toward the centre if she herself was leader she said the first policies she 'd try to implement would be a green new deal and a livable living wage subscribe to itv

covid-19 up to 3.4 % from 1 % the government 's coronavirus action plan reveals several emergency measures could be enacted if the virus becomes a severe prolonged pandemic in a stretching scenario the 27-page document says it is possible that up to one fifth of employees may be absent from work during peak weeks in the event of the outbreak worsening pressures on society and services may become

iran is the uk running business as usual itv news john ray looks at the facts in a press conference on tuesday prime minister boris johnson said it is highly likely the uk will see a growing number of coronavirus cases but stressed that for the vast majority of people in this country we should be going about our business as usual england 's chief medical officer professor chris whitty said probably around 1 % of people who get this virus might end up dying but the death rate varies according to age group mr whitty said there is no evidence that children are particularly badly affected by this virus but added there is a significant ramp up in the death rate of those infected who are over 80 years old he stressed however that the great majority survive coronavirus even among the elderly national coronavirus plan what are the key points measures for the police if large numbers of police become infected available officers may be instructed to drop low priority cases the government action plan states to ensure critical functions are fulfilled officers may only concentrate on responding to serious crimes and maintaining public order in order to contain the spread of the virus police and medical professionals may be given the power to detain people suspected of being infected the armed forces will be on standby with well practiced arrangements to assist the police and other civil authorities should they face pressures and request assistance the army is of course always ready to back fill as and when but that is under the reasonable worst case scenario the prime minister said the nhs if nhs staff start to become affected then retirees and those on leave may be called back to duty to assist with care non - urgent care could also be delayed to prioritise triage service delivery the government wants to delay a major outbreak till the warmer months when pressure on the nhs from seasonal illnesses like flu should have reduced the document details how the health and social care systems have plans in place to ensure people receive essential care and support but sometimes this might mean that other services are reduced temporarily coronavirus what are your work travel and childcare rights sixth person in us dies from coronavirus there may also be a need to draw on the uk 's existing medical stockpiles as the requirement for medicines and other clinical counter - measures may start to increase a distribution strategy for the uk 's stockpiles of key medicines and equipment such as protective clothing which will cover the nhs and could extend to social care there could be an increase in deaths arising from the outbreak particularly amongst vulnerable and elderly groups the document said and advice will be provided to local authorities to help deal with this challenge labour leader jeremy corbyn urged the government to provide extra funding for the nhs the nhs needs support in order to cope with what could become a very serious problem throughout our health service he said i hope the government will recognise the need to put the funding in workers the government is encouraging an increase in home working to avoid a spread of the virus and says people experiencing symptoms should self isolate a growing concern among the workforce is that many people forced to self isolate could be off work without pay as itv news political editor robert peston explains when asked about the issue by itv news political editor robert peston the prime minister did not offer much reassurance to those on zero hour contracts who as things stand would not be paid while off work on the issue of statutory sick pay and the risks that the workforce could conceivably run in that reasonable worst case scenario we 're going to keep all options under review but we are well aware of the issue mr johnson said jeremy corbyn said people on zero hour contracts will not as things stand be paid if they 're forced to self isolate the government needs to be clear that it 's going to extend sick pay arrangements to all workers he said otherwise people through economic circumstances will end up not undertaking the necessary self isolation which helps to keep us all safe schools and large gatherings measures aimed at delaying the spread of the virus could include school closures and reducing the number of large scale gatherings such as football matches with some school closures already in force the department for education is setting up a helpline to manage increasing queries about coronavirus and schools outlining measures to delay the spread of the virus the government document says action that would be considered could include population distancing strategies such as school closures encouraging greater home working reducing the number of large scale gatherings to slow the spread of disease throughout the population whilst ensuring the country 's ability to continue to run as normally as possible the uk government 's education departments ' planning assumptions include the possibility of having to close educational settings in order to reduce the spread of infection we would consider such measures in order to protect vulnerable individuals with underlying illnesses and thus at greater risk of becoming seriously affected by the disease the effectiveness of these actions will need to be balanced against their impact on society travel banning travel to certain countries because of the coronavirus will make no difference if the outbreak reaches a global epidemic according to the chief scientific adviser to the government sir patrick vallance told reporters that if the covid-19 virus spreads in the uk it does n't really make more sense to say you 're at more risk somewhere else than you are here he went on once the epidemic is everywhere then actually restricting travel makes no difference at all at the moment we are certainly not recommending any change to behaviours in relation to that but england 's chief medical officer professor chris whitty said it would be more problematic for uk tourists visiting countries with a very weak health service at the peak of their epidemic this is particularly an issue for people who are older or have pre - existing health conditions he warned he added in those situations they just might want to think through the practicalities of being in a place which has a health service less strong than the nhs the latest foreign and commonwealth office advice on covid-19 only recommends against all but essential travel to mainland china and parts of south korea and northern italy advice the document reiterates how the best way for the public to help contain the virus is to regularly wash hands for at least 20 seconds it also asks the public not to spread misinformation on the virus and advises people to ensure family vaccines are up to date checking on family friends and neighbours is important and people should check foreign office advice

advice for managing covid-19 for most people the government says will be self isolation at home and simple over the counter medicines people are also warned that the strain of coronavirus is new and people have a lack of immunity to it meaning covid-19 has the potential to spread extensively on tuesday morning london mayor sadiq khan said he was avoiding shaking people 's hands in order to avoid infection but mr johnson said he is and will continue to shake hands covid-19 epidemic could be on par with financial crisis government fears mr khan said he is not shaking hands because he is unable to wash his hands as regularly as he should but mr johnson said as long as hands are washed before then hand shaking is fine he said i am shaking hands i was at a hospital the other night where i think there were coronavirus patients and i was shaking hands with everybody you will be pleased to know and i continue to shake hands people must make up their own minds but i think the scientific evidence is our judgment is that washing your hands is the crucial thing health secretary matt hancock told bbc breakfast he understood why people may not want to shake hands but added the scientific advice is that the impact of shaking hands is negligible and what really matters is that you wash your hands more often phases of response the government 's response is in four stages containing the outbreak delaying its spread and mitigating the impact of the disease once it becomes established and alongside that a research programme is aimed at improving diagnostics and treatment for the disease the government says it is currently in the contain and research phase it will escalate its response upon advice from the uk 's chief medical officers who will consider the degree of sustained transmission and failed measures in other countries when the response moves to phases delay through to mitigate there will be more regular cobra meetings and there will be more government communication with parliament and the media new laws could also be implemented to help systems and services work more effectively in tackling the outbreak video report by itv news political editor robert peston uk and scottish government modelling shows that the economic and fiscal costs of a covid-19 epidemic could be on a par with the costs of the 2008 banking crisis according to a senior government source that is what our modelling shows if millions were unable to work and significant numbers of businesses unable to trade as usual during an epidemic there would be a huge automatic rise in universal credit and other welfare payments to those quarantined further costs would be incurred from whatever schemes are put in place to shelter otherwise viable businesses from collapse coupled with any emergency top ups to health and social care spending several weeks ' until virus could shut schools and cancel events coronavirus latest your daily one minute update from itv news city sources are calculating the hit to the economy as potentially five per cent of gdp or national income which would be marginally less than the first year impact of the banking collapses but the one year impact on the public finances could be as significant as in the year after the crash because temporary rises in unemployment and under employment could be sharper than 12 years ago forcing up social security payments while tax revenues would fall very fast in 2009 the government estimates the banking crisis added around 6 percentage points to its annual deficit the budget due next week will set the framework for how the government would seek to mitigate the costs to the economy and public finances how do i self isolate and what should i do if i live with others coronavirus what are your work travel and childcare rights that said if there is such an economic shock the recovery should be much sharper than in 2009 because the financial system should not be hobbled in the way it was then another big difference between 2008 and now is there is a limit to the power of central banks like the bank of england to revive economic activity during an epidemic by cutting interest rates and creating money because cheap money does not end a quarantine that said central banks from japan to the us and uk have said in the past few days they will do whatever it takes to sustain confidence for the avoidance of doubt the government does not believe an epidemic and severe economic shock are inevitable but it is planning for the worst ps the public finance forecasts included in next weeks

he urges americans to come together ms klobuchar argued that her record of getting things done in washington and winning even in republican parts of her state would help her win traditionally democratic heartland states like wisconsin and michigan that flipped in 2016 to give donald trump the presidency she was hoping to own the moderate lane of a democratic field that grew to two dozen candidates but that got tougher when mr biden joined the race in april starting as a front runner and remaining there ms klobuchar was also quickly overshadowed by pete buttigieg a fellow midwesterner

individual matter in line with its long standing policy before praising the home office ministers and civil servants mr corbyn said if the serious allegations raised by sir philip about the home secretarys conduct are true then that would clearly constitute a breach of the ministerial code he added why without a proper investigation has the prime minister defended the home secretary calling her fantastic and saying he absolutely has confidence in her its not enough just to refer this to the cabinet office the government must now call in an external lawyer as quite rightly suggested by the union for senior civil servants the first division association a minister in breach of the ministerial code can not remain in office and should be dismissed priti patel defends pm racism claims utter nonsense cabinet reshuffle the winners and losers mr corbyn said is nt the truth that this is a government led by bullies presided over by a part time prime minister who not only ca nt be bothered to turn up but simply wo nt take the vital action required when the very integrity and credibility of the government is on the line dave penman general secretary of the fda union which represents senior civil servants said the announcement that the cabinet office has been tasked with establishing the facts in relation to the allegations being made against the home secretary falls far short of the independent inquiry we have called for the government is establishing an inquiry that civil servants are expected to have trust in whilst at the same time ministers stand at the despatch box and pledge their confidence in the home secretary we will of course work with the cabinet secretary in relation to his inquiry however the decision is symptomatic of the broader concerns we have on the lack of an independent transparent and fair process for investigating and determining complaints the chief medical officer and the government do not expect covid-19 to approach an epidemic scale until april at the earliest if it happens at all evidence suggests downing street has said temporary emergency powers to delay spread of virus will not become law till end of this month

settlements inter alia namely that there will be no degradation from the status quo and that the delivery timetable is realistic if you are on cummings side of the road the problem is whitehall defeatism in whitehall itself the crux is that politicians have no practical experience of managing or delivering anything this conflict between downing street and whitehall will define johnsons first

problem relating to the covid19 potential crisis is how to give confidence to those on low pay especially the significant numbers on zero hours contracts in retail and hospitality that if they self quarantine they wo nt suffer extreme hardship i understand the dwp is looking at this but the problem is huge and urgent because to prevent viral spread it really matters that workers do nt fear they

top up the pay of those on zero hours or short term contracts when they can not work in an expedited way finding a way to compensate the many students and young people who are nt on universal credit and lose all income when they do nt work in coffee shops restaurants and so on if the government really wants to contain or delay the spread of coronavirus then it will have to find proper money to

becomes very widespread he added right now the advice is not to cancel big events that 's the clear scientific advice it does n't have any impact now we 're not ruling out doing that later what are the symptoms of covid-19 peston government to take draconian powers to limit virus spread he said the advice was the same with school closures unless there is a positive case of somebody in that establishment then schools should not be closing despite saying on sunday it was now inevitable that the deadly virus would become endemic in the uk the health secretary did not say any extra emergency funding had been set aside to help the nhs he said it really is n't about the funding but added how the government would be open to providing the service with more cash in the future if necessary boris johnson agreed that covid-19 would like spread but said there is a plan to protect the public for when it does this is a problem that i think is likely to become more significant for this country in the next days and weeks and therefore we have been making every possible preparation for that mr johnson said after chairing an emergency cobra meeting he added we are in a position to take the steps that will be reasonable to contain the spread of the disease as far as we can and also to protect our most vulnerable the comments of the two mps followed a cobra meeting aimed at containing the coronavirus outbreak held shortly before four more people in england had been confirmed as having the disease raising the total to 39 in the uk all of them had recently travelled to italy a growing hot spot in europe itv news political editor robert peston on measures the government may use to tackle the virus on tuesday the government will publish its action plan on how it will tackle coronavirus with the number of cases in the uk growing almost daily but mr hancock said the action plan 's implementation will not depend on how many people in the uk have the virus there is n't a precise number that leads to the switch he said because a lot of it depends on what happens in other countries as well we do n't have an exact figure but that is n't because we 're holding that back it 's because the scientific judgement on when we move from trying to contain this virus into trying to delay and mitigate its onset here that decision will be a scientific judgement based in part on the decisions of others around the world he added the prime minister said it is still the case that the single most useful thing that we can all do to support our nhs to stop the spread of coronavirus is to wash our hands he added it is very important that people consider that they should go about business as usual it comes as european commission president ursula von der leyen said the eu had raised its risk level from moderate to high while a senior public health england phe official warned of more widespread infection several cities in italy remain in lockdown after 1,694 cases

talks between the uk and european union are due to start on monday with the two sides well apart on a final agreement david frost the prime ministers europe adviser and his team of negotiators will travel to brussels to kick start the nine month process of vying to secure a new trade arrangement with the eu both sides published their negotiation mandates last week revealing that they are at odds over boris johnsons push for a comprehensive canada style free trade deal as well as demands over fishing state subsidies and standards the eus chief negotiator michel barnier has said a deal like canadas which would eliminate most import taxes but still require some border checks was not suitable for britain due to its close proximity and links to the continent has boris johnson just announced no deal brexit for january 2021 brexit what you need to know about trade deals instead he wants britain to agree to sign up to a number of level playing rules set by brussels the bloc is also arguing for little to change in terms of fishing quotas and access to british waters for european boats a continuation of the status quo that ministers in westminster are vehemently against a high level meeting to take stock of progress is scheduled for june by which time it should be clear whether the canada like agreement sought by mr johnson is possible by the end of the year the eu wants to see progress on both fishing and financial services at that summer marker michael gove the cabinet minister responsible for brexit preparations said the uk would not trade away its newly recovered sovereignty during the talks our aim is to secure through a fair and measured approach a comprehensive free trade agreement and also find common ground on questions such as fisheries internal security and aviation said the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster in an article on sunday i believe we can secure a great new deal for an exciting new era but it is important that we are clear from the start that these negotiations are taking place in new times yes we want the best possible trading relationship with the eu but we will not trade away our newly recovered sovereignty french europe minister amelie de montchalin warned the prime minister that the tight december 31 deadline would not pressure the eu 27 into agreeing fresh terms she told the bbcs andrew marr programme if we need six more months we as europeans are very clear that we want a good deal a fair deal a deal that can last for many generations to come and we will not sign for the sake of having a deal it would make no sense the outbreak of coronavirus is said to be complicating cross - channel relations as negotiators prepare to start bartering the telegraph reported that downing street and the department of health and

hamper trade negotiations as a result downing street is said to have prevented health secretary matt hancock from travelling to meet counterparts to coordinate a europe wide response to the coronavirus outbreak the liberal democrats have called for the trade talks to be postponed and the deadline to be extended to allow ministers to focus on stopping coronavirus acting leader sir ed davey said then the nhs and local communities can get the funds and the focus they deserve and the uk can talk to our european neighbours about how we can cooperate against the coronavirus which does not recognise national borders there are a handful of big things to watch out for followingsir philip rutnam 's resignation as home office permanent secretary 1 whether in laying out his case for constructive dismissal evidence emerges that makes it impossible for priti patel to remain as home secretary 2 whether other permanent secretaries and senior civil servants show solidarity with rutnam thus making it harder for dominic cummings to reform how they and civil servants support the government and harder for him to streamline the centre of government and the cabinet office 3 what the soon to be published independent report into the scandal of the deportation of windrush immigrants says about the competence of the home office and rutnam 's stewardship of the home office difficult to believe this will make painless reading for rutnam just to be clear in the early days of thatcher 's and blair / brown 's time in office much of the senior civil service felt under siege offended and bruised by new prime ministers who saw traditional whitehall as resistant to the kind of radical change they wanted but the noise and tremors generated in the early days of the johnson / cummings administration are of a significantly greater magnitude that reflects the greater scale of their ambition to shake up whitehall but for the avoidance of doubt neither johnson or cummings would want this degree of conspicuous conflict with senior civil servants because it frustrates rather than speeds the reforms they want cabinet colleague comes to defence of extremely courteous home secretary priti patel amid bullying allegations top home office civil servant quits over vicious and orchestrated campaign priti patel criticises ' false allegations ' amid claims of bullying and distrust paradoxically if their henchpeople or putative allies are briefing against civil servants they are helping what johnson and cummings would see as the forces of reaction but the lesson of thatcher and blair / brown is that in the end prime ministers tend to get their way and whitehall makes an accommodation though getting there will definitely be harder and messier this time not least because it is without precedent for a permanent secretary like rutnam to sue the government for constructive dismissal listen and subscribe to our weekly politics podcast calling peston available on apple podcasts

long term strategy for ensuring covid-19 was contained was attempting to delay its peak until the summer as the virus will not spread so easily in warmer weather if the outbreak worsens the next phase

matches could be considered by the government while closing schools may be necessary speaking on bbc one 's the andrew marr show mr hancock added that despite a huge economic and social downside following china 's lead and isolating uk cities if the situation worsens currently remain possibilities we do n't take anything off the table at this stage because you have to make sure you have all the tools available if that is what is necessary the 41-year old said i 'm not saying any of these are decisions we have taken but they are things we do n't rule out the west suffolk mp added that emergency powers designed to restrict covid-19 if it becomes endemic due to be revealed this week would only be temporary" other measures include an increase in the number of emergency meetings by the

the commons their comments come almost 24 hours after sir philip 's sensational resignation a period during which no minister spoke out in defence of the embattled former international development secretary mr hancock told the bbc 's andrew marr programme priti is a very determined home secretary she is probably closer to where the public are on the issues of law and order than any home secretary in recent history i think she drives things forward i also think she is extremely courteous and in every dealing i 've had with her she has been very courteous i ca n't get into the details of the case not least because it looks like it might be going to court and i 'm not close to it asked on bbc radio 5 live whether he was accusing sir philip of lying mr hancock added i 'm not getting into that will boris johnson and dominic cummings be knocked off course by sir philip rutnam 's resignation priti patel criticises ' false allegations ' amid claims of bullying and distrust former transport minister ms ghani used her appearance on sky news to suggest that ms patel could be being judged more harshly because she is a woman she said my experience of working with priti is that she is incredibly determined she provides strong leadership and she 's delivering some very important aspects of our policy i do think it 's curious that if you 're providing leadership if you 're determined working at a fantastic pace that within men that is seen as a fantastic skill and for women sometimes it 's seen as challenging labour has looked to ramp up the pressure on the under fire home secretary with shadow chancellor john mcdonnell suggesting she could be forced to resign mr mcdonnell when asked if ms patel could stay in her post told sky news ' sophy ridge on sunday i ca n't see it it 's bizarre he added one of the ways the prime minister could go forward is to have an independent investigation but during that period you 'd have to suspend the home secretary whilst that went on labour leadership candidate sir keir starmer also called on ms patel to explain to mps the explosive allegations levelled against her by sir philip sir keir said the home secretary has a duty to come to parliament on monday to explain the allegations made about her own conduct the shadow brexit secretary called for cabinet secretary sir mark sedwill to start an immediate investigation into

secretary he said the home secretary categorically denied any involvement in this campaign to the cabinet office i regret i do not believe her she has not made the effort i would expect to dissociate herself from the comments i believe these events give me very strong grounds to claim constructive unfair dismissal and i will be pursuing that claim in the courts cabinet secretary sir mark issued a brief statement about two hours after sir philip quit saying he had accepted his resignation with great regret and adding i thank him for his long and dedicated career of public service ms patel has not publicly spoken since sir philip 's resignation but has previously denied mistreating staff video report by itv news political correspondent romilly weeks the top civil servant at the home office

what she describes as false allegations made about her amid claims of bullying and distrust from intelligence chiefs in his statement sir philip said it has been alleged that i have briefed the media against the home secretary this along with many other claims is completely false even despite this campaign i was willing to effect a reconciliation with the home secretary but despite my efforts to engage with her priti patel has made no effort to engage with me to discuss this i believe these events give me very strong grounds to claim constructive unfair dismissal and i will be pursuing that claim in the courts sir philip said he had taken the decision with great regret after a career of 33 years reacting to the resignation dave penman general secretary of the fda the senior public servants ' union said sir philip 's treatment demonstrates once again the destructive consequences of anonymous briefings against public servants who are unable to publicly defend themselves mr penman

nonsense cabinet reshuffle the winners and losers the resignation of sir philip is likely to intensify criticism of the home secretary and put renewed focus on the drive by the pm 's chief adviser

democratic candidate to take on us president donald trump in this autumn 's election may only just have begun but the man previously seen as a political outsider bernie sanders is now seen as the one to beat so far only three of the more than 50 states and territories have voted though a strong showing from the 78-year old senator in south carolina on saturday and a few days later on super tuesday could put him beyond the rest of the divided field of democratic hopefuls it is something of a riddle why does this 78-year old senator from vermont have such a remarkable appeal to a younger generation of americans?bernie sanders is hoping it takes him to the democratic nomination and all the way to the white house his message helps not just populist talk against what he calls the new oligarchy but also his praise of young voters as this country 's agents of change who are the democratic candidates seeking the partys presidential nomination bernie sanders takes a commanding lead is he now unstoppable this is generation that is anti - racist anti - sexist anti - homophobe in fact they are anti everything trump is for he told crowds of supporters in virginia if bernie sanders does not win the nomination then one critical question emerges will his core supporters vote for a centrist or establishment candidate in other words is it bernie or bust many at a sanders rally told itv news washington correspondent robert moore they would be reluctant to vote for any other democratic nominee passion is where you get voters people do n't come to vote and stand out in the cold unless they 're passionate fear does n't drive people passion does said one sanders supporter this could end up being an election against two populists vastly different but leaving many americans with

took a strategic northwestern town from assad 's forces cutting off a key syrian highway just days after the government reopened it at home erdogan 's party 's head official devlet bahceli said the situation in idlib threatens our national survival there is a recurring and important phrase in the 36-page document published this morning setting out the uk 's approach to negotiations with the european union it is these provisions should not be subject to the agreement 's dispute resolution mechanism outlined in chapter 32 what this represents is an unambiguous and seemingly non - negotiable rejection by boris johnson 's government of a demand from the eu that any free trade deal with the uk should include what it calls level playing field provisions the eu says that for the uk to have a free trade deal with the eu involving zero tariffs and zero limits on how much can be traded between the uk and eu there must be legally enforceable restrictions on the uk 's freedom to diverge from the eu on workers ' rights taxation subsidies to business and environmental protections uk to set out post - brexit eu trade plans ahead of talks brexit what you need to know about trade deals boris johnson 's riposte is that there should be a right to consult each other on any of these issues that might be considered to harm the interests of the parties but and to repeat that consultation commitment should not be subject to the agreement 's dispute resolution mechanism in other words johnson is saying he will not sacrifice any of the the uk 's rights to self determine on tax subsidies workers rights and so on as the acceptable price of a free trade deal for him any trade deal that would involve the uk being bossed around by a supranational disputes resolution body on tax workers rights etc would negate the whole point of brexit you may or may not think he is right about this but he is clear about it and by the way what this shows is that steve baker was right earlier this week when he said he was resigning as chairman of the ultra eurosceptic european research group because he and the erg had won the argument this leaves the eu with a simple and immediate decision is it worth sticking to the agreed timetable of negotiating on this basis and taking stock at the end of june or would it be far better to move immediately to talks on what boris johnson describes as his fallback position of trading with the eu on the same basis as australia an arrangement where the rules of the world trade organisation largely apply and there are plentiful tariffs on trade flows there is an argument that what boris johnson has done today is give business a ten month warning to prepare for the equivalent of a no deal brexit on 1 january 2021 what with coronavirus too the government and businesses ignore at their peril a colossal amount of complicated and costly contingency planning boris johnson will reveal his outline of his strategy for a post - brexit trade deal with the european union ahead of what are likely to be tense talks on monday the mandate for the talks published by the government on thursday will stress mr johnsons priorities of ensuring the political and economic independence of the uk from january 1 2021 it will reject the eus calls for the uk to remain closely aligned with brussels rules and standards to ensure a level playing field for competition instead it will focus on mr johnsons call for a canada style free trade agreement without the kind of conditions sought by brussels the government pointed out that other trade deals between neighbours such as the us canada and mexico did not include the kind of onerous commitments specified by brussels brexit what you need to know about trade deals the eus mandate called for any agreement to use brussels standards as a reference point over time indicating that the uk could be expected to keep aligned with changes to the rules in future something that would breach mr johnsons red lines mr johnson signed a political declaration with the eu in 2019 which accepted there should be robust commitments to ensure a level playing field on areas including state subsidies workers rights and environmental standards but downing street insiders indicated he believes the mandate he won at the general election trumps the declaration which does not have the status of a binding international treaty eu and uk set for next round of brexit talks after negotiating mandate agreed brand britain not tarnished by brexit says report in the tory election manifesto mr johnson promised no political alignment with the eu an end to the role of the european court of justice and full control of the uks fishing waters brussels chief negotiator michel barnier has insisted that fishing rights for eu vessels must be included in the deal or there wo nt be any agreement at all a downing street source said the prime minister is working to a mandate which derives from his manifesto which set out very clear what he would be seeking in the negotiations also set out what would not be acceptable to the uk and that whatever happens at the end of this year the uk will be regaining in full its political and economic independence robert jenrick reiterated the government 's stance on striking a canada style deal with the eu if we 're not able to agree that then we 'll leave with the deal that we struck at the end of last year and we 'll trade with the eu as many countries around the world do like australia for example he said mr jenrick said the government was going to be ready for the december 31 deadline and there was no suggestion of extending the deadline the uks mandate will be set out in parliament by michael gove the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster and a key player in the brexit process on the eve of the uk setting out its red lines mr barnier issued a fresh warning that the uk must accept common standards with the bloc if it wants continued preferential access to european markets he said he accepted assurances from mr johnson that he did not want to turn britain into a de - regulated singapore on thames however he said that without agreement on a series of common ground rules efforts to prevent unfair competition and to tackle climate change would be undermined speaking to an escp business school seminar in brussels he said we are ready to offer to the uk super - preferential access to our markets a level of access that would be unprecedented for a third country is this something we can do without firm guarantees that the uk will respect the level playing field and avoid unfair competitive advantages the answer i m afraid is simple we can not mr barnier said that whatever the outcome of the trade talks there would be checks on goods entering the eu from britain from the beginning of 2021 when the current transition period ends of course we love made in britain but we must guarantee that the goods we import from the uk tariff and quota free really are british we can not take the risk that the uk becomes a kind of assembly hub for goods from all over the world allowing them to enter the single market as british goods mr barnier and the pms europe adviser david frost will meet in brussels on monday for the first round of talks on the post - brexit relationship with a further session expected in london later in march sir keir starmer has told itv news political editor robert peston it was never boris johnson 's personality that got labour into trouble in the 2019 election speaking on itv 's peston show sir keir the current frontrunner in the labour leadership contest told peston we made him look good he continued i think i went to 44 constituencies with campaign teams in the uk no one reported back to me saying boris johnson is great he 's just what we want what they were saying is we want change desperately want change but we do n't trust your labour party starmer labour must regain people 's trust when asked by the peston audience via twitter who he is being funded by said well robert as you know there are very strict rules the electoral commission and the parliamentary rules require you to register all your funding and then to publish it and that s what we ve been doing my first tranche went up on the parliamentary website a few weeks ago the next tranche peston which is presumably the big tranche well the next tranche is with the parliamentary we ve given it to the parliamentary authorities they need to now i ve got a compliance team the parliamentary authorities are looking at it they check its all in order and i think its going up as soon as they give it the green light which will probably be on monday of next week as coronavirus continues to spread across europe transport secretary grant schapps said the uk has better ways of tracking those infected with the covid-19 compared to italy and has praised the nhs for its preparations when asked how serious the coronavirus outbreak could be and having to contain it mr schapps said the chief medical officer would say the risks still sits at low at the moment the uk has been exceptionally well prepared particularly the nhs however former conservative cabinet member justine greening told peston that there needed to be much earlier intervention as covid-19 the coronavirus which initiated from wuhan continues to spread she said clearly there needed to be much earlier public information i think the public should be trusted to understand the details of how coronavirus spreads the risks but also how to stay safe i would have hoped that there would have been a more coordinated effort across europe in response such as how airports are working and routes that were being monitored ms greening added she continued we 've seen this virus make more progress both in europe but then unfortunately potentially i worry in the uk than it might have done itv 's peston show also discussed harvey weinstein once one of hollywood 's most powerful producers who is facing up to 29 years in prison after a new york city jury found him guilty of sexually assaulting two women former assistant to weinstein zelda perkins said she did not blow the whistle on the disgraced film mogul but rather the legal sector enabling the powerful she said we have a system where justice can be bought and that 's why this conviction is important jacob rees mogg

shocking moments in no.10 when she learned of a series of terror attacks during her premiership speaking in depth to security editor rohit kachroo on some of the darkest moments in downing street mrs may opens up about the debt britain owes to the work of mi5 she tells itv news and itv 's tonight programme how she personally dealt with the aftermath of the bloody assaults on the british people the very people that as prime minister she was ultimately responsible for trying to keep safe she reveals to itv news how she was getting ready for bed only to be told of the manchester arena bombing atrocity the incredibly moving and incredibly heartening fallout from the attack her relationship with the security forces working to try to prevent further bloodshed how she learned an is fanatic wanted to kill her what she would say to critics holding her responsible for deaths of britons at the hands of terrorists mi5 boss andrew parker asks tech firms create a way to let us read suspects ' secret messages to stop uk terror attacks queen praises tireless work of mi5 intelligence agents the horror of manchester arena mrs may took over in downing street in july 2016 and the suicide bombing at an ariana grande concert in manchester happened in may the following year during the general election campaign there had already been an terror incident a westminster bridge where four people including a police officer had died and by the end of 2017 there had been further attacks at london bridge / borough market finsbury park mosque and on a tube train at parsons green but it was the manchester attack that brought into such sharp focus just how fine the margins are in the fight against terrorism as it happens i was in no.10 downing street but i was upstairs in the flat getting ready i think getting ready to go to bed she says there was something on the radio about something having happened in manchester but then i took a phone call from my private secretary who explained that this had been an attack that i think at that stage they thought it was a suicide bomber unable at that stage to say how many victims had been but knew that many of them were children prince william secretly shadowed britains top spies for three weeks how does mi5 prioritise terror probes she said the shock of the attack was absolute and her first thought was for the victims before as prime minister she had to turn to taking stark practical steps the boss of mi5 andrew parker briefed her on the fast developing situation things are done very quickly and lots of people being brought in to brief the pm for the pm to question and as i said to make sure that the resources are there for the investigation that s necessary she says but its always a very emotional moment because of what has happened but also a very a moment that brings you up sharp because you are sitting there you are listening at that stage to more details on exactly what 's happened i think what is reassuring is knowing that you have absolutely the most senior person taking personal interest in this and making sure that what needs to be done is being done but knowing that you as pm are receiving the best as possible information and the best possible advice at that point mrs may visited some of the survivors their families and those who were treating them over the next day or so she was asked about the emotions she was feeling following those conversations that s when it really comes home to you what this has meant and how many lives have been affected and lives who for those who survived will always remember that night its incredibly moving it 's also incredibly heartening when you see the best of humanity in the emergency services in the nhs but also when i talk to victims and their families tremendous courage and people who really have been potentially scarred for life who should hold responsibility for terror attacks by the end of 2017 there had been five terror attacks on british soil so does mrs may feel any responsibility for what happened the only people who are responsible for terrorist attacks are the terrorists she states as pm obviously you always have a task to ensure that your agencies that the police and others have the resources that they need that questions are being asked of them and how they operate but at every stage you have to constantly be looking at the lessons we are learning can we be doing this better what can we be doing working with others such as the internet companies such as other governments to ensure that we are able to have the tools available to our services so that they can do the job we want them to do but as i say at the end of the day the person responsible for the terrorist attack is the terrorist in the crosshairs in august 2018 islamic state terrorist naaimur zakariyah rahman was jailed for at least 30 years after being found guilty of a plot to kill mrs may. rahman then aged 20 planned to bomb the gates of 10 downing street kill guards and then attack the then prime minister he was snared by a network of undercover counter - terrorism officers from the metropolitan police the fbi and mi5 i was first told about it by the security service and as anybody would feel when you are told that somebody is trying to do you harm obviously its a matter of concern she tells itv news as pm you have support and as pm you have a protection team and so forth but its a natural human reaction to be concerned and be worried she adds that its not just about the pm but other members of parliament as so graphically emphasised by the murder of jo cox so do such threats such plots when they come to light leave her questioning whether going into politics is a risk worth taking no this is a job and is an important job to do being a member of parliament is an important job being able to have the honour and privilege of being pm as such it 's about serving one 's country she says when being told something like that i think you just have to receive it and recognise it and be grateful to those who are working to ensure that you are kept safe i mean that s the first thing is being grateful to all those who are putting their effort into making sure that a threat of that sort does n't materialise leading the fight mrs may had worked with andrew parker as head of mi5 while she was home secretary before she became prime minister he was on hand to brief her face to face after the manchester arena suicide bombing and its clear she has huge respect for him and the people at the security service i think first of all he 's absolutely committed to this country and to keeping this country safe he s very calm which is what you need in these circumstances as an individual and somebody who i think over time has led the issues that mi5 face has changed he has led them through some changes in a very capable and very good way but also somebody who recognises that the importance of ensuring that staff are comfortable in what they are doing comfortable in the decisions that they are taking which is very important she goes on what is important is that we have in organisations like mi5 people who are willing to have quite a different life from others by nature if you are working for an organisation of secrecy like that you have to be somebody of secrecy but we are fortunate that we have absolute first class people who put themselves forward to undertake that work and to commit it to keeping us safe they are in a very quiet way a very impressive group of people mi5 spies speak for first time about their covert work from foiling attacks to secretly come dancing competitions watch more of our interview with sir andrew parker plus current mi5 spies talking on camera for the first time about

ambiguity at all around that the trade agreement will be associated with a fisheries agreement and an agreement about a level playing field or there wo n't be any agreement at all mr barnier said the negotiations would be complex demanding and difficult he added we have very little time ahead of us we will use it as effectively as intelligently as possible let 's get this negotiation done and off to a good start the eu said it wants to secure a free trade agreement with the uk but this would require the uk to agree to cooperation on customs and regulatory aspects something which the prime minister has previously ruled out they also stressed that a future partnership between the uk and eu be underpinned by robust commitments to ensure a level playing field for open and fair competition given the eu and the uk 's geographic proximity and economic interdependence croatian europe minister andreja metelko zgombic said the council has adopted a clear and strong mandate for our negotiator michel barnier this confirms our readiness to offer an ambitious wide ranging and balanced partnership to the uk for the benefit of both sides the eu is now ready to start negotiations ireland 's

office read the eu has respected the autonomy of other major economies around the world such as canada and japan when signing trade deals with them we just want the same we agree the uk 's trade with the eu is significant the us 's is on the same scale yet that did not stop the eu being willing to offer the us zero tariffs without the kind of level playing field commitments or the legal oversight they have put in today 's mandate british ministers are expected to seek a canada style agreement with zero tariffs a proposal mr johnson and his europe adviser david frost have set out in speeches in recent weeks the tight time schedule for the talks remains an issue with european ministers voicing concerns over the prime minister 's unwillingness to extend the deadline beyond december mr barnier said the bloc would not agree a deal at any price and warned that the deadline set by the uk could limit the scope of the agreement in a very brief period you ca n't do everything we will do as much as we can under pressure of time he said lord steel has resigned from the liberal democrats and will resign from the house of lords after an inquiry into child sex abuse claimed the political establishment turned a blind eye to allegations former liberal leader steel was criticised in the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse iicsa report after he failed to report allegations against colleague sir cyril smith responding to the report lord steel said knowing all i know now i condemn cyril smith 's actions towards children children deserve protection from predators especially those in authority dealing with such cases is the iicsa 's legitimate role i believe in the highest standards of human rights particularly for young and vulnerable people he added i regret the time spent on pursuing leon brittan lord bramall and others who it is clear had done no wrong not having secured a parliamentary scalp i fear that i have been made a proxy for cyril smith following steel 's resignation an alleged victim of cyril smith demanded he be punished for not acting it added that political institutions have significantly failed in their responses to allegations failing to recognise abuse covering up allegations and actively protecting high profile offenders including politicians but crucially the report also concludes there was no evidence of any kind of an organised westminster paedophile network in which persons of prominence conspired to pass children amongst themselves for the purposes of sexual abuse lord steel and cyril smith were not the only politicians to come under fire in the report david steel should be stripped of his knighthood just like cyril smith stripped me the alleged victim told itv news he says lord steel had an opportunity to speak out about the abuse but said he and others failed us for their own political gain he said the party came first we did n't come first adding david steel did n't think about us we were nothing political establishment repeatedly covered up child sex abuse allegations investigation finds he added i 'm 71 years of age now and i 'm still fighting the i call it the scars that i have to keep because of something that happened to me when i was little and it will never go away the iisca report said on tuesday there was a political culture which values its reputation far higher than the fate of the children previously in westminster senior conservatives are also criticised over the case of former cabinet member sir peter morrison who died in 1995 the report says senior officials within the conservative party knew about allegations concerning morrison for years but did not pass them on when it was alleged that morrison had been caught by police abusing a 15-year old boy the report stated that the evidence shows his party made efforts to suppress these rumours rather than conduct a formal investigation knowledge of the allegations went to the very top of the government the report said margaret thatcher was aware of rumours about morrison but did nothing and neither did party chairman norman tebbit mi5 or the cabinet office political status was repeatedly valued above the welfare of children because of a consistent pattern of deference towards people of public political status an investigation into child sex abuse in westminster has found the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse iicsa report found a political culture which values its reputation far higher than the fate of the children iicsas latest report says that political institutions have significantly failed in their responses to allegations failing to recognise abuse covering up allegations and actively protecting high profile offenders including politicians but crucially the report also concludes there was no evidence of any kind of organised westminster paedophile network in which persons of prominence conspired to pass children amongst themselves for the purposes of sexual abuse neither was evidence found of any attempt to cover up such a network a number of political parties and high profile figures many of them now dead come in for criticism amongst those still alive are former liberal leader lord steel who did nothing about allegations around the liberal mp cyril smith now known to have been a serious predatory paedophile steel told the inquiry he did not investigate the allegations because they had happened before smith was a member of his party the report said this failure to recognise the risks was an abdication of responsibility and the fact the offences were non - recent was irrelevant following the report 's publication the liberal democrats said they would be thoroughly reading the report by the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse a party spokeswoman said cyril smith 's acts were vile and repugnant we have nothing but sympathy for those whose lives he ruined this is an important inquiry and we are thoroughly reading its report senior conservatives are also criticised over the case of former cabinet member sir peter morrison who died in 1995 the report says senior officials within the conservative party knew about allegations concerning morrison for

charges against him including rape and sexual assault of a child he was later sentenced to 22 years in prison shockingly the report finds the conservatives plaid cymru ukip and the cooperative party still do not have proper safeguarding policies in place iicsa recommends that all parties must have comprehensive safeguarding policies and urges cabinet office to re - examine its policy on forfeiture of honours chair of the inquiry professor alexis jay obe said it is clear to see that westminster institutions have repeatedly failed to deal with allegations of child sexual abuse from turning a blind eye to actively shielding abusers a consistent pattern emerged of failures to put the welfare of children above political status although we found no evidence of an organised network of paedophiles within government we hope this report and its recommendations will lead political institutions to prioritise the needs and safety of vulnerable children former egyptian president hosni

rayner has criticised jeremy corbyn saying the labour leader did n't command respect as she labelled the party 's brexit position as awful ms rayner who is the favourite to become labour 's deputy leader told itv news political correspondent paul brand that she 'd be tougher than mr corbyn in several ways i 'm more bombastic more focused and more sharp and i would expect more discipline in a way that jeremy did n't she said he did n't command respect and he therefore was n't able to command that collectivism in the labour party touting her leadership credentials she said she has respect and support right across the labour party and claimed she is able to resonate with people in the country in a way that jeremy does n't and in another bid to distance herself from mr corbyn she suggested unlike leadership candidate rebecca long bailey that the current leader should not be admitted to the shadow cabinet once he 's been replaced during the interview with paul brand ms rayner also appeared on camera with her mother for the first time as the pair opened up about depression and poverty when asked about mr corbyn 's potential role on the frontbench she said i think now the opportunity should be for the next generation to come forward labour 's rayner announces bid to be deputy and backs long bailey as leader how is the new labour leader being selected and when will they replace corbyn labour members begin voting for jeremy corbyns successor i do think we have to show that we 're different and that we 're bringing new talent in and we have to show that we do want to do that and change as a party she added she also attacked his election manifesto brexit position and security stance our brexit position was awful people did not accept where we were at on that she told paul brand and our manifesto was too much people just did n't think it was credible and she claimed she would be more pragmatic than mr corbyn in terms of security she said i think i 'm stronger on security i 've always felt quite strong about that adding i do n't think he was weak but i think he had a more international view of things whereas i 'm more pragmatic i understand the international context but i also understand most people in this country just want to know that you 're going to keep people safe and look after them and that 's my primary she went on a lot of people did n't think that 's what jeremy 's primary aim was for more from angela rayner listen to the acting prime minister podcast which will be published before 10 pm monday angela rayner and her mother

stable way or else i would nt be sitting here today and look at her look where she is she said taken aback at hearing the praise ms rayner said my mum does nt say stuff like that often so its nice its nice that my mum is proud of me because i m proud of her it may seem a harrowing experience but for ms rayner who had a child herself at the age of 16 looking after her mother was all she ever knew i remember being scared remember staying at the bottom of my mums bed once thinking is my mum going to do something and not wanting to go to sleep because i did nt want to go to sleep and think my mum would nt be there in the morning and that was quite traumatic she told paul ms bowen admits her daughter had it rough and sometimes gets upset with the way that angie has had to grow up pretty fast i always picture her as the mum when i was having that really dark time because i was acting like a baby because that s all i could do she added ms rayner remembers the tough times looking back to a period when her mother was on benefits with no food in the cupboards we grew up in poverty you were on giros were nt you you were on benefits she said to her mum during the interview we was waiting for food to come into the cupboards and stuff she added but ms rayner 's mum believes the tough childhood made her a lot stronger and ms rayner agrees i was so frightened of what i saw my mum go through that i never wanted to experience that so therefore i ve always been quite resilient as an individual because of that because i ve not wanted to end up in that place because i ve seen how painful it was she said ms rayner who wants to succeed tom watson as the next deputy leader of labour also criticised the party 's current leader in the interview she said jeremy corbyn who is due to

proposals plans have been unveiled by the home office to introduce legislation which would mean the owners and operators of public spaces must consider the risks of a terror attack and what measures they will take to prepare for such an event such measures which would need to be proportionate and reasonable could include increasing physical security and developing response plans for staff on what to do during an incident it follows the bomb attack at the manchester arena in 2017 as well as incidents at fishmongers hall and streatham in the last six months the play celebrating arena victim and corrie superfan martyn hett a new protect duty will be consulted on by the government in spring following discussions with victims groups such as the martyns law campaign established by figen murray whose son martyn hett was killed in the manchester arena attack speaking to itv news she said martyn 's law is about proportionate security depending on the size of the venue but that 's the whole point of the consultation to ascertain what is needed at what venue and what establishment she added it could just be let 's take for instance a pub it could just be doing a risk assessment of a possible terrorist attack it could be the necessity to put a lock on a door that was n't locked before or add an extra camera it 's that kind of simple thing for some places bells ring out across manchester marking moment of attack security minister james brokenshire said the consultation will ensure the legislation protects the public while not putting pressure on businesses our first priority is keeping the public safe and preventing more families from suffering the heartbreak of losing a loved one said mr brokenshire the devastating attacks in 2017 and more recently at fishmongers hall and streatham are stark reminders of the current threat we face we are in complete agreement with campaigners such as figen murray on the importance of venues and public spaces having effective and proportionate protective security and preparedness measures to keep people safe of course it is important that this new law is proportionate this public consultation will ensure we put in place a law that will help protect the public while not putting undue pressure on businesses martyn hett remembered at fabulous funeral service labours shadow security minister nick thomas symonds paid tribute to the campaigners who have lobbied for the change and said there can be no objection to a proper consultation however a duty to protect is no substitute for professional policing

wharf group supports this initiative and look forward to assisting where we can in shaping this work martyn hett 's mother pays tribute to smiling son liberal democrat home affairs spokeswoman christine jardine said too many lives have been tragically cut short by terrorist attacks in recent years it is therefore welcome that the work of campaigners such as figen murray have been recognised and to make sure this law is effective and we can properly assess what improvements are needed the government must urgently publish the latest annual report on existing counter - terror laws from the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation now months overdue the government has the ultimate responsibility for keeping people safe so this new law needs to be backed up with the money and

being made about her amid claims of bullying and distrust from intelligence chiefs an ally to the home secretary said she was absolutely livid about the recent slew of allegations and insisted she was demanding a leak inquiry to be carried out by the cabinet office cabinet office sources were adamant however that a request had not been received either formally or informally exposing an apparent escalation of the row priti patel defends pm racism claims ' utter nonsense low skilled migrant workers to be denied visas after brexit the government on sunday moved to strongly deny claims that mi5 chiefs do not trust ms patel and were limiting intelligence sharing the latest allegation came after the home secretary was accused of bullying officials and creating an atmosphere of fear at the department allegations allies of ms patel deny it emerged last week the mp for witham had tried to move permanent secretary sir philip rutnam from her department after they had a series of rows cabinet reshuffle sajid javid says he had no option but to resign cabinet reshuffle the winners and losers why has sajid javid quit as chancellor in a row over his closest aides asks robert peston on sunday a home office spokesman said the home secretary and permanent secretary are deeply concerned about the number of false allegations appearing in the media they are focused on delivering on the home offices hugely important agenda which includes creating an immigration system that works for the uk putting more police on the streets and keeping the public safe from terrorism the security services were dragged into the row when the sunday times reported officials alleging intelligence chiefs do not trust her and have decided to share less intelligence with her blue passports to be issued from next month to mark brexit responding to the reports a government spokesman said the home secretary and mi5 have a strong and close working relationship and baseless claims to the contrary are both wrong and against the public interest the home secretary receives the same daily intelligence briefings as her predecessors and no information is being withheld an ally said ms patel asked the cabinet offices director general of propriety and ethics helen macnamara to carry out a formal leak inquiry but added that ms macnamara has so far blocked the attempt this however was quickly denied by cabinet office sources who moved to say no request had been made to ms macnamara bullying and harassment allowed to thrive in the house of commons report finds home office minister james brokenshire said ms patel is demanding but he does not accept claims that she is a bully mr brokenshire labelled the reports about ms patel false and said he simply did not recognise the allegations and assertions being made the mp for old bexley and sidcup said the home office was a challenging and difficult place to work due to the issues such as terrorism and border control that it deals with and that ms patel had to be challenging in order to meet these demands he continued public safety was at the forefront of ms patel 's mind and that she was committed to delivering the government 's agenda he added that the allegations being made against ms patel would not distract her or the government from the task at hand tory former cabinet minister theresa villiers said there was an element of misogyny in the briefings telling bbc radio 4s today programme i m sick of spiteful briefings against women in high public office it happens again and again and i do nt believe these allegations against priti patel i think she s a highly effective home secretary and i think whoever is making these briefings should stop it because i think they are unfair and they are damaging meanwhile shadow brexit secretary sir keir starmer said the bullying claims suggested something is going very very wrong in ms patel 's department and we need to get to the bottom of it because the home office is a very very important department the labour leadership hopeful added he did not personally know how she has behaved but the allegations suggested the government is really not functioning in the way that it should asked about the claims that mi5 chiefs were limiting the information they give to ms patel sir keir said it would be very detrimental if they were true the holborn and st pancras mp suggested both sets of claims should be investigated by the home affairs select committee the environment secretary has refused to rule out chlorinated chicken and hormone treated beef being imported from the us in a post - brexit trade deal george eustice also defended the governments new immigration system after businesses raised fears of a shortage of workers his predecessor before the recent reshuffle had insisted controversial food products from the states would not be imported amid animal welfare and environmental fears but mr eustice while saying there are no plans to change the law did not explicitly rule it out when pressed three times on the subject with the government expected to publish its negotiating position for a free trade deal with washington within two weeks he told sky newss sophy ridge on sunday that the government would not take risks on standards of welfare nfu do nt allow low standard food imports on supermarket shelves after brexit but he said lactic acid washes are now more commonly used in the us than chlorine which is unlikely to allay fears over animal welfare because concerns centre on treatment before the washes themselves what i m saying is we wo nt make any moves on our standards we ve got a clear position in this country that it is illegal to sell chlorine washed chicken illegal to sell beef treated with hormones we have no plans to change those things he said consumer group which was highly critical of the comments and demanded that ministers legislate to ensure current high principles are preserved and reinforced in future trade deals sue davies its head of consumer protection and food policy said it is astonishing that instead of improved food safety and health chemical washing techniques for chicken and hormone treated beef are still being left on the negotiating table when the debate has to be firmly focused on the food standards consumers want national farmers union president minette batters called for the government to add protections into law to prevent imports that fails to meet our food safety animal welfare and environmental standards if it does nt it will not only fail our farmers but the public too who quite rightly demand and expect these standards from our own farmers she added brexit what you need to know about trade deals labours shadow environment secretary luke pollard called for the tories to introduce a ban on trade deals lowering welfare and environmental standards chlorinated chicken being sold in britain is a genuine risk unless this backdoor to lower standard us goods imports is closed and a ban is put into law he said tim farron the liberal democrats food and rural affairs spokesman accused the conservatives of having backed down on their commitment with the tories desperation for a trade deal with donald trump it would appear they are rolling back on their promises he said theresa villiers who was relegated from leading the environment department to the backbenches in boris johnsons reshuffle had been explicit in january that the eu laws banning chlorinated chicken and hormone treated beef would be adopted here there are legal barriers to their import and those are going to stay in place she added after his major speech setting out his post - brexit vision boris johnson criticised hysterical coverage that described us food as inferior i totally understand the concerns about chlorinated chicken because its not a hygiene issue its an animal welfare issue he added and what we will do is use our negotiations to persuade our partners if they want to trade freely with us then they have to accept our approach to animal welfare the governments immigration plans set out this week are designed to cut the number of low skilled migrants entering the uk the plans have drawn criticism from businesses for choking off a supply of workers that they need to operate mr eustice who used to run a strawberry farm stressed a seasonal agricultural workers scheme will be an important part of immigration policy in the future he said there would be a quadrupling of the size of the scheme to 10,000 initially this year but this still falls short of national farmers union calls for 70,000 mr eustice said ministers would be working out a fully fledged programme for the future home secretary priti patel had suggested lower skilled jobs could be filled by eight million people classed as economically inactive but she drew criticism after it was pointed out that the office for national statistics estimates most of these are students long term sick carers or retired i do nt think the home secretary was saying that all eight million of those people would be able to fill these just that there are people there who might he told sky ministers are expected to recommit to seeking to obtain a canada style agreement with brussels in the negotiating mandate scheduled for publication on thursday but this could set up a clash with the eu after its chief negotiator michel barnier ruled out the possibility the uk could have the same deal as the north american nation while the uk formally left the eu on january 31 it is

brexit trade deal with the eu ministers are expected to recommit to seeking to obtain a canada style agreement in the negotiating mandate scheduled for publication on thursday but this could set up a clash with the eu after its chief negotiator michel barnier ruled out the possibility the uk can have the same deal as the north american nation the government is expected to publish its negotiating mandate for a desired free trade agreement with the us the following week no surprises were being billed for the uks demands from brussels with boris johnsons europe adviser david frost having delivered a major speech this week he dismissed signing up to a level playing field setting common rules and standards to prevent businesses in the uk undercutting those in the bloc which earned a rebuke from mr barnier the eu negotiator said a trade agreement that includes in particular fishing and includes a level playing field with a country that has a very particular proximity a unique territorial and economic closeness it ca nt be compared to canada or south korea or japan canadas deal took seven years to negotiate with import tariffs eliminated on most goods between the nation and the bloc though some customs and vat checks remain while the uk formally left the eu on january 31 it is currently in a transition period during which it follows brussels rules without having a say in how they are made the transition is due to finish on december 31 and the prime minister has repeatedly vowed not to extend it but there have been fears this is too little time to strike the ambitious deal and the uk could plummet out of the bloc and be hit with high trade tariffs we 'll set laws that suit us chief brexit negotiator insists britain will not accept eu demands the pm is to convene his brexit cabinet on tuesday to sign off on the mandate before it is published online and laid in parliament on thursday mr frost and his team will then head to brussels for the first round of

to greece the family of harry dunn has called for julian assange not to be extradited as long as the us refuses to send the suspect in the teenagers death back to the uk the 19-year olds parents have said they believe any further extradition requests by the us should be refused after us secretary of state mike pompeo rejected the return of the woman involved in their sons death anne sacoolas last month their spokesman radd seiger said the foreign affairs committee had accepted their request for an inquiry into the extradition and to the diplomatic immunity granted to mrs sacoolas earlier this month the foreign office said they had no plans to launch a public inquiry into the case saying the case had been handled properly and lawfully throughout the teenager was killed when his motorbike crashed into a car driven by mrs sacoolas outside a us military base in northamptonshire on august 27 last year hundreds protest against extradition of julian assange ahead of hearing mrs sacoolas the 42-year old wife of an intelligence official based at raf croughton was granted diplomatic immunity after the crash and sparked international controversy after being allowed to return to her home country she was later charged with causing mr dunns death by dangerous driving mr dunns mother charlotte charles and father tim dunn said they were told by foreign secretary dominic raab that the government was reviewing all our options after mr pompeos refusal to extradite mrs sacoolas speaking about mr assanges potential extradition to the us mr seiger said harry dunns family understand and respect the importance of extradition procedures between nations and the huge public interest that attaches to extradition no one is above the law and no one must be allowed to evade justice if they manage to flee a country whether diplomat or not that said in refusing the uks perfectly lawful request to extradite anne sacoolas and not even following the legal and judicial process the us / uk treaty calls for the us has launched the single greatest attack on the so called special relationship between the countries in modern memory car seen on wrong side of road outside raf base near where harry dunn died mr seiger continued the us is not behaving like an ally and has effectively thumbed its nose up at the uk and ignored the clearly laid out provisions in the treaty effectively tearing it up the principle of reciprocity is at the core of any extradition treaty despite its disgraceful refusal to extradite anne sacoolas the us continues to seek the extradition of people in the uk such as julian assange in doing so they are demonstrating an extraordinary amount of hypocrisy and the double standards on display are unprecedented the us needs to be brought firmly back into line on the international stage and be made to understand that they are not going to have their way mr seigers comments followed saturdays protest in which hundreds of assanges supporters marched through london ahead of next weeks full extradition hearing calling for the government to block the extradition request mr seiger said in accordance with the principle of reciprocity which the us is failing to abide by on behalf of harry dunns family and the millions of concerned citizens in the uk i now demand that the uk authorities block any further extraditions to the us including the one of julian assange until such time as anne sacoolas is extradited and back on uk soil facing the justice system here dominic raab told us when we met with him on january 27 that we are reviewing all our options following the refusal to extradite anne sacoolas i now call him to exercise that option of refusing to extradite julian assange and others to the usa it is high time that the uk government comes out and shows us what they are made of if they are to instill any confidence that they really do have our backs harrys family having been so badly let down following his death last august the race for the democratic nomination has just passed a critical milestone the presidential candidates have been tested in three key parts of the country the american heartland iowa the north east new hampshire and now in the racially diverse american west the results of the nevada caucus came in overnight and they confirmed what many suspected senator bernie sanders is gathering serious momentum ahead of the next major round of contests hispanics flocked to his banner he won over union voters young voters and black voters he is already the clear favourite to win the democratic nomination and within ten days he may become unstoppable the battle of new hampshire multiple candidates gain the big mo that s pretty remarkable when you stop to think about it the democrats are desperate to oust president trump from the white house many of them believe americas very future as a functioning liberal democracy depends on it and yet they appear likely to choose a 78-year old self described democratic socialist who is certain to alienate many suburban women centrist americans and independent voters the very groups that democrats will need in november but bernie sanders has attributes that make him a wildly popular figure among young millennials and party activists he has been consistent for decades he is not talking of gentle incremental reform no tinkering for bernie rather the vermont senator wants a policy revolution free medical care for all free college education a tax on the richest americans an end to the fossil fuel industry a green new deal an economy that is tilted away from wall street and that significantly redistributes power and wealth that s routine stuff for the european left its revolutionary talk for america and heres the risk the radical bernie message might work if america faced a great recession an economic crisis high unemployment major wars and falling wages but can it work when american employment is at an all time high and by many barometers the economy is doing exceptionally well with the stock market soaring in other words will americans really vote for a revolution when things are going well certainly trump appears ecstatic at the prospect of running against sanders in november he is already congratulating the candidate and with a heavy dose of political provocation warning bernie that the democratic party establishment wo nt tolerate his victory next up is south carolina on saturday that may be joe bidens last stand and then in 10 days time we arrive at super tuesday march 3 when a large number of key states all vote on the same day if sanders does well in those contests he will be marching to the nomination but it may fracture the very coalition of voters that democrats require if they want to win the white house it is difficult seeing bernie pivoting towards the middle ground after all his primary appeal is his very consistency he is a radical candidate promising major structural change to america or he is nothing video

business secretary ms long bailey long bailey has said she would support whoever is elected in the labour leadership contest should her own campaign fail speaking to an audience of labour supporters in the function room of a bar in peterborough she said i might not agree with everything they do and i might speak to them in private and have a go at them for not adopting all of the policies that i want to adopt but i 'll never criticise them in public because that would not get us into a position where we 'd ever win a general election but ahead of that speech ms nandy said of the housing

years originally recommended by the justice department were excessive stones lawyers had asked for a sentence of probation citing his age of 67 years his health and his lack of criminal history the

trump took to twitter to denounce as a miscarriage of justice the initial recommendation by justice department prosecutors that stone receive at least seven years in prison mr barr then backed off

a wide ranging interview for the acting prime minister podcast which you can watch in full above mr clarke said the bbc is a hugely respected institution here and abroad that the government should not

slightly less than they regard the nhs its not an institution you can take apart and make it go out and compete on a smaller scale with other independent broadcasters he told podcast presenter paul brand it looks as though somebody wants to take the bbc on and attributed rumours to off the record briefings in reference to comments made earlier in the podcast regarding boris johnson 's top aide

brexit what you need to know about trade deals well left wingers think its right wing it is and i m glad to say extremely balanced the veteran tory who served the party as a nottinghamshire mp for 49 years before standing down in december said the licence fee is a strange tax that might need tidying up he said for example it 's a joke that he is entitled to free a free tv licence because he is over 75 he 's 79 years old as a flat rate license on every household you could improve it but certainly stop giving free ones as a prize he added for poorer pensioners there is a case for saying they 'd be very lonely without it but people like me do not need a free tv licence mr clarke who was a minister for three different prime ministers also told acting prime minister what it was like working

parents came to the uk from uganda in the 1960s several years before ugandan asians were expelled from the country by dictator idi amin mr ferrari asked the home secretary under her new rules you would n't be here she replied yeah but also let 's not forget we are not changing our approach to refugees and asylum seekers which is very different to a points based system for employment and that particular route itv news political correspondent libby wiener explains the history of immigration policy corina grigoruta careworker at saint cecilia 's care home said the new rules are discriminatory to immigrants it 's a bit tricky but it 's discrimination first of all for the people they will not have the possibility to try at least to try she told itv news ian robinson a partner at the immigration law firm fragomen told itv news the difference with the new system is the uk can now control european migration because of brexit they 're doing everything they can to control it while the policy objectives have n't changed the levers they have to achieve them are so much stronger now mr robinson said itv news business and economics editor explains the potential impact on the british economy however he said the changes to immigration rules should not come as a surprise to employers as they have been a long time coming but few are ready from the beginning of next year if you need a person to fill a low skill job you have to look locally or you do n't get them at all lots of companies will need to adjust their business model its going to have a bit of a shock to some parts of the economy he added mr robinson said ideally companies need a couple of years to deal with immigration changes not 10 months immigration expert ian robinson said the change in immigration rules will be a shock to some parts of the economy shadow home secretary diane abbott also criticised the plans accusing the government of trying to reach arbitary numerical targets rather than doing what is best for the country she said the problem with these new immigration policies is that the government is so anxious to look as if it is cracking down on immigration that it 's not thought through the effects of these policies on the economy as a whole there are important sectors like social care for instance where the salary threshold they 're talking about is very hard to recurit people she added we know the country wants a fair system and we would try to have a fair system this system is full of holes and wo n't work the government came under fire for telling employers they will need to adjust after deciding it will not offer visas to low skilled migrant workers industry leaders said the new immigration rules could spell absolute disaster for the care system what impact will the new rules have on british businesses itv news national editor allegra stratton has been to blackpool to find out the confederation of british industry cbi warned care construction hospitality food and drink companies could be most affected by the changes the business organisation hit out at the lack of provision for low paid workers in the proposals while lawyers urged the government not to turn the tap off overnight if companies struggle to recruit staff under the new system what are the new immigration rules the new points based system will require people to gain 70 points if they want to live and work in the uk employers have until january 1 2021 to meet the requirements and ensure the staff they employ have a right to work in the uk points are awarded for key requirements being able to speak english would result in 10 points having a job offer from an approved sponsor is 20 points and those wanting to work in the uk must meet a minimum salary threshold eu and non - eu citizens will be treated equally with criminal background checks carried out on everyone coming to the uk affecting applications of anyone who has been given a prison sentence of 12 months or more top priority will be given to those with the highest skills and the greatest talents like scientists engineers and academics who may not need a job offer to be allowed in other points will be awarded for certain qualifications and if there is a shortage in a particular occupation unison assistant general secretary christina mcanea said the plans spell absolute disaster for the care sector dame donna kinnair chief executive and general secretary of the royal college of nursing raised concerns that the proposals will not meet the health and care needs of the population the uk homecare association said it was dismayed by the governments decision adding cutting off the supply of prospective careworkers under a new migration system will pave the way for more people waiting unnecessarily in hospital or going without care telling employers to adjust in a grossly underfunded care system is simply irresponsible national farmers union president minette batters expressed serious concerns about the governments failure to recognise british food and farmings needs in the proposals mark harrison of the food and drink federation fdf raised concerns about bakers meat processors and workers producing food like cheese and pasta not qualifying under the new regime boris johnsons government has set out its plans for a new points based immigration system to come into force at the start of 2021 the new system aims to fulfill a major manifesto pledge of ending freedom of movement and reforming the countrys immigration policy in a policy statement the government said it would be repealing laws surrounding freedom of movement and that a new immigration bill will be introduced what happens to skilled workers who want to come to the uk both eu and non - eu citizens will have to gain 70 points under the new system to be eligible to apply for a visa the three key requirements which have to be met are have a job offer from an approved sponsor such as an employer cleared by the home office which earns 20 points have a job offer that is at a required skill level 20 points they can speak english to a certain level 10 points other points can be awarded for certain qualifications and if there is a shortage in a particular occupation the salary threshold for skilled migrants will be lowered from 30,000 to 25,600 for those coming to the uk with a job offer but if an applicant earns less than the required minimum salary threshold but no less than 20,480 they may still be able to come to the uk if they have a job offer in a specific occupation which appears on the government 's jobs shortage list or if they have a phd relevant to the job this could mean lower earners such as nurses may still be able to apply for a visa provided a shortage of staff in this area remain on the approved list what happens to highly skilled workers who want to come to the uk there is also now no cap on the number of people who can come through the skilled worker route this would allow a small number of the most highly skilled workers who can gain the required level of points to enter the uk without a job offer if they are endorsed by a relevant and competent body this will include science technology engineering and mathematics professionals points will be awarded for factors such as academic qualifications age and relevant work experience and the route would be capped what about low skilled workers there will be no temporary or general visa options for low skilled migrant workers the policy paper says that businesses will need to adapt and adjust to the end of free movement and we will not seek to recreate the outcomes from free movement within the points based system it is estimated 70 % of the existing eu workforce would not meet the requirements of the skilled worker route which will help to bring overall numbers down in future according to the home office lastly what about students any student from abroad who wants to study in the uk will need to show they have an offer from an approved educational institution can speak english and can support themselves financially during their studies in the uk to make the system more attractive following graduation you can stay in the country for two years former tory chancellor ken clarke has attacked the way boris johnson runs his government and said top adviser dominic cummings can only continue in his role if he vanishes the former father of the house criticised mr cummings for frequently being in the news and claimed he can only last in number 10 if the personal appearances stop and he vanishes and he goes back to being the back room apparatchik in a candid interview for the acting prime minister podcast which will air in full on wednesday mr clarke laid into the prime minister for allowing policy updates to be made via leaks to newspapers by mr cummings you ca nt go on like this you ca nt govern a country and explain what you re doing for the public by the medium of leaks from an exotic aide in number 10 he said he told podcast host paul brand it is not mr cummings ' job to brief newspapers and claimed what he tells them is absolute nonsense he went on it will after time become ridiculous and actually it will go wrong there are plenty of bad news gaffs that keep occurring now when asked if mr cummings holds too much of a strong position mr clarke said i do n't know what power he has but he should n't have the power of the prime minister he just has the ear of the prime minister no10 aide jumped before he was pushed after controversial comments exposed downing street advisor andrew sabisky quits amid eugenics comments row mr clarke who served on the frontbench for three different prime ministers said all leaders need a chief adviser but they do nt normally dress exotically and pose for the photographers before giving quite blatantly briefings all over the place about what their views are on everything he says he does n't know whether mr cummings loves the vast amount of publicity he s getting but said in his experience it had always been regarded as an absolute disaster if the chief adviser became the story in the newspapers mr clarke who resigned as an mp ahead of the december general election after 49 years of service also commented on the recent appointment and subsequent resignation of another aide andrew sabisky he said i do nt think this needs this vast number of apparatchiks all this started with tony blair who started bringing these types of people in the tory grandee said the media has made a caricature of mr cummings ' personality but mr clarke having never met the pm 's adviser said he has no idea whether he s the rather bizarre crackpot figure which the newspapers like to make him out to be mr clarke said he does not think mr cummings has too much influence over the prime minister he said mr johnson the man who expelled him from the tory party over brexit would not become the creature of some svengali machiavelli figure

background are more likely to abort baby girls speaking to a colleague of a mine she looked at me in astonishment and said you know you 're having a girl because normally they do n't tell people of asian origin they 're having a girl because you know then asian people decide and i looked at her and i could n't believe what she was saying she told itv news mps also spoke of the racial profiling and prejudice they ve faced within the houses of parliament several highlighted how they had been mistaken for other mps throughout their time in westminster while another said they were told a lift designated for mps was not for cleaners dawn butler labour mp for brent central told itv news of how she was once escorted out of an mp only room by security a police officer came to physically escort

necessary steps to ensure this does not happen in future the uk 's chief brexit negotiator has insisted the uk will set its own laws and not accept demands for a level playing field following britain 's full departure from the eu at the end of this year david frost used a major speech in brussels on monday to state that britain will not accept eu supervision to create a level playing field the move comes after france warned the two sides would rip each other apart in trade talks ahead of the uk 's scheduled exit from a brexit transition period at the end of this year mr frost said it is central to our vision that we must have the ability to set laws that suit us to think that we might accept eu supervision on so called level playing field issues simply fails to see the point of what we are doing it is nt a simple negotiating position which might move under pressure it is the point of the whole project he said that is the reason there will be no extension to the transition period past the end of the year because at that point we recover our political and economic independence in full why would we want to postpone it the speech follows comments by french foreign minister jean yves le drian who predicted a bruising battle between the uk and eu on a post - brexit deal speaking at the annual munich security conference he made clear that brussels will defend its interests when negotiations begin next month i think that on trade issues and the mechanism for future relations which we are going to start on we are going to rip each other apart he said but that is part of negotiations everyone will defend their own interests le drian a close ally of president emmanuel macron is the latest senior eu figure to warn that the negotiations will be difficult mr frost added that the uk is seeking an open and fair arrangement with the eu based on free trade agreement fta precedents how would you feel if the uk demanded that to protect ourselves the eu dynamically harmonise with our national laws set in westminster and the decisions of our own regulators and courts the reason we expect for example open and fair competition provisions based on fta precedent is not that we want a minimalist outcome on competition laws it is that the model of an fta and the precedents contained in actual agreed ftas are the most appropriate ones for the relationship of sovereign entities in highly sensitive areas relating to how their jurisdictions are governed and how their populations give consent to that government european commission president ursula von der leyen and chief negotiator michel barnier have both cast doubt on boris johnson 's aim to reach a comprehensive agreement by the end of the year when the brexit transition period runs out robert peston on boris johnson 's hedge fund government boris johnson faces calls to sack controversial number 10 adviser budget date may be delayed by new chancellor grant shapps says the eu has repeatedly warned britain can not expect to enjoy continued high quality market access if it insists on diverging from eu social and environmental standards there is expected to be a particularly tough fight over fishing rights with the eu insisting continued access to uk waters must form part of any agreement mr johnson in turn has said the uk will act as an independent coastal state taking control of its own fisheries a number 10 spokesman said mr frost will reflect on the institution of the eu and look towards the new relationship we are seeking to build the spokesman added we want a relationship based on friendly co - operation between sovereign equals and we are not asking for anything special or bespoke he said we are seeking a deal that the eu has struck previously with other countries such as canada downing street said it was still seeking quota free tariff free arrangements even though canada 's deal does not eliminate all tariffs and quotas president donald trump took his presidential armoured limo known as the beast on parade lap to open the daytona 500 race in florida on sunday he and first lady melania treated the audience of nearly 100,000 to a flyover of air force one before riding round the famous race track with his security motorcade and race cars in tow but despite the grand welcome the race was eventually postponed following two lengthy rain delays trump looks to rattle democrats with new hampshire rally the battle of new hampshire multiple candidates gain the big mo president trump and melania take the beast around the daytona 500 the start of the race had already been pushed back to allow for mr trump 's grand entrance and drivers were recalled to the pits when rain broke out after his lap the race eventually got underway but after 20 laps a heavy downpour soaked the racing surface which takes hours to dry forcing organisers to postpone the event mr trump 's reelection team had planned to fly an aerial banner near the speedway and were to run an ad during the fox broadcast which was expected to reach millions he 's the second president to attend the race after george w bush who was also in his reelection year at the time after his scheduled return sunday evening to washington mr trump plans to take his reelection campaign to rallies scheduled for phoenix las vegas and colorado springs colorado downing street has refused to condemn comments made by a new adviser who once suggested the uptake of contraception to stop unplanned pregnancies creating a permanent underclass boris johnson is facing mounting pressure to sack new downing street adviser andrew sabisky who was drafted in after the pm 's chief adviser dominic cummings called for misfits and weirdos to apply for jobs in government mr sabisky reportedly once suggested that the benefits of a purported cognitive enhancer which can prove fatal are probably worth a dead kid once a year writing on mr cummings website in 2014 he said one way to get around the problems of unplanned pregnancies creating a permanent underclass would be to legally enforce universal uptake of long term contraception at the onset of puberty vaccination laws give it a precedent i would argue he also suggested black americans have a lower average iq than white americans downing street did not confirm or deny whether mr sabisky had been hired by number 10 saying it would not comment on individual appointments it repeatedly refused to say whether mr johnson supported the views expressed by mr sabisky on eugenics the selective breeding of humans or the iq of black people a number 10 spokesman said i 'm not going to be commenting on individual appointments the spokesman added the prime minister 's views on a range of subjects are well publicised and documented number 10 insiders insisted that mr johnson did not support eugenics but the prime minister has courted controversy with his views on iq in the past cabinet reshuffle the winners and losers robert peston on boris johnson 's hedge fund government in a speech in 2013 he said any discussion about equality had to take account of the fact that 16 % of our species had an iq below 85 while around 2 % had an iq above 130 adding the harder you shake the pack the easier it will be for some cornflakes to get to the top in 2000 while mr johnson was editor of the spectator the magazine carried an article from columnist taki which said on average orientals are slower to mature less randy less fertile and have larger brains and higher iq scores blacks are at the other pole and whites fall somewhere in the middle although closer to the orientals than the blacks labour party chairman ian lavery said it is disgusting that not only has number 10 failed to condemn andrew sabisky 's appalling comments but also seems to have endorsed the idea that white people are more intelligent than black people boris johnson should have the backbone to make a statement in his own words on why he has made this appointment whether he stands by it and his own views on the subject of eugenics ms sturgeon said these are really not acceptable headlines for any government to be generating or allowing to be generated labours shadow cabinet office minister jon trickett said there are really no words to describe boris johnsons appointment as one of his senior advisers a man who is on record as supporting the forced sterilisation of people he considers not worthy he must of course be removed from this position immediately geneticist dr adam rutherford also criticised the comments writing on twitter like cummings he appears to be bewitched by science without having made the effort to understand the areas he is invoking nor its history budget date may be delayed by new chancellor grant shapps says trump in fresh warning over huawei impact on intelligence sharing he said the moral repugnance of the remarks was overwhelming adding i am all for scientifically minded people advising government in fact i am all for scientists advising government from this perspective sabisky and indeed cummings look bewitched by science without doing the legwork instead this resembles the marshalling of misunderstood or specious science into a political ideology the history here is important because this process is exactly what happened at the birth of scientific racism and the birth of eugenics it is understood special advisers are prepared to boycott meetings where mr sabisky is present and refuse to reply to any emails he sends environment secretary george eustice said it was a matter for dominic cummings and number 10 when asked about the remarks on sky news on sunday transport secretary grant shapps told the bbc i do nt know the individual but they are particularly not views that i or the government shares in any way shape or form as you know i misspent much of the past 20 years trying to understand and report on the excesses of the city of london that led to the banking crisis and everything that followed there were two hedge fund managers who made a bundle out of the rise and fall chris hohn and patrick degorce i mention them because the new chancellor rishi sunak worked with and for both of them the reason this matters is that hohn and degorce were so focused relentless and masters of detail that they make dominic cummings seem like a soft dilettante it is little wonder therefore that sunak is thriving in what feels to me like the hedge fund culture that has taken hold at the centre of government since boris johnson and cummings took over this does not mean sunak will be cummings 's marionette even with the creation of the new joint downing street / treasury economic policy unit whose members will be chosen by cummings and sunak with none relying exclusively on sunak 's patronage but it absolutely does mean downing street the cabinet office and the treasury will act more or less as a seamless unit and the centre of government will be more powerful than at any time probably since the second world war more fool any minister who dares to gainsay the troika of cummings gove and sunak with johnson floating zen like above cabinet minister plays down fears tv licence fee could be axed trump 's new warning over huawei impact on intelligence sharing with the sackings of smith leadsom and cox and the resignation of javid johnson demonstrated more than any modern pm that the reward of dissent is exile to the salt mines of the backbenches collective cabinet responsibility now means not a frank discussion between equals with pm primus inter pares but the prime minister 's way or the highway the cabinet is the politburo for execution of the supreme leader 's ordinance to level up the midlands and north or else the problem is that few ministers have much of a clue absent debate how on earth they are going to narrow the opportunity income and wealth gap between north and south it remains a worthy ambition without a practical plan as for the status and integrity of the treasury it will survive this storm as it has survived many before the treasury has a collective memory and a mission to stop the uk going bust lacked by any other arm of government it also perhaps surprisingly still contains many talented and dedicated officials but javid 's departure means that fiscal rules designed to make sure the exchequer has the resources to cope with the next economic shock have been downgraded from the framework into which all spending and tax policy must fit into a heuristic a rule of thumb all fiscal rules have from time immemorial been honoured in the breach but those written into the tories ' election manifesto already vague because there was no target date for hitting balance on current spending though the assumption was that it was a rolling three year target will now be gamed by the political hedge fund that central government has become johnson and cummings are hellbent on turning their decisive election victory into economic and political boom before the bust that they know can never be escaped donald trump has stepped up his warning that the us could withdraw intelligence co - operation from countries such as the uk which allow chinese firm huawei into their 5 g networks the us president told one of his ambassadors that any nation who chooses to use an untrustworthy 5 g vendor will jeopardise our ability to share intelligence and information at the highest level the chinese telecoms firm is regarded as a high risk vendor by the uk but is being allowed to play a limited role in the countrys 5 g infrastructure us vice president mike pence indicates huawei decision could jeopardise uk trade talks boris johnson appoints new us ambassador amid donald trump fury over huawei mr trump was reportedly furious at the uks decision which came after sustained pressure from washington on its allies not to use huawei because of its links to the beijing government the telecoms firm has repeatedly denied claims that it presents a security risk to the west with germany considering its position on huawei mr trump phoned his ambassador in berlin from the presidential air force one jet to issue a warning about the use of the firm ambassador richard grenell said the president just called me from af1 and instructed me to make clear that any nation who chooses to use an untrustworthy 5 g vendor will jeopardise our ability to share intelligence and information at the highest level in january the uk gave the green light to huawei to play a restricted part in the 5 g network with prime minister boris johnson insisting it could be done without jeopardising intelligence co - operation with the us and the other members of the five eyes alliance canada australia and new zealand pm 's decision on huawei is infuriating the us the government has acknowledged that huawei is not a trusted supplier but argues that by banning it from the most sensitive elements of the network and restricting its involvement to 35 % on the periphery it can manage the risk analysis by the national cyber security centre said that if the chinese state wanted to carry out a major cyber attack there were easier ways to do it than placing backdoors in huawei equipment new chancellor rishi sunak who took over the role from sajid javid may delay the date of next month 's budget in order to give himself more time to prepare a senior minister has said transport secretary grant shapps said ministers had still not been told whether the budget would go ahead on march 11 as planned after sajid javids resignation i know that the budget plans are well advanced but i also know that rishi sunak the new chancellor may want time mr shapps told sky newss sophy ridge on sunday programme i have nt heard whether the date of march is confirmed as yet he is probably looking at it i should think this week cabinet reshuffle sajid javid says he had no option but to resign devolved finance ministers write to treasury seeking budget talks johnson chairs first cabinet after ministers leave in dramatic reshuffle also on sunday mr shapps told bbc1s the andrew marr show the guy 's only been in place for a few days let 's give him a few days to decide on the date mr sunak previously the treasury chief secretary was catapulted into the top job after mr javid dramatically resigned in last weeks cabinet reshuffle it followed a series of well publicised clashes between mr javid and boris johnsons chief adviser dominic cummings who was reportedly pressing for the treasury to relax constraints on public spending and to replace all of mr javid 's political advisers the former chancellor said he was left with no option but to resign as he was not prepared to replace all his staff sajid javid resignation a power struggle about policy as well as control the battle of downing street can anyone challenge the prime minister who is new chancellor rishi sunak mr shapps however denied that mr cummings was now all powerful in whitehall he pointed to last weeks decision to give the go ahead to the hs2 high speed rail link a project mr cummings was known to oppose it is not the case that things necessarily go dominic cummings way or anyone elses he said take hs2 a big decision that dominic had views about i had views about we discussed it we discussed our various views and we came to a conclusion the idea that just because dominic thinks something that s what happen is clearly not the case speaking on bbc1s the andrew marr show mr shapps said the government was determined to deliver a big uplift for infrastructure spending at the same time he said they would be sticking to their manifesto pledge to get debt down over the course of the parliament our manifesto commitments are our commitments we absolutely intend to stick to the manifesto commitments for the rest of it you will need to wait to the budget he said the cost to britains sovereignty could be higher than we ever imagined if beijings state owned railway builder is given a role in constructing the troubled hs2 high speed link a tory mp said britain is in talks with china about the project and the china railway construction corporation crcc has said it can build the line in just five years at a much lower cost than is currently forecast according to the financial times department for transport dft officials confirmed preliminary discussions had taken place between crcc and hs2 ltd but said no concrete commitments had been made the dft is always keen to learn from the experience of others and to consider approaches that offer value for money to the taxpayer one official said tory mp tom tugendhat chairman of the commons foreign affairs committee told the pa news agency britain needs to think hard about how we partner with countries that do nt share our respect for human rights or the rule of law the price of the project may be lower but the cost to our sovereignty could be higher than we ever imagined there s no point in taking back control from brussels only to hand it over to beijing mr tugendhat earlier told the bbc radio 4 today programme that the uk is in dire need of a proper china strategy adding we are being offered at extraordinarily generous terms it appears everything to connect our telephone networks to connect our cities and to connect our power networks what is it that we want out of china have we decided to take back control from brussels just to hand it over to beijing the idea that we should allow others to act like we did in places like india and nigeria for the best part of 200 years here in the uk would be extremely questionable hs2 what does it mean for me mr tugendhat who was an outspoken critic of the governments decision to allow the chinese tech giant huawei a role in building the uks 5 g network questioned crccs claim it could build the entire line in just five years the reason why chinese projects in china are very often so quick is because they do nt worry about such minor matters as planning consent or workers rights he said it seems extremely unlikely that without really short cutting any number of labour conditions that it would be possible boris johnson this week controversially gave the green light for the scheme to go ahead despite an official review warning costs could reach over 100 billion against a budget of 62 billion under current plans the final stretch of the line is not due to be completed until 2040 although mr johnson has said he wants that brought forward to 2035 how hs2 got here today and key dates in project 's history however the ft reported that crcc had written to hs2 ltds chief executive last month saying it could build the line by the middle of the decade for a much reduced price tag the letter first reported by building magazine and seen by the ft states we are certain that we can offer a cost that is significantly lower than the projections we have seen the advantages are too great in our opinion too great to dismiss on the basis that there are obstacles to overcome you will find that the chinese way is to seek solutions not linger on obstacles and difficulties crcc has transformed chinas transport system building most of the countrys 15,500-mile high speed network however british officials are said to be sceptical that it could operate in the same way in a democracy with property rights protected landscapes and powerful lobbying groups any move to give beijing a further role in the uks infrastructure would almost certainly prove controversial after mr johnson reportedly incurred the wrath of us president donald trump as well as upsetting many tory mps with his decision to allow tech giant huawei to supply equipment for the 5 g mobile network ruthless smugglers who traffic people into the uk are not going to give up and more migrants are likely to die as a result a former head of border force has said gangs are harvesting tens of thousands of pounds from vulnerable migrants in far = off countries and promising them entry to mainland europe and the uk on the french coastline organised crime groups watch the weather ready to send a small armada of migrant boats across the freezing english channel while others lives are put at risk in lorries and containers speaking exclusively to the pa news agency ex - border force director general tony smith cbe said he fears more channel drownings and a repeat of the essex container tragedy that killed 39 vietnamese citizens 102 migrants attempt channel crossing a day after another 90 were picked up he said the use of these riskier smuggling methods is a product of border forces success over the years in cracking down on traditional routes like airlines and passenger ferries mr smith told pa we have been playing this continuous game of cat and mouse with the smugglers for a number of years now during his time at the agency mr smith saw the tactics used to smuggle migrants into the uk change many times when uk and french authorities closed one route another would pop up passport checks on britain bound flights at departure airports uk border controls in calais and increased security at french ports have all served to stymie once popular smuggling routes mr smith said these boat crossings started in 2018 as a sort of alternative measure to try and get people here in some ways we were the victims of our own success this was the next big thing mr smith who now works for border security consultancy fortinus global after leaving border force in 2013 said it remains relatively easy to smuggle people into the eu he said the supply chain begins in asia where donkeys or couriers go round villages promising that they can get people to europe if they can pay a sum like 10,000 either up front or after they arrive it is nt uncommon to find that people were recruited by smuggling gangs in their own backyard and offered passage once inside the eu the lack of border controls means migrants can move all the way to the french coastline where they are then loaded on to inflatable dinghies and sent out into the treacherous english channel every now and then you have a break in the weather and there are people over in france so they are looking at the weather they are looking at where we are where the french are we may suddenly see a small armada turning up often the boats need only get into british waters before calling 999 for the coastguard mr smith said as they will be taken to the uk where their asylum claims can be processed in this situation the preservation of life is paramount he added over two days last week 192 migrants were picked up trying to cross the busy waters of the english channel mr smith said we have done more recently than we ever have done to disrupt the gangs the problem is the supply chain is not going to go away while there is still a pull factor the uk is very attractive he said that unless the uk stopped observing international asylum law and instead started taking all migrants back to europe this is likely to continue smugglers are not going to give up people are going to die i would not at all be surprised if we saw more deaths in containers and also more drownings in the dover straits its just a miserable business in october police discovered the bodies of 39 vietnamese nationals in a refrigerated container in essex mr smith said this tragedy demonstrates how difficult it is to police the contents in containers he gave the example of the port of felixstowe where thousands of containers are docked every day we are not in a position to scan all of those containers asked about deaths in containers like what happened in essex mr smith said i am very worried there will be more bella sankey director of detention action called for a global britain to provide safe and legal routes for those seeking asylum she told pa by shutting down ordinary routes for people to seek asylum in the uk it has encouraged ever more dangerous smuggling operations that become a last resort for those desperate enough to put themselves in smugglers hands a global britain would provide safe and legal routes

dominic cummings speaking on thursday former chancellor sajid javid said any self respecting minister would reject number 10 's conditions in august mr cummings fired mr javids aide sonia khan and it

relationship between the prime minister and chancellor is an integral part of any government when it works they look powerful when it does n't the government can look dysfunctional reports emerged earlier this week of a rift between mr javid and the prime minister 's chief adviser dominic cummings cabinet reshuffle sajid javid says he had no option but to resign why has sajid javid quit as chancellor in a row over his closest aides asks robert peston mr javid downplayed the rumours saying people should n't believe everything they read but mr javid 's resignation as chancellor due to his reluctance to sack his political advisers has raised the question has number 10 now got too much power until now the chancellor has had his own team of special advisers as well as the vast treasury apparatus at his disposal this is now being replaced with an integrated number 10-treasury team of advisers at the top of that structure in theory they will report to both the new chancellor and the prime minister in effect the prime minister and his chief advisor dominic cummings will ultimately be in charge dominic cummings appears to have won his battle with the former chancellor will rishi sunak or anyone now be able to challenge the prime minister the departure of sajid javid as chancellor is the consequence of a power struggle between number 10 and number 11 that much is obvious but what were the disagreements about control without question personality clashes almost certainly played their part but fundamental differences over policy feel like they are also at the heart of this falling out boris johnson insisted on the dismissal of javids advisory team precisely because he did nt like the advice they were giving him cabinet reshuffle sajid javid says he had no option but to resign why has sajid javid quit as chancellor in a row over his closest aides asks robert peston in four weeks time on march 11 the government is set to deliver its first budget since winning the election its a time to be bold a moment to begin the process of delivering on the promises made during the campaign boris johnsons instinct and that of dominic cummings is to spend the government plans to unleash a fiscal stimulus to boost the economy but sajid javids fiscal rules are making that difficult javid designed his rules as a public declaration of prudence a pledge to spend thoughtfully and responsibly sajid javid explains the reasons behind his resignation as chancellor he had to fight to get them included in the manifesto but eventually the conservatives pledged not to borrow money to fund day to day spending and to balance the current budget by 2023 these commitments mean that the government now finds itself constrained the forecasts for economic growth are weak and there is nt much room to spend without raising taxes stories have started to appear in the press about potential tax rises particularly on wealthier households a mansion tax a cut to pensions tax relief for high earners tighter rules on capital gains tax javid seemed to be nervous about the idea of implementing all or indeed any of them i m a low tax person i want to keep taxes as low as possible he insisted when i interviewed him in birmingham two days ago i admire people who have worked hard and achieved financial security the pound jumped on the back of news of javids resignation investors suspect that his fiscal rules may follow him out of the door in the months to come hemmed in by a set of rules they were never keen on faced with the need for tax rises to fund their spending ambitions it may be that boris johnson and his team decided it was time for a change words by itv news westminster producer lewis denison boris johnson has carried out his first major cabinet reshuffle since his resounding win in the december general election the biggest bombshell of the day was sajid javid 's resignation but that followed the surprise purge of several senior tories high profile women lost their jobs with theresa villiers andrea leadsom and esther mcvey all being sacked aside from mr javid 's resignation the next biggest shock was the sacking of northern ireland

touted for the top since his arrival in parliament five years ago taking william hagues richmond yorkshire seat after the former conservative party leader decided to stand down at the 2015 general election mr sunak was quick to establish himself as a free thinker the brexiteer in 2016 produced a report on the merits of introducing free ports after leaving the european union a tax break concept that prime minister boris johnson cherry picked for his own leadership campaign mr sunaks decision along with high flying colleagues oliver dowden and robert jenrick to jointly back mr johnson during the summer leadership contest was seen as a major win for the former london mayors campaign proving he had the young blood of the party on board sajid javid resigns as chancellor in huge cabinet reshuffle shock why has a row over his aides led to javid quitting as chancellor the trio wrote at the time beyond brexit boris johnson is one of lifes optimists and can help us recapture a sense of excitement and hope about what we conservatives can do for britain the pm was quick to reward mr sunaks loyalty making him chief secretary to the treasury after entering downing street in july the level of trust placed in the oxford university graduate was further demonstrated after sajid javid turned down the job of chancellor in the pms first post - brexit reshuffle of his cabinet it was mr sunak who was given the nod and promoted to one of the great offices of state in mr javids stead on thursday at the age of 39 he misses out on being the youngest chancellor of the past century by just

keeping fit playing cricket and football and watching films as a hindu he takes his commons oath on the bhagavad gita a sacred sanskrit text why has sajid javid quit as chancellor because he wanted his political advisers to be his own courtiers and servants as is the tradition and not those of dominic cummings the prime ministers chief aide to the contrary johnson agreed with cummings that javids current special advisers should be dismissed and replaced with new advisers who would answer and report to cummings the pm and cummings believe the success of the government in these challenging times require downing st and the treasury to act as far as possible as one seamless unit sajid javid resigns as chancellor in huge cabinet reshuffle shock according to one of johnsons close colleagues the current prime minister admires how cameron and osborne acted as a two headed single political monster when prime minister and chancellor but javid took the stripping from him of control of his aides as too great an undermining of his authority so javid sacked himself and his deputy rishi sunak who cummings and johnson trust completely has replaced javid this was not a drive by shooting by cummings and johnson to quote the goodwin aphorism but they are not naive and they always knew there was a risk he would throw himself under the boris bus video report by itv news

correspondent richard pallot labour has formally written to the parliamentary commissioner for standards calling for an investigation into who paid for boris johnsons 15,000 trip to the caribbean the prime minister claimed in the commons ' register of members ' interests that the holiday was paid for by tory donor david ross but a spokesperson for the carphone warehouse co - founder denied mr ross fronted up any cash for the villa instead saying that it was a benefit in kind mr ross facilitated accommodation for mr johnson on mustique valued at 15,000 the spokesperson said therefore this is a benefit in kind from mr ross to mr johnson and mr johnson 's declaration to the house of commons is correct despite the clarification shadow cabinet office minister jon trickett penned a letter to kathryn stone requesting she look into details of boris johnsons luxury holiday which took place over the new year the senior opposition mp said he remained dissatisfied with the explanations provided by downing street cabinet reshuffle pm wields axe in purge of senior tories corbyn brings up pm 's past in latest row over jamaica deportations in his letter to the commissioner mr trickett said the code of conduct requires members to provide the name of the person or organisation that actually funded a donation the evidence now suggests it was not david ross the entry made by the prime minister therefore appears to be incorrect mr trickett said the public should know whether the pm knowingly make a false entry into the register labour earlier said mr johnson should face a parliamentary investigation unless he revealed who paid for the trip in a declaration published on wednesday mr johnson announced in the mps ' register that he had accepted accommodation for a private holiday for my partner and me value 15,000 the private holiday lasted from december 26 to january 5 according to the entry in the register and named mr ross as the financial provider mr ross earlier told the daily mail the former london mayor had asked him for help finding accommodation on the island of mustique where he and his girlfriend reportedly stayed but that he had not provided the villa a spokesperson for the grimsby born businessman reportedly worth more than 650 million told the newspaper boris johnson did not stay in david ross 's house boris wanted some help to find somewhere in mustique david called the company who run all the villas and somebody had dropped out so boris got the use of a villa that was worth 15,000 but david ross did not pay any monies whatsoever for this mr tricket said it was crucial for the prime minister 's finances to be transparent and urged the commissioner to investigate the pm ttransparency is crucial to ensuring the public have confidence that elected members of this house have not been unduly influenced by any donations or gifts that they may receive boris johnson urges uk to remain confident and calm amid coronavirus threat for this reason i request that you to investigate whether the prime minister has followed all transparency requirements when registering the donation a downing street source said much of what was being alleged by mr trickett had been made out of date by the updated statement by mr ross spokesman what is being said in the letter has been covered off by additional statements made by david ross spokesman the source told the pa news agency the holiday provided mr johnson with a break after the election campaign which produced a conservative landslide for the first time since the 1980s a number 10 spokesperson said all transparency requirements have been followed as set out in the register of members ' financial interests mr johnson was criticised during the holiday for not cutting it short following the break out of international tensions when the us killed iranian general qassem soleimani on january 3 shadow foreign secretary emily thornberry accused mr johnson of sunning himself while leaving cabinet secretary mark sedwill to chair three emergency cobra meetings about the assassination outgoing culture secretary baroness morgan told peston she would like to see the non - payment of the bbc licence fee decriminalised speaking to robert peston baroness morgan said the way people consume media is changing and that it might be more suitable to launch civil proceedings against those who did not pay the licence fee baroness morgan told peston the broadcasting landscape has changed even in the five years since the last review is it right that we criminalise people for not buying a licence fee when we do n't criminalise people for not paying other bills we 're not saying there should n't be sanctions but you could have a civil sanction when pressed by peston about what form of punishment those who do n't pay the fine could face baroness morgan added the sanction would be that you would end up going to the courts going through a civil procedure potentially to enforce the non - payment of a fine diminished bbc would weaken uk chairman warns bbc needs to remain relevant or face being left behind culture secretary says of course the other big change that 's happened is that from may of this year those who are over-75 not on pension credit will be paying the licence fee as well and we actually know that of course it 's often women who will find they are the ones who will fall foul of the system critics argue that if the licence fee was scrapped there would be less money for the bbc to put on television programmes and would reduce its revenue speaking of that criticism she said there 's a broader debate to be had about the licence fee and the way young people consume news let 's have that debate baroness morgan will resign from her role as culture secretary on thursday as part of a much anticipated cabinet reshuffle under current regulations a licence is required if you watch or record programmes shown on the bbc or downloaded from bbc programmes on iplayer the current cost is 154.50 but is set to rise to 157.50 from april this year other guests on peston include len mccluskey jeremy hunt rosena allin khan and baroness warsi boris johnson will promote a generation of talent in a reshuffle aimed at preparing the tories for the future cabinet ministers who fear for their jobs are braced for a brutal process although it is in the lower ranks of the government where the biggest changes are expected as the prime minister seeks to promote female mps in a sign that the tories are preparing for a lengthy period in government mr johnson wants to give ministerial experience to a range of women who could be promoted to the cabinet in future reshuffles there is not expected to be a reduction in the number of female members of the cabinet even though baroness morgan has already said she intends to leave her ministerial role and the positions of andrea leadsom and theresa villiers are thought to be vulnerable female mps in line for promotion during the reshuffle process include defence minister anne marie trevelyan former brexit minister suella braverman and gillian keegan alok sharma is expected to be promoted from his current cabinet post at international development while paymaster general oliver dowden who attends cabinet is also in line for a bigger job a no 10 source said the prime minister wants this reshuffle to set the foundations for government now and in the future he wants to promote a generation of talent that will be promoted further in the coming years he will reward those mps who have worked hard to deliver on this governments priorities to level up the whole country and deliver the change people voted for last year the most junior ministerial rank parliamentary under secretary of state level is likely to have a 50 - 50 gender split after the reshuffle by the summer mr johnson also aims to ensure that at least 60 % of ministerial aides the parliamentary private secretaries will be women up from 18 % at present other factors at play in this reshuffle include filling the vacant role in charge of the cop26 un climate summit following the sacking of claire oneill and deciding whether steve barclay will return to government after the brexit department was scrapped following the january 31 departure from the european union corbyn brings up pm 's past in latest row over jamaica deportations boris johnson urges uk to remain confident and calm amid coronavirus threat senior ministers including chancellor sajid javid home secretary priti patel and foreign secretary dominic raab are expected to remain in place while downing street has confirmed that grant shapps will stay on as transport secretary mr johnsons senior aide dominic cummings had reportedly been seeking a wider cull of ministers and a shake up of whitehall departments but no 10 insiders believe a more conventional reshuffle will be carried out by the prime minister on the eve of the changes ben wallace and geoffrey cox both viewed as under threat set out why they should stay in office defence secretary mr wallace said i have been in this game long enough to know that british cabinet reshuffles are brutal it is at the decision of the prime minister who serves in his cabinet i have been there before i have been in quite a long time i m keen to serve i enjoy the job as defence secretary i m a veteran i m a northern mp i was actually in the army so i think all of those hopefully qualify me but who knows attorney general mr cox said he would eagerly embrace the opportunity to continue in his post if spared by the pm have i had enough of the job let me make plain absolutely not this has been one of the greatest in fact the greatest honour of my professional life he said but the high flying lawyer added if you gave me the opportunity to continue i would embrace it eagerly but equally if it is not to be well then there are other doorways that will open for me jeremy corbyn has suggested boris johnson could have been deported to the us because he dabbled in class a drugs and conspired to beat up a journalist when he was younger as he questioned the government 's decision to deport foreign criminals to jamaica there was furious reaction from tory benches when the labour leader asked if there was one rule for young black boys from the caribbean and another for white boys from the united states mr corbyn referring to a flight which took 17 convicted criminals to jamaica on tuesday said the deportation showed the government had learned absolutely nothing from the windrush scandal mr johnson who was born in new york hit back saying mr corbyn had conflated the windrush generation with what he described as foreign national offenders the government says it is legally obliged to order the deportation of foreign criminals who had received sentences of 12 months or more in prison but campaigners say some of those due on the flight were sentenced for one time drug offences when they were young and came to the uk when they were children some 33 people due to be deported were spared after a last minute legal battle between the government and human rights campaigners jamaica deportation flight leaves but without some detainees after court ruling on tuesday ministers including home secretary priti patel defended the deportation saying those on the flight were foreign criminals who committed serious offences but campaigners supported by more than 170 mps say many on the flight are british in every meaningful way speaking at prime minister 's questions mr corbyn asked mr johnson if he thought a person who entered the uk aged five and was the victim of county lines grooming and compelled to carry drugs released five years ago and never re - offended deserves to be deported mr johnson replied i think the whole country would agree that while i can not comment on individual cases it is entirely right that foreign national offenders should be deported from this country in accordance with the law mr corbyn said the government was misleading the public by claiming all those on the flight were serious offenders home office is to start making windrush payments under compensation scheme windrush generation to be commemorated with memorial at waterloo station hostile windrush environment can be traced back to post - ww2 governments to groans from the tory benches mr corbyn added if there was a case of a young white boy with blonde hair who later dabbled in class a drugs and conspired with a friend to beat up a journalist would he deport that boy or is it one rule for young black boys from the caribbean and another for white boys from the united states mr johnson fired back mr corbyn demeans himself and by the way besmirches the reputation of the windrush generation who came to this country to work in our public services to teach our children in this country to make lives better for people in this country he has no right to conflate them with those foreign national offenders that we are deporting today members of the windrush generation came to the uk from caribbean countries many on the boat hms empire windrush and were given a legal right to work in the uk following world war ii the windrush scandal relates to those who were wrongly detained denied legal rights threatened with deportation and wrongly deported from the uk by the home office mr corbyn 's remark about a young white boy with blonde hair who later dabbled in class a drugs is reference to comments american born mr johnson has made regarding cocaine when being interviewed by janet street porter for marie claire magazine mr johnson confessed to taking drugs when he was a teenager when asked about taking cocaine he replied well that was when i was 19 it all goes to show that sometimes its better not to say anything i thoroughly disagree with drugs i do nt want my kids having drugs he was being asked about an appearance on panel show have i got news for you in 2005 in which he said i think i was once given cocaine but i sneezed and so it did not go up my nose in fact i may have been doing icing sugar momentum the big mo as george h bush called it is the key prize from this first in the nation primary election winning in new hampshire is meant to provide the slingshot to get a presidential candidate into orbit for bernie sanders tuesday night was indeed a precious hard fought victory one that he hopes propels him to the democratic nomination and ultimately the white house his supporters are mostly young and seeking radical change and they spoke of this as a first step to the presidency and to major reform across america but this win was not exactly convincing especially since senator sanders is from neighbouring vermont and performed far more impressively four years ago so somehow this was both a victory and a stumble at the same time its that sort of election surging last night was amy klobuchar the senator from minnesota she will now benefit from being the surprise package of new hampshire with all the momentum and fundraising potential that brings and there was yet another victor last night do nt ask me how an election can have three winners but that s 2020 for you democrat front runners buttigieg and sanders defend themselves in debate attacks pete buttigieg also sustained his improbable campaign with a strong second place his message of generational change caught fire again just as it did in iowa last week he s only 38 years old and the audacity of a former mayor running for the presidency of the us is quite something to behold so the story of this fascinating night is that there are possibly six tickets out of new hampshire for democratic contenders that s how many candidates remain viable going forward bernie sanders was boosted by winning pete buttigieg came in a close second amy klobuchar was the surprise of the night elizabeth warren retains strong support elsewhere joe biden believes he can do well in south carolina and michael bloomberg is waiting in the wings with his billions democratic party head calls for re - canvass of iowa results after delays so we can say this with confidence the battle for the democratic nomination has just begun now the campaigns move on from snowy new england to the deep south and the american west what a race it will be a contest for the soul of a disorientated and shell shocked party split along gender ideological and generational lines new hampshire normally narrows the field this year it seems to have thrown out multiple lifelines

completed the journey to hs2 's final stop will likely include plenty more debate after boris johnson gave the green light to the project here 's how hs2 's eventful led to today 's breakthrough robert peston is boris johnson rewarding or betraying the north with hs2 january 2009 labour establishes hs2 ltd to examine the case for a new high speed rail line december 2010 a consultation on a route for hs2 from london to birmingham with a y shaped section to manchester and leeds is published by the conservative liberal democrat coalition january 2012 transport secretary justine greening

kirby resigns as hs2 ltd chief executive february 2017 the high speed rail london west midlands bill achieves royal assent enabling preparation work to begin july 2017 hs2 ltd accepts it was a serious error to make 1.76 million of unauthorised redundancy payments to staff december 2018 sir terry morgan resigns as chairman of hs2 ltd amid criticism over his role as chairman of crossrail which is delayed and over budget august 2019 the conservatives commission a review into whether and how hs2 should continue it will be led by former hs2 ltd chairman douglas oakervee with long term critic of the project lord berkeley acting as his deputy september 2019 a report by hs2 ltd chairman allan cook says the railway may not be completed until 2040 and the scheme could cost 88 billion january 2020 the oakervee review is widely leaked it finds that hs2 could cost up to 106 billion but concludes on balance that the project should continue december 2026 high speed trains between london and birmingham were due to begin running by this date but hs2 ltd admits this is not viable 2027 phase 2a from birmingham to crewe was due to open this year but that is also subject to delay 2033 hs2 was due to be completed by this point with phase 2b running from crewe to manchester and birmingham to leeds video report by itv news consumer editor chris choi boris johnson has thrown his weight behind controversial hs2 plans that could shuttle passengers from london to birmingham in 45 minutes on 225 mph trains mr johnson said in the house of commons on tuesday this country is being held back by its infrastructure as he approved phase 1 between london and birmingham the next phase would connect to manchester and leeds the projects initial budget was 32.7 billion at 2011 prices but a leaked review by douglas oakervee last year found it could cost up to 106 billion despite poor management the prime minister said he believes in the fundamental value of hs2 robert peston is boris johnson rewarding or betraying the north with hs2 hs2 11 key questions on the cross - country rail link answered he told mps when it comes to advocating hs2 it must be said that the task is not made easier by hs2 ltd the company concerned speaking as an mp whose constituency is on the route i can not say that hs2 ltd has distinguished itself in the handling of local communities he added but poor management to date has not detracted in my view from the fundamental value of the project he defended his decision to continue the project saying everybody always tries to stop big infrastructure projects at round about this moment the treasury if they had got their way would have stopped the m25 the treasury would never have allowed the channel tunnel to go ahead hs2 actually has a better business case today than the m25 had he added i remember when i was mayor of london they tried to stop crossrail mr johnson also confirmed intentions to run further than birmingham and to manchester in leeds in what would be phase 2 he said this is not just about getting from london to birmingham and back this is about finally making a rapid connection from the west midlands to the northern powerhouse to liverpool to manchester to leeds and simultaneously permitting us to go forward with northern powerhouse rail across the pennines finally giving the home of the railways the fast connections they need and none of that none of it makes any sense without hs2 how hs2 got here today and key dates in project 's history to oversee the project mr johnson said he will appoint a minister along with a ministerial oversight group that will be tasked with making strategic decisions about it high speed trains would also run beyond the new lines on existing tracks as far as edinburgh and glasgow trains serving newcastle and edinburgh could stretch to 400 metres the length of nearly four football pitches hs2 ltd the government owned company responsible for developing and building the railway says it will boost capacity and cut journey times mr johnson 's announcement came as the government pledged a 5 billion cash injection to overhaul bus and cycle links in english regions outside london why are there concerns over the project former hs2 ltd chairman douglas oakervee was commissioned by the government in august 2019 to lead a review into whether or not the programme should be scrapped amid rising costs and delays it has been widely leaked that the review found hs2 's cost could hit 106 billion but concluded that on balance it should continue mr johnson also said in the commons the review recently conducted by douglas oakervee leaves no doubt of the clinching case for high speed rail a vast increase in capacity with hundreds of thousands of extra seats making it much easier for travellers to move up and down our long narrow country and that means faster journey times not just more capacity it was due to open in december 2026 but hs2 ltd chairman allan cook said last year it would be prudent to plan for an opening between 2028 and 2031 jeremy corbyn says he fears nothing has changed last month whitehall 's spending watchdog said the scheme is over budget and behind schedule because its complexity and risks were under estimated the national audit office warned that it is impossible to estimate with certainty what the final cost could be the wildlife trust has a longstanding opposition to the project which it says will cause a vast scale of destruction to nature nikki williams the trust 's director of campaigns and policy said in response to mr johnson 's speech nature is paying too high a price for hs2 he added it is vital that hs2 does not devastate or destroy irreplaceable meadows ancient woodlands and internationally important wetlands that are home to a huge range of wildlife from barn owls to butterflies green and sustainable transport is vital but the climate emergency will not be solved by making the nature crisis worse itv news reporter stacey foster speaks to residents in kenilworth boris johnson is set to announce a 5 billion cash injection to overhaul bus and cycle links in english regions outside london the prime minister will say the five year funding package will provide more frequent services and simpler more affordable fares it will also allow for new priority bus routes and the purchase of at least 4,000 zero emission buses in england and wales details of the planned cash boost are expected to be set out in a commons statement on tuesday in which mr johnson is expected to confirm the hs2 high speed rail link is to go ahead despite concerns about the costs and the impact of the environment boris johnson to confirm hs2 will go ahead robert peston is boris johnson rewarding or betraying the north with hs2 chancellor sajid javid set to back controversial hs2 rail project the move will be seen as a sop to placate tory mps critical of hs2 who have argued the money would be better spent on improving local transport links in the north and the midlands as well improving bus services mr johnson will promise 250 miles of new cycle routes across england with dozens of mini - holland schemes to make town centres safer for cyclists ahead of the announcement mr johnson said local transport connections have a truly transformative role to play in levelling up infrastructure across the country our daily journeys for work or leisure are about so much more than just getting from a to b they are the key to accessing skilled jobs and opportunities boosting businesses and unlocking economic growth for towns cities and regions across this country that s why improving connectivity by overhauling bus services and making cycling easier than ever is such an important step forward to make sure every community has the foundations it needs to thrive for labour shadow transport secretary andy mcdonald said the measures would not reverse the damage done by years of conservative cuts after years of under investment and cuts this unambitious announcement is nowhere near enough to make the difference that transport users our economy or our environment need he said the conservatives are refusing to reverse their colossal 645 million a year cuts to bus budgets which have caused thousands of routes to be axed and fares to soar boris johnson has given his backing to hs2 despite some key questions raising some uncertain or at least controversial answers it is widely believed the project will come at a bigger price than initially forecast and trains will likely set off for the first time later than expected with at least another decade or two to go until hs2 is completed questions will continue to be asked for years to come here are 11 key questions about the much discussed high speed rail project robert peston is boris johnson rewarding or betraying the north with hs2 what was its original expected cost the projects initial budget was 32.7 billion at 2011 prices in 2015 it was allocated 56 billion what is the latest estimate a widely leaked review by douglas oakervee found it could cost up to 106 billion what about the schedule the first phase between london and birmingham was due to open in 2026 but hs2 ltd chairman allan cook said last year it would be more prudent to open between 2028 and 2031 how hs2 got here today and key dates in project 's history how much money has already been spent hs2 ltd has spent around 8 billion the money has gone towards the purchase of land and property ground investigation work technical designs it systems wages and public engagement what has gone wrong whitehall spending watchdog the national audit office found that the project is over budget and behind schedule because its complexity and risks were under estimated by the department for transport and hs2 ltd. why is it so expensive there are several reasons why hs2 is costing so much the railway will sit on concrete slab track which is more robust than traditional ballast but comes at a higher cost putting the line below ground into tunnels and cuttings at several locations reduces the impact on surrounding areas but is more expensive buying property on the route is also incredibly costly what are the benefits of hs2 one of the main benefits of hs2 will be the increase in capacity it will provide to britains railways hs2 ltd says the high speed trains will carry more than 300,000 passengers a day but they will also create space for more services on existing routes such as the west coast main line how about speed hs2 trains will operate at up to 225 mph reducing journey times examples given by hs2 ltd include manchester london journey times cut from two hours and seven minutes to one hour and seven minutes and birmingham london trips reduced from one hour and 22 minutes to 45 minutes what is the planned route phase 1 is planned to run between london and birmingham current designs involve a second y shaped phase launching in two stages phase 2a from the west midlands to crewe followed by phase 2b from crewe to manchester and birmingham to leeds who wants hs2 political leaders in northern england and business groups claim the railway is vital to boost transport links across the region providing increased capacity on an overcrowded network construction firms warn that scrapping hs2 would cause major damage to the industry who opposes it environmental groups claim construction work will devastate many natural habitats communities living on or near the route particularly in the chilterns are angry at the impact the railway will have on their lives other critics say the project is too expensive and the money should be used to boost existing transport networks if you thought boris johnsons and dominic cummingss culture war against the so called london elite had ended with his decisive election victory that it was simply a useful campaigning trope you may have to rethink because johnsons chief aide cumming reinforced the governments excoriation of media and lawyers when addressing downing street officials this morning in the words of one official present cummings described last nights court of appeal suspension of the deportation of criminals to the caribbean as a perfect symbol of the british states dysfunction he said there must be urgent action on the farce that judicial review has become jamaica deportation flight leaves but without some detainees after court ruling robert peston is boris johnson rewarding or betraying the north with hs2 boris johnson to confirm hs2 will go ahead the tory manifesto promised a review of the judicial review process a pledge that has unsettled some in the legal profession cummings said to officials that the support for the court ruling among mps and hacks shows they still have nt understood what the last few years has been about the country outside london is horrified but rich london is cheering the lawyers the court of appeal was persuaded that some of those who were being deported may not have been able to defend themselves because they may not have been able to use their mobile phones due to a malfunctioning mast words by itv news westminster producer lewis denison london mayoral candidate rory stewart is urging people to invite him round for sleepovers as part of his plan to win election the former tory leadership hopeful who is running as an independent posted a video to twitter in which he asked londoners to invite him into their homes and show me the city through their eyes he admitted it 's a weird request from a politician but claimed the way mayors get to know their cities is by literally walking through every one of the 32 boroughs he said being in other people 's shoes seeing through their eyes staying in their houses will help him learn people 's concerns and ideas so please he said in the video have me to stay with your family or just in your home seeing your borough he even promised to bring a sleeping bag and a box of chocolates he shared a link to a sign up page for those interested in having him stay which asks them to fill in their contact details rory stewart diplomat adventurer author and mayor former conservative leadership hopeful rory stewart to run for london mayor mr stewart who is running as an independent after quitting the tory party told visitors to the website how he knows change ca nt happen sitting behind a desk he continued so whether you have a floor or a sofa from havering to hounslow in council flats to houseboats rory would love you to show him your london the # comekipwithme idea appears to be a continuation of the # rorywalks campaign which saw the politician tour the country in his bid to become tory leader the 47-year old decided to run to be an independent london mayor after having the tory whip removed along with 20 other rebels who had voted against the government over brexit he is up against incumbent labour mayor sadiq khan tory shaun bailey liberal democrat siobhan benita and green party co - leader sian berry the politics of hs2 are difficult for boris johnson especially since so many tory mps hate the 100bn plus cost the destruction of ancient pasture and woodland the perceived harm to their rural constituents but the bigger politics for boris another blue brick in the red wall johnson is the perception of whether today 's modified version is seen as an upgrading or downgrading of the portion north of birmingham his colleagues insist what is planned will be central to his promises to transform both the infrastructure and the prospects of the north they claim what will happen is that hs2 to manchester and leeds what is known as hs2b will be much more closely integrated into the so called northern powerhouse as i understand it this is about making sure the high speed line is part of a new network of railway lines connecting all the northern cities in the words of a government source so hs2 to birmingham will be given the green light hs2a from west midlands to crewe will also be approved boris johnson to confirm hs2 will go ahead irish sea bridge scoping work begins on boris johnson 's ambitious idea new fears over where hs2 is going and hs2b will be reworked as part of a bolder regeneration scheme a sort of much more jam tomorrow for parts of england north of birmingham it will all sound ambitious but given that shovels in the ground work on these northern powerhouse projects are years away quite a lot of trust will be needed that yet another southern pm wo n't ultimately betray the north again ps you may remember that the northern powerhouse is the child of the former chancellor george osborne but he can expect little gratitude or reward from boris johnson and i am told he will have no enhanced role in these ambitious new plans the point is that dominic cummings the pm 's chief aide blames osborne among others for the massive hs2 cost over runs which have seen its estimated cost treble to more than 100bn here is what a number 10 source says about him osborne is one of those most guilty of blowing tens of billions on hs2 and it would be criminal to let him anywhere near any major project ever again the home office has gone ahead with a planned deportation flight to jamaica but some detainees due on the flight did not leave after a last minute court of appeal intervention on monday evening the home office was ordered not to deport many of the detainees amid concerns mobile phone outages had prevented access to legal advice lady justice simler said detainees held in detention centres close to heathrow should not be removed unless the home office is satisfied they had access to a functioning non - o2 sim card on or before february 3 according to campaign group detention action around 56 people were being held in the two heathrow detention centres on tuesday 17 people were flown to jamaica it is not known exactly how many people were being held in the third centre brook house which was not covered by the court order all the detainees have been convicted of offences which received a sentence of at least one year in prison however a number of them are thought to have been convicted of one time drug offences when they were young and have lived in the uk for most of their lives but government ministers have defended the flight saying the detainees have been convicted of serious crimes including drug trafficking violence and firearms offences on tuesday after a plane was pictured leaving stansted a home office spokesperson said today 17 serious foreign criminals were deported from the uk they were convicted of rape violent crimes and drug offences and had a combined sentence length of 75 years as well as a life sentence we make no apology whatsoever for seeking to remove dangerous foreign criminals we will be urgently pursuing the removal of those who were prevented from boarding the flight due to a legal challenge over a mobile network failure they added the home office regrets the court ruling which prevented the removal from our country of foreign criminals convicted of rape sexual attacks violence and drug crimes which spread misery across our communities the government had previously defended the deportation decision saying it is criminality not nationality which counts despite concerns the windrush scandal could be repeated who was deported the home office said the 17 people deported to jamaica on tuesday included two rapists one person with a conviction for violent assault one person convicted of wounding with intent to cause gbh one person convicted of violent crime against a person eight people with drugs offences one person convicted of robbery one person convicted of robbery with a firearm one person convicted of conspiracy to rob and possession of a firearm one persoconvicted of burglary confusion over legal status of dozens due to be deported to jamaica on windrush ' flight what have campaigners said bella sankey of detention action said the campaign group believed that some of the people who were due for deportation were not on the flight because they were covered by a court of appeal order but those who it did not cover were on the plane we are trying to ensure that all of those covered by the protection of the court were not removed and that the government did not breach the court order ms sankey said we think that what is most likely is that people were taken from brook house immigration removal centre and put on the flight and those are the people who have probably gone because that detention centre was not covered by the order most importantly we have spent the last few days gathering further evidence from people that were being held at brook house that they experienced similar problems with access to justice so there are huge question marks over whether those people that have been removed have actually had their rights breached we will be thinking about pursuing redress and trying to understand whether that has happened ms sankey continued she believed the flight was an early show of strength from the government on its agenda on these issues the joint council for the welfare of immigrants jcwi said our thoughts are with the families who have just been forced apart by the government with the children who have lost their fathers with the women who 've become single mothers overnight two government commissioned independent reviews the windrush lessons learned review and the shaw review have both said the government should stop deporting people who arrived here as children the government has not published the windrush review or addressed its recommendations in any way and without that it is unlawful for deportation of those who have been here since childhood to continue it 's deeply unjust if people who grew up here whose lives and families are here can be exiled to a country which is totally foreign to them they are british in every meaningful way and if the law allows those people to be exiled it needs to change what has the government said chancellor and former home secretary sajid javid has defended the deportation decision saying the government will always do what we can to protect the public speaking on bbc radio 5 live the chancellor said these are all foreign national offenders they have all received custodial sentences of 12 months or more they are responsible for crimes like manslaughter rape dealing in class a drugs and it is absolutely right when they have served their sentence that we send them out of the country because they are not british nationals they are not members of the windrush generation they are all foreign national offenders what happened on monday and what is the court ruling about the court of appeal ruling on monday ordered the home office not to deport anyone held in two detention centres close to heathrow colnbrooke and harmondsworth amid concerns mobile phone outages had prevented access to legal advice lady justice simler said those detainees should not be removed unless the home office is satisfied they had access to a functioning non - o2 sim card on or before february 3 the judge granted the order without a court hearing following an urgent application on paper by charity detention action the charity argued that some of the detainees at the two heathrow centres still do not have a functioning mobile phone following issues with an o2 phone mast in the area but the order does not apply to brook house detention centre which is close to gatwick although campaigners say detainees have experienced similar problems with communication networks what else happened on monday the flight sparked a protest outside downing street on monday evening which ended up with demonstrators blocking the roads around parliament square there were heated scenes in the house of commons on monday afternoon as labour mps put in an urgent question on the matter for the government there were shouts of shame as home secretary priti patel left the chamber leaving junior minister kevin foster to respond mr foster insisted no british nationals were on the flight and said deportation rules were applied on the criminality not the nationality of the offender adding the foreign nationals on that flight have been sentenced to a total of 300 years in prison the offences are as we said relate to everything from sex offending serious drug trafficking offences violent offences firearms offences mr foster was repeatedly asked by mps for more specific information on the nature of offences committed by those on the flight but refused to provide more detail more than 170 mps signed a letter calling on the prime minister to step in and stop the flight has anything else been said about deportations the flight follows news of a leaked report commissioned by ministers in the wake of the windrush scandal which warned the government that the deportation policy should be reconsidered in all but the most severe cases written in june 2019 the document said government should review its policy and approach to fnos foreign national offenders if necessary through primary legislation it should consider ending all deportations of fnos where they arrived in the uk as children say before age of 13 alternatively deportation should only be considered in the most severe cases fianna fail has been confirmed as the largest party in irelands next parliament by the narrowest margin over a surging sinn fein micheal martins party finished with 38 seats to sinn feins 37 at the end of two days of counting but given the fianna fail speaker was re - elected without contest both parties essentially won the same number of seats taoiseach leo varadkars fine gael was the big loser recording one of the worst results in its history winning only 35 seats having entered the campaign as the largest party on 47 despite being edged in seat numbers sinn fein is undoubtedly the party with most to celebrate having smashed irelands long standing two party system why this irish election has changed the rules and what it means for the uk taoiseach limps back to dail but is left licking wounds after sinn fein advance mary lou mcdonalds party triumphed in the popular vote and may have won many more seats potentially an additional 11 if it had fielded more candidates in the landmark contest hours before counting finished ms mcdonald predicted she could be poised to become irelands next leader on an impromptu walkabout in dublin city centre she said i may well be the next taoiseach yes she later told the media i think it would be a mighty thing to have a sinn fein taoiseach and also a woman perhaps in the job but you might say she would say that would nt she despite receiving the most first preference votes sinn feins place in the next government is not guaranteed all three major parties are far short of the 80 seats required for a dail majority so barring another election some form of coalition is inevitable the task of forming a government could be a long and tortuous one and may force either fianna fail or fine gael to back track on long standing pledges never to do business with sinn fein smaller parties and groupings such as the greens labour the social democrats and solidarity / people before profit and a sizeable number of independent tds may all be courted as the main parties seek junior coalition partners ms mcdonalds preference is for a coalition of left wing parties and independents without any input from the centre right fianna fail and fine gael however it remains doubtful whether such an alliance could generate sufficient numbers for a majority a coalition of fianna fail sinn fein and the green party which ended with 12 seats is seen by many as the most likely option but on monday a senior fianna fail politician described a coalition with sinn fein as untenable jim ocallaghan also insisted his party leader mr martin had not softened his stance on ruling out the party as government partners mr ocallaghans views are not echoed by all his colleagues with some fianna fail members having indicated a willingness to do business with the sinn fein mr varadkar has maintained his pre - election stance and ruled out any fine gael / sinn fein coalition another permutation could see the exclusion of sinn fein with fine gael and fianna fail entering power together in a so called grand coalition with another smaller party or grouping though that prospect looks increasingly unlikely ms mcdonald has pledged to work to form a peoples government and get to grips with crises in housing and health the issues that featured so prominently on the campaign trail this election has certainly been seismic and historic its been an election that s really been driven by a demand for change by the people she said sinn fein received 24.5 % of the vote share on first preference in saturdays election fianna fail got 22.2 % and fine gael 20.9 % the final breakdown of the 160 seats is fianna fail 38 sinn fein 37 fine gael 35 greens 12 labour 6 social democrats 6 solidarity / people before profit 5 aontu 1 independents4change 1 and independents 19 on monday fine gael finance minister paschal donohoe said no party had an automatic right to govern it is clear that no political party in our country has a monopoly on representing the people of ireland he said on sunday mr martin declined to repeat his pre - election pledge never to do business with sinn fein he later cautioned observers not to jump the gun in interpreting his remarks as a signal an alliance with the party was in the offing mr varadkars last government a minority fine gael led administration that included several independent tds was sustained in power through a historic confidence and supply arrangement with fianna fail that pact between two parties founded from opposing sides of irelands civil war of the 1920s took 70 days to negotiate following the inconclusive 2016 general election it looks unlikely that either party will countenance a similar arrangement this time round boris johnson is expected to confirm hs2 will go ahead on tuesday despite concerns over its budget and the environmental impact of construction the controversial high speed railway scheme is likely to be discussed at a cabinet meeting in the morning before the prime minister makes a statement on the project it has been reported that mr johnson will give the green light for phase 1 between london and birmingham but say more analysis is needed on the cost of the route extending further north to manchester and leeds high speed trains will also run beyond the new lines on existing tracks as far as edinburgh and glasgow hs2 ltd the government owned company responsible for developing and building the railway says it will boost capacity and cut journey times itv news political correspondent romilly weeks on the balancing act the pm has had to perform over hs2 former hs2 ltd chairman douglas oakervee was commissioned by the government in august 2019 to lead a review into whether or not the programme should be scrapped amid rising costs and delays it has been widely leaked that the review found hs2 could cost up to 106 billion but concluded that on balance it should continue hs2 's original budget was 32.7 billion at 2011 prices it was due to open in december 2026 but hs2 ltd chairman allan cook said last year it would be prudent to plan for an opening between 2028 and 2031 last month whitehall 's spending watchdog said the scheme is over budget and behind schedule because its complexity and risks were under estimated the national audit office warned that it is impossible to estimate with certainty what the final cost could be hs2 has been the subject of years of intensive lobbying from politicians and opposition groups several environmental organisations claim building it will cause huge damage to natural habitats including dozens of ancient woodlands communities living on or near the route have expressed anger at the impact on their lives while many people have said the project is simply too expensive and the money would be better spent elsewhere chancellor sajid javid set to back controversial hs2 rail project for labour shadow transport secretary andy mcdonald said the measures would not reverse the damage done by years of conservative cuts after years of under investment and cuts this unambitious announcement is nowhere near enough to make the difference that transport users our economy or our environment need he said the conservatives are refusing to reverse their colossal 645 million a year cuts to bus budgets which have caused thousands of routes to be axed and fares to soar the announcement will come alongside a move to invest 5 billion in order to overhaul bus and cycle links in english regions outside of london mr johnson will say the five year funding package will provide more frequent services and simpler more affordable fares it will also allow for new priority bus routes and the purchase of at least 4,000 zero emission buses in england and wales the move will be seen as a sop to placate tory mps critical of hs2 who have argued the money would be better spent on improving local transport links in the north and the midlands as well improving bus services mr johnson will promise 250 miles of new cycle routes across england with dozens of mini - holland schemes to make town centres safer for cyclists ahead of the announcement mr johnson said local transport connections have a truly transformative role to play in levelling up infrastructure across the country our daily journeys for work or leisure are about so much more than just getting from a to b they are the key to accessing skilled jobs and opportunities boosting businesses and unlocking economic growth for towns cities and regions across this country that 's why improving connectivity by overhauling bus services and making cycling easier than ever is such an important step forward to make sure every community has the foundations it needs to thrive words by itv news westminster producer lewis denison

brexit plans when she spoke at the despatch box wearing the outfit video report by itv news correspondent geraint vincent sinn fein has emerged as the most popular party after ireland 's election on saturday securing the most first preference votes and topping the polls in the vast majority of constituencies they received 24.5 % of the vote share on first preference while rivals fianna fail and fine gael got 22.2 % and 20.9 % the almost even split means it could be months before a new government takes power as parties look to form coalitions between themselves to secure a majority in the dail the irish parliament sinn fein president mary lou mcdonald said she would form a people 's government and pledged to tackle ireland 's housing and health crises asked whether her party 's performance was a revolution of irish politics she answered yes you could call it that for sure taoiseach limps back to dail but is left licking wounds after sinn fein advance sinn fein leader hails prospect of united ireland as party set for major gains in general election three largest parties neck and neck in irish election exit poll suggests who are sinn fein the left wing sinn fein party campaigned to build more public housing reduce childcare costs lower the retirement age to 65 and bolster police numbers they 're also an avowedly republican party and have pledged to introduce a referendum on whether northern ireland should leave the united kingdom to join the republic of ireland they plan to establish a parliamentary committee and citizens ' assembly to plan for irish unity and ms mcdonald believes a referendum is likely within the next five years we now have a democratic pathway to irish unity to ending partition she said the party has its roots in the irish war of independence in the 1920s where they supported the original irish republican army ira against the uk the party split and took different sides in ireland 's civil war over whether to accept the peace treaty to the war of independence which partitioned northern ireland and left it out of the new irish free state after more splits and reformations the party again came to prominence in northern ireland during the troubles 1960s-1990s where it campaigned for civil rights for the catholic community and was linked to the provisional ira as its political wing asked about the parties ' past links to the paramilitary group ms mcdonald said it did n't achieve anything constructive i think we have managed to construct a peace process over the last few decades which is robust and strong she said video report by itv news correspondent geraint vincent since the 1998 good friday agreement sinn fein have shared power with unionists in northern ireland 's stormont parliament they have long fielded candidates in the republic of ireland 's elections in 2007 they had four out of 153 seats but now with first preference votes counted they 're in the lead what are first preference votes the irish system means voters select their first preference on their ballot papers followed by their second preference third preference and so on if their first preference does not receive enough votes to win that constituency then their vote is transferred to their second preference and so on the uk uses the first past the post system where voters only receive a single non - transferable vote and the candidate with the most votes but not necessarily the majority of votes wins what will the next government look like despite winning the most first preference votes sinn fein only fielded candidates in 42 constituencies half the number that fine gael and fianna fail each put out in the fight for 159 seats fianna fail led by michael martin remains best placed to secure the most seats while fine gael looks to be the big loser and will concede several high profile seats fine gael leader and current taoiseach leo varadkar struggled to reclaim dublin west where he was outpolled by a sinn fein candidate paul donnelly varadkar only got over the line after the fifth round of counting sinn fein 's unprecedented performance has broken the 90-year long dominance of fine gael and fianna fail both parties lean centre right and both have previously ruled out a coalition with sinn fein opening up the possibility of a merger between the two historic rivals the last government under mr varadkar was already propped up by a historic confidence and supply deal with fianna fail it took 70 days to negotiate after an inconclusive result in the 2016 general election but sinn fein 's overflow of votes could boost other left leaning parties in ireland such as the greens labour the social democrats and solidarity / people before profit all of which will be courted by the three main parties as junior coalition partners fine gael finance minister paschal donohoe said it is clear that no political party in our country has a monopoly on representing the people of ireland but ms mcdonald said the proportion of votes sinn fein received earned it a place in government this vote for sinn fein is for sinn fein to be in government for sinn fein to make a difference for sinn fein to be tested for sinn fein to deliver she said there are 160 seats in the dail parliament the speaker is automatically re - elected leaving 159 seats up for grabs and 80 the magic number for a majority government officials are examining the potential for a bridge linking scotland and northern ireland after the prime minister touted the idea late last year despite critics saying it would be a waste of time boris johnson 's official spokesman said the project was a proper piece of work that a range of officials were already looking into downing street said boris johnson who is known to be a fan of bridges was ambitious about infrastructure projects and is looking at a wide range of schemes across the uk which could improve connectivity mr johnson has repeatedly spoken about the prospect of a bridge even though experts have warned that the depth of the irish sea and the presence of dumped munitions would cause problems for any project the project could cost a reported 20 billion although mr johnson has previously said it would only cost about 15 billion the prime minister 's official spokesman said the pm set out this was an idea which he believed could have some merit so as a result of that you would expect the government to be looking into it the scoping work is being run from number 10 with a range of officials reporting into it irish sea bridge boris johnson puts price on linking scotland to northern ireland more than 40 m of taxpayers money wasted on london 's failed garden bridge ' boris johnson 's proposal of bridge across the channel met with mixed response the prime minister told mps watch this space when asked about the prospect of a boris bridge in parliament in december 2019 the distance from larne to portpatrick one of the most likely routes for a bridge is around 45 km there is no problem with distance money or the beaufort 's dyke explosives disposal area according to the prime minister in november 2018 he said the problem is not the undersea beaufort 's dyke or lack of funds the problem is an absence of political will the new plan is the latest in a list of bridge projects suggested by the prime minister when london mayor he infamously began a huge project which would have seen a garden bridge decorated with dense flora erected across the river thames the plan was eventually abandoned then when theresa may 's foreign secretary he suggested building a bridge across the english channel which would connect britain with france the project never got off the ground on the latest bridge government sources say it will be possible to build it with a tunnelled section to cope with some of the difficulties caused by the depth of the irish sea once a familiar sight on britain 's school runs the number of lollipop men and women is in

residents confusion surrounds the legal status of scores of people set to be deported to jamaica the government has defended a flight set to deport 50 people to the caribbean saying it is criminality not nationality which counts despite concerns the windrush scandal could be repeated duncan lewis solicitors which is representing 15 people due to be on the flight filed papers at the high court and called for an urgent oral hearing on monday afternoon to discuss the matter but home secretary priti patel said she was legally obliged to order the deportation of foreign criminals who had received sentences of 12 months or more in prison late on monday the court of appeal ordered the home office not to remove anyone scheduled to be deported from two detention centres near heathrow airport on the 6.30am flight to jamaica on tuesday unless satisfied they had access to a functioning non - o2 sim card on or before february 3 lady justice simler granted the order without a court hearing following an urgent application on paper by charity detention action the charity argued that some of the detainees at colnbrooke and harmondsworth detention centres still do not have a functioning mobile phone following issues with an o2 phone mast in the area and did not have adequate access to legal advice it was not clear to how many this could apply and nor whether they would be on the plane or not home office is to start making windrush payments under compensation scheme windrush generation to be commemorated with memorial at waterloo station hostile windrush environment can be traced back to post - ww2 governments a home office spokeswoman later said the planned charter flight to jamaica is specifically for deporting foreign national offenders those detained for removal include people convicted of manslaughter rape violent crime and dealing class a drugs we are urgently asking the judge to reconsider their ruling and it would be inappropriate to comment further whilst legal proceedings are ongoing home office minister kevin foster had earlier gone further in defending the planned flight saying the flight is about keeping the public safe he added it does not matter what part of the world they are from whether it is the united states jamaica australia or canada it 's criminality not nationality which counts shadow home secretary diane abbott said many of the proposed deportees came to the uk as children and have no memory of jamaica adding those on the flight were being punished twice does the home secretary accept that these deportations constitute double jeopardy because the persons have already served an appropriate sentence for their crime she asked and is the home secretary aware that over 170 mps from all political parties have written to the prime minister calling for this deportation flight to be halted she urged the government not to repeat the mistakes of the windrush scandal a number of the people due on the flight are thought to have been convicted of drug offences when they were young one of those on the flight is a 23-year old who came to the uk aged five and served half of a 15-month sentence in 2015 after being convicted of possessing class a drugs with intent to supply at 17 labour 's david lammy suggested the flight should be stopped at least until a report into the windrush scandal had been published he said a leak of the report revealed its author wendy williams says the government should not be deporting people under the age of 13 he asked mr foster to confirm that there are people on that flight who arrived in this country aged two aged three aged five aged 11 members of the windrush generation came to the uk from caribbean countries many on the boat hms empire windrush and were given a legal right to work in the uk following world war ii the windrush scandal relates to those who were wrongly detained denied legal rights threatened with deportation and wrongly deported from the uk by the home office tottenham mp mr lammy said the deportation flight shows the government holds with such disrespect the contribution of west indian caribbean and black people in this country he said when when will black lives matter again mr foster said the deportation was going ahead to protect the public and can not and should not be conflated with the wrongs suffered by the windrush generation toufique hossain director of public law at duncan lewis who is leading the legal challenge said many of the clients had come to the uk as young children aged between four and 13 he said we are about to submit court papers to launch a judicial review and have asked for an urgent oral hearing in the high court this afternoon campaigners have said that their information indicates that most have been convicted of drugs related offences often only once and several have been groomed into county lines operations these individuals are more british than foreign and their removal is neither reasonable nor proportionate he added and let 's be clear there are no british nationals on that flight and let 's be clear the foreign nationals on that flight have been sentenced to a total of 300 years in prison the offences are as we said relate to everything from sex offending serious drug trafficking offences violent offences firearms offences you know that is what is happening in this instance the flight is thought to be leaving the uk at 6.30am on tuesday however more than 170 cross - party mps have called on the prime minister to halt the flight amid concerns people who came to the country as young children will be on board swedish student 's plane protest stops afghan asylum seeker 's deportation friends join teenagers to halt threat of deportation it follows news of a leaked report commissioned by ministers in the wake of the windrush scandal which warned the government that the policy should be reconsidered in all but the most severe cases earlier on monday cabinet minister rishi sunak was asked about the case of tajay thompson who is facing deportation to jamaica having served half of a 15-month sentence in 2015 after being convicted of possessing class a drugs with intent to supply at 17 mr thompson now 23 and living in south london said he has no links to the caribbean nation which he has only visited twice since coming to the uk aged five i feel like i was born here jamaica is not my country mr thompson said as he insisted he was groomed into a gang as a teenager its not like i m a rapist or a murderer i ve made a mistake when i was 17 and its now going to affect my whole life mr sunak said he was not familiar with mr thompsons case but insisted all due process will have been followed labour mp nadia whittome organised the letter protesting against the home office flight which she says is intended to deport people who have been resident in the uk for decades the fact is that many of the individuals in question have lived in the uk since they were children and at least 41 british children are now at risk of losing their fathers through this charter flight the nottingham east mp said gay rugby player facing deportation end my three years in limbo sajid javid the government risks repeating the mistakes of the windrush scandal unless it cancels this flight and others like it until the windrush lessons learned review has been published and its recommendations implemented labour shadow immigration minister bell ribeiro addy said the flight is the most brutal and inhumane way to remove people from this country it often lacks due process has little regard for deportees safety and even less for their right to a family life she added a draft of a report commissioned by the government in the wake of the windrush scandal recommended that ministers rethink the flights particularly for those who came to the uk as children the draft written in june 2019 said government should review its policy and approach to fnos foreign national offenders if necessary through primary legislation it should consider ending all deportations of fnos where they arrived in the uk as children say before age of 13 alternatively deportation should only be considered in the most severe cases on monday the house of commons will also hold a second reading debate on the windrush compensation scheme expenditure bill which would give the government financial authority to make payments for people who suffered adverse effects as a result of not having the right documents to demonstrate their uk status video report by itv news correspondent geraint vincent the prospect of a united ireland is absolutely closer the president of sinn fein has told itv news as exit polls in ireland 's general election indicate a strong surge in support for the republican party following voting on saturday sinn fein along with fianna fail and fine gael are tied in first preference votes mary lou mcdonald said the support for her party is a big statement of change and that she expected a referendum on irish unity to take place in the next five years or so an exit poll suggested almost a quarter of voters backed sinn fein in the general election both fianna fail and fine gael consistently ruled out going into coalition with their rivals in the run up to the general election however fianna fail 's leader micheal martin stopped short of repeating his pre - election pledge never to do business with sinn fein and did not rule out entering government with ms mcdonald 's party but taoiseach and fine gael leader leo varadkar did re - state his determination not to partner up with sinn fein he said he would not be speaking to ms mcdonald with a view to forming a coalition insisting fine gael was not compatible with sinn fein speaking in the constituency of dublin central where she was confirmed as the first candidate elected with 11,223 votes ms mcdonald also told itv news she believes there is now a democratic pathway to irish unity when asked by geraint vincent if she thought some voters in ireland and onlookers from the uk may have concerns over sinn fein 's success due to their past link to the ira sinn fein was the political wing of the ira during the troubles the 50-year old said people have nothing to be fearful of we are an open democratic party we 've won in this election in this state a quarter of the popular vote ms macdonald said i suppose we could all look at each others ' pasts particularly across the irish sea and wonder i do n't think that achieves anything constructive i think we have managed to construct a peace process over the last few decades which is robust and strong and we now have a democratic pathway to irish unity to ending partition and i believe that a referendum on that will happen in the next five years or so and i want us to prepare for that not just in this island but in britain also three largest parties neck and neck in irish election exit poll sinn fein under fire over soft approach to criminality ms mcdonald also hailed her party 's success as demonstrating that ireland no longer has a two party system it 's a big statement that this is no longer a two party system it 's a statement that people want a different type of government and people have great confidence in us and i say that with all humility she said the president of sinn fein said she was willing to talk to all political leaders but expressed a desire to lead a coalition made up of left leaning parties without any input from fianna fail or fine gael which are both centre right in outlook ms mcdonald said she has already reached to the greens social democrats and people before profit to discuss the prospect of them joining her party in government it 's been an election about change she said the extraordinary thing is that it seems that the political establishment and by that i mean fianna fail and fine gael are in a state of denial they are still not listening to what the people have said i want us to have a government for the people i want us to have ideally a government with no fianna fail or fine gael in it while it remains unclear whether it will ultimately be part of any future coalition sinn fein 's performance has undoubtedly sent shockwaves through ireland 's political establishment the final declaration of seats remains a long way off but the first wave of declarations suggest it is set to shatter ireland 's long established two party system despite topping the polls across the country when first preferences were added up sinn fein is still unlikely to emerge with the most seats that is mainly because it ran significantly fewer candidates than its two main rivals 42 compared to fianna fail 's 84 and fine gael 's 82 fianna fail looks in prime position to return as the largest party with fine gael braced for the loss of several seats no party will come close to securing the 80 seats required for a majority in the dail parliament so some form of coalition government is inevitable mr varadker managed to cling on as td for dublin west but he had to wait to the fifth count before being elected holding up four fingers he said another term of it his party is predicted to end the night with a seat total in the mid to high 30s having entered the campaign with 47 but he was adamant he would not be joining forces with sinn fein in a coalition my view on this is exactly what i have said during the campaign and what i said during the campaign and what my party said during the campaign was n't a tactic or a strategy it was what we honestly believed and for us coalition with sinn fein is not an option he said we are willing to talk to other parties about how we could form a government and give this country a government that can spend the next five years dealing with the problems that we have had to tackle for the past few years his tone was decidedly different to that of fianna fail 's leader micheal martin who was repeatedly pressed to restate his opposition to a potential sinn fein partnership while insisting there were significant incompatibility issues in terms of policy he did not dismiss the suggestion outright our policies our positions and principles have n't changed overnight or in 24 hours he said he added we will obviously listen the people have spoken and there is no greater democrat than i but that said we will not pre - empt the outcome itself because it 's very clear to us that the destination of the final seats in many constituencies can not be called now how does ireland 's voting system work the republic of ireland uses the single transferrable vote a form of proportional representation in which voters rank candidates in order of their preference on election day voters number the candidates giving their first preference to the candidate they most want to see elected numbering all the candidates in descending order down to their least favourite however voters can put numbers next to as many or as few candidates as they like the numbers tell the people counting to move your vote if your favourite candidate has enough votes already or stands no chance of winning in order for a candidate to be elected they need to receive a set number of votes known as the quota the quota is based on the number of vacancies and the number of votes cast after the first count has finished the surplus of votes for a successful candidate who has exceeded their quota is distributed the votes are distributed to the second preferences on all of the ballot papers when all the first count surplus votes have been distributed then the people counting the vote remove the least popular candidate people who voted for them have their votes moved to their second favourite candidate this process continues until every vacancy is filled ireland 's three largest parties are neck and neck following the general election an exit poll has suggested fine gael are on 22.4 % sinn fein on 22.3 % and fianna fail on 22.2 % in what has been described as a statistical dead heat meanwhile the green party has been forecast to take 7.9 % labour 4.6 % the social democrats 3.4 % and solidarity / people before profit 2.8 % if the unprecedented results of the exit poll are realised on sunday following the counting of the votes it will represent a breakthrough for sinn fein challenging the 90-year duopoly of the state 's two main parties the odds would still be stacked against mary lou mcdonald leading the next government as taoiseach since sinn fein only fielded 42 candidates in the race for the dail parliament 's 160 seats none of the three parties are expected to reach the 80-seat threshold to enable it to govern on its own and a coalition administration of some complexion is almost inevitable negotiations to form a coalition government are likely to be complex with both fine gael and fianna fail previously stating they would not enter an agreement with sinn fein sinn fein 's director of elections pearse doherty has said his party will sit down with all parties and independents to discuss forming a government the view from sinn fein is clearly that the best outcome of this election is a government without fianna fail or fine gael and the worst outcome would be where we have been fine gael and fianna fail he said there are smaller parties there are independents that we can see the support that they will get there 's no doubt that they will have a number of tds elected so we will be discussing with all parties and independents about whether we can form a government that is based on fairness that is based on the type of programme that we put forward and that 's what we promised the people before the election that is what we will deliver after the election following the last irish election negotiations to form the fine gael fianna fail coalition took 70 days the exit poll carried out by the irish times ' pollsters ipsos mrbi was commissioned jointly by the irish times rte tg4 and ucd the exit poll results were announced on saturday evening after voting finished at 10 pm after sampling across the country among 5,000 respondents there have been conflicting reports over voter turnout in ireland 's first saturday parliamentary poll in more than a century many areas reported a brisk voting pace through the day but taoiseach leo varadkar claimed at one stage that the numbers going to the polls were actually low poor weather conditions caused by storm ciara and the ireland rugby international were among other factors that could influence voters ' decisions on whether to enter the booths the country 's leaders cast their votes on saturday morning president michael d higgins was accompanied by his wife sabina at a dublin polling station micheal martin the leader of main opposition party fianna fail voted with his wife daughter and two sons early on saturday morning in co cork in the south sinn fein leader ms mcdonald also cast her vote in the capital on an important day brexit did not feature prominently in a campaign dominated by domestic issues like spiralling rental prices record breaking homeless numbers controversy over the state pension age and a struggling health service there appears to be a mood for change and the exit poll also suggested that sinn fein attracted support from younger voters who want to end fine gael 's nine years in power but are

mrs leadsom 56 the member for south northamptonshire since 2010 of course things have changed massively in the years since but only by shining a light on unacceptable behaviour and calling it out for what it is will workplaces foster an environment and culture that values men and women equally mrs leadsom said steps the government was taking such as protecting women from workplace discrimination due to pregnancy would enhance business and improve peoples lives helping to unleash the full potential that the uk has to offer as a truly independent nation we should be proud of the great strides this country has taken over the last decades to eradicate discrimination from our workplaces while also knowing that we need to go further to make the uk fit for the future she wrote it would be much better if we just did nt have to talk about diversity anymore if equality was the absolute norm it will take some time to get there and i truly believe we will especially if we keep up the good progress to date mrs leadsom is believed to sit on the endangered list of female ministers alongside work and pensions secretary therese coffey environment secretary theresa villiers housing minister

dispute and strike against unfair exploitative and unjust employers under her leadership and she said that standing on the side of workers and trade unions no questions asked is going to be crucial in

been suggesting that shadow brexit secretary sir keir starmer is likely to come out on top in the ballot of members and supporters for the four candidate race an ipsos mori study released on thursday put ms long bailey in last place when 1,001 voters were asked if she has what it takes to be a prime minister she also trailed in last place with sir keir on top lisa nandy second and emily thornberry third when labour supporters were asked the same question one policy she hopes will be popular with the wider public is a law to give workers the right not to be contacted outside of normal working

ignore their mobiles mr corbyns successor will be announced on april 4 by itv news multimedia producer charlie bayliss with brexit now a reality attention will turn to the second round of negotiations between the uk and the eu britain has just months to negotiate a new relationship with the eu including thrashing out a new trade agreement with its closest partners some critics have said the short timescale is n't long enough to reach an agreement although boris johnson has said he wants to secure a free trade deal without agreeing to match eu regulations itv news has spoken to jason langrish a trade expert who was involved in the comprehensive economic and trade agreement between canada and the eu which is widely held up among commentators as the gold standard of deals so what will the negotiations focus on how many people are involved in the deals do personalities play a part and what should we be looking out for we 'll set laws that suit us chief brexit negotiator insists britain will not accept eu demands post - brexit britain to be champions of free trade dominic raab says one in five chance of chancellor meeting growth target think tank warns what chance does the uk have of securing a trade deal with the eu in order to avoid a hard brexit it 's not a case of the hard work starting now as there is n't really enough time left unless the uk is willing to contemplate an extension it could be a case of the hard work starts for six months even when the uk government says they want a bare bones agreement it 's like saying we just want a house we can live in well you 've got to frame it put in insulation dry wall fit it with electrics and plumbing it requires 80 per cent of the work to be done this idea that the uk could do a simple trade agreement is n't realistic when it comes to such a complex economy ken clarke tells itv news dominic cummings should vanish what does a trade deal cover in a modern sense it 's much more than trade and covers comprehensive economic agreements that span further than they used to that 's not how economy works anymore now there 's supply chains professional services public contracts pharmaceuticals and more all these different elements form part of an agreement does the uk have the expertise to negotiate a trade deal this is one of the biggest problems and is something which is n't talked about enough most of the uk team does n't have the experience in the last 10 years canada has organised ceta re - negotiated nafta trans - pacific partnership negotiated with chile and the wto it 's a seasoned team of negotiators with an established mechanism coordinating with different stakeholders that capacity takes years to build up and the only way to build up is by going through these negotiations the uk will be learning as they go along and that 's a difficult thing unfortunately for the uk their most important negotiation is also their first with regards to the eu they have 40 years of experience in this area and some of who are british can the uk bring in negotiators the problem with bringing negotiators in from the outside is whether they will be listened to what commitment are you signing up to there could be a hard brexit in eight or 10 months time so it 's very difficult also there 's a case of people moving as well logistically it 's difficult but there has been moves made by the british government but with limited success what sort of deal do you imagine the uk could strike with the eu a reason why countries use the single market is because it eliminates restrictive elements it 's the main benefit of the eu and they will not want to compromise that by giving the uk a sweetheart deal as then other countries will want similar arrangements if the uk makes a pivot towards the us it will compromise its access to eu markets if access is compromised it undermines values of trade even with american companies they will want easier access to the larger market of the eu which is 600 m people not just the 60 m in the uk there will be some concessions from the eu but it 's one thing or another on a basic level how do these agreements start first thing that 's usually done is a scoping exercise countries will hire an external consultant who will carry out research this looks at if we do this what will the outcome be and what sort of outcome can we expect the research might come back as this could be worth 15bn a year both sides will go back and launch negotiations and go through in depth review talk to stakeholders and discuss a broad negotiating mandate at a cabinet level where they will say these are the areas with what we want to focus on in the first round of negotiations nothing is really negotiated you familiarise yourself with the other side and establish what are sensitive issues what is the low hanging fruit etc different negotiating tables are then created in the ceta deal there were 22 tables including market access agriculture regulatory cooperation government procurement and more as you move forward some of these tables are closed within a year but then as time moves on you see what sensitive issues are what do we have and what are the red lines that 's when negotiations slow down and it becomes clearer what you are willing to do this is where it 's important to have a strong relationship between the negotiators and the politicians they will say this is where we are this is what we are not getting movement on and what can we stomach politically in case of the canada eu deal canada needed to get agriculture into the deal the eu needed access to government contracts if this ca n't be agreed then no deal is signed it 's down to a small number of issues all political in nature it 's about finding a path forward then you know there will be industries which lose so what have you got to do you 've got to buy them off if for example its dairy farmers you 'll put together an aid package for them over a certain amount of years how many people are involved in trade deals in our negotiating rounds sometimes we canada had 100 people while the eu never had more than 30 people talks usually start face to face but then you can start using conference calls because of the uk eu time difference face to face talks might be easier are personalities important in trade talks they 're very important it 's important to have a good working relationship especially between the chief negotiator and their political masters most chief negotiators know each other as it takes 20 - 25 years to become one you do n't just choose a negotiator they 're usually bred itv news approached downing street about the prospect of the uk securing a trade deal with the eu by the end of 2020 a number 10 spokeswoman said we have been clear that we will not be extending transition period this is set out in uk law the uk and eu jointly agreed to reach and agreement by december 2020 and we expect that to happen this was set out in the political declaration jason langrish is the executive director of the canada europe roundtable for business an advocacy group that has been deeply involved in the launch of negotiations for a canada eu comprehensive economic and trade agreement video report by itv news washington correspondent robert moore boris johnson has appointed a new british ambassador to the united states amid reports of a furious row with president donald trump over chinese tech giant huawei dame karen pierce currently the uk permanent representative to the united nations will become the first woman to hold the post downing street said she replaces sir kim darroch who was forced to stand down last year after diplomatic cables he wrote criticising the trump white house were leaked to the press her appointment comes amid reports that the president was apoplectic at mr johnsons decision last week to give huawei a role in building the uks 5 g network pm 's decision on huawei is infuriating the us donald trump cleared of all charges in senate impeachment trial the financial times reported that british officials were taken aback by the force of mr trumps language when the prime minister telephoned to explain the move it followed intensive lobbying from washington that allowing a chinese supplier access to the countrys critical communications networks would constitute a major security risk us officials repeatedly warned that they would withhold intelligence sharing from any ally which did so downing street refused to be drawn directly on the report insisting that the relationship with the us remained excellent however there was no direct denial of the claims asked about the call a no 10 spokesman referred to a statement issued at the time highlighting mr johnsons comments on the need for liked minded countries to work together to diversify the market and break the dominance of a small number of companies mps call for zero tolerance approach to leaks after sir kim darroch row the spokesman expressed confidence that intelligence sharing with the us and other allies in the five eyes partnership australia canada and new zealand would continue as in the past we have been clear that this will in no way inhibit our ability to share intelligence with other countries including five eyes partners he said however media reports from australia claimed that foreign secretary dominic raab who is on a visit to the country came under fire over the decision when he met mps on australias parliamentary intelligence committee in canberra on thursday the sydney morning herald reported that he was confronted by one member who told him how would you feel if the russians laid down infrastructure in your own networks that s how we feel about huawei there was no immediate response from no 10 or the foreign office pompeo warns huawei poses ' real risk to security as he arrives for uk talks but the claims add to the sense that dame karen one of britains most senior diplomats may have her work cut out when she takes up her new role once her appointment is formally approved by the americans as well as the differences over huawei the two countries are at odds over the uks plan to impose a tax on us tech giants with the americans threatening to retaliate with tariffs on the uk car industry the uk is also pressing for the extradition of the wife of a us intelligence official charged with causing the death of 19-year old motorcyclist harry dunn whom the americans are refusing to hand over at the same time the government in london is anxious to secure an early post - brexit free trade deal with the us now that the uk has formally left the eu asked if dame karen would be tasked with repairing relations with washington the no 10 spokesman said the uk has an excellent relationship with the united states and i think dame karens ability as a diplomat is proven by her career in a statement dame karen said i am honoured to have been asked to represent the uk in the us i think it is the uks single most important relationship there is a deep bond between britain and the us built on many pillars an snp activist has alleged that former scottish finance secretary derek

demanded information to give us the veracity and the substance of the points that were being put to us appearing on the bbcs good morning scotland show mr swinney was asked about the government putting up hurdles to try and stop the story and asking to be told the boys name but said they acted decisively the government became aware of these allegations at about 6 pm on wednesday night and because of the significance of what was being put to us we simply asked for information to give us the veracity and the substance of the points that were being put to us he said we saw nothing in writing until we saw the first edition of the sun later on on wednesday evening so we were simply asking for the detail we would ask for in any situation where allegations are being put to us i do nt think anyone even our worst critics could say the government was in any way slow in handling it describing his reaction to the revelations mr swinney said he was utterly stunned by the information when he found out on wednesday evening he added that he had no prior concerns about mr mackays behaviour saying it was the first time that i had heard any revelations of this type derek mackay had been tipped as a possible successor to nicola sturgeon but he has now been forced to quit the scottish government after he allegedly sent hundreds of messages to a 16-year old boy the 42-year old stepped down just hours before he was due to unveil his budget for 2020 - 21 his resignation comes more than two decades after he began his career in politics being elected as a councillor in renfrewsire in 1999 it made him the youngest male councillor in scotland having been elected at just 21 i have behaved foolishly scotlands finance secretary derek mackay resigns over sending messages to 16-year old boy mr mackay went on to become leader of the councils snp group and took them into power in the area for the first time in 2007- at which point he became leader of the council he used

msp for renfrewshire north and west that same year he joined the scottish government becoming minister for local government and planning a reshuffle after nicola sturgeon became first minister in 2014

children but in 2013 he came out as gay mr mackay later described that as the most difficult thing i ve ever had to deal with during his time as finance secretary he was responsible for introducing new scottish income tax rates including a new starter rate set at 19p for lower earners it was unacceptable for john bercow to publicly name house staff in his autobiography without permission the house of commons has said unspeakable the autobiography was published on thursday and includes an account of the bullying allegations made against mr bercow in which a number of officials are named a statement issued by the commons media office on behalf of the house service the body which employs the commons staff said in his book mr bercow has chosen to name a number of staff who have never spoken publicly about their experiences or sought to gain publicity as a result formal bullying complaint made against john bercow by former top official the highly unusual move from the commons comes in the wake of a formal bullying complaint filed against mr bercow in january in the complaint lord lisvane who was clerk of the house alleged staff had been bullied and humiliated by the former speaker mr bercow has consistently denied allegations of bullying from former members of staff in the past responding to thursday 's statement from the commons mr bercow strongly defended his actions a statement said he was entitled to address unfounded allegations made by a small but highly vocal group of people who were trying to blacken his name it added critics are entitled to air their views what they are not entitled to do is to make unfounded allegations and expect mr bercow to say nothing in return t would be odd if mr bercow did not comment on their unfounded allegations and the reasons behind them he was advised by speaker 's counsel not to do so in detail while he was in office he is therefore doing so now if the book had not addressed these issues he would rightly have been accused of serious omission following the publication of the autobiography a house of commons spokesperson said it is unacceptable to publicly name current or former staff without their prior knowledge or authority especially for the purpose of financial gain or commercial success house of commons staff work incredibly hard to enable the effective functioning of our democracy and have a right to expect that their privacy be respected a crucial element of the work of house of commons staff is to provide confidential impartial advice to mps breaking this confidentiality undermines this important principle and also places staff in a position from which they are unable to respond the intervention will be seen as a further setback to mr bercow 's hopes of gaining a peerage after stepping down last year from the speaker 's chair some ministers have however said no one should be given a peerage while they face outstanding allegations of bullying and abuse what prompted the house of commons statement in the book mr bercow said the bullying claims dated back to 2010 when he said there was an attempt by senior clerks to take over the running of his office he said the then clerk of the house dr malcolm jack and his successor lord lisvane then robert rogers had tried to persuade him to replace two of his loyal private secretaries in a shake up of his office the officials they wanted to get rid of were former state school boys who had not been to university he said while dr jack was every inch the ex - public schoolboy in retrospect i wish that i had known that this pitch by the clerks effectively to run the speaker 's office was not the first such attempt he wrote it was an old ploy and had been rejected by my predecessors the clerks wanted both to exert greater influence and to add to the career opportunities for clerks i should have realised this and rejected it video report by itv news scotland correspondent peter smith scotland 's finance secretary derek

formally report a matter to us video report by itv news scotland correspondent peter smith raised in a care home she says was devoid of any actual care megan sutherland says she grew up with hugs not being normal she told itv news about her upbringing in a residential institution on the day a report criticised how caring for children operates in scotland the review outlining a radical blueprint for change concluded the care system in scotland serves its own convenience and failures cost 875 million a year the in depth investigation took account of 5,500 experiences revealing an approach which it describes as fractured bureaucratic and unfeeling for too many children and families one such experience was recalled to itv news by megan who said the current system is not fit for purpose and is killing people scotland sees highest number of drugs deaths in eu with almost 1,200 victims in a year donald tusk eu would enthusiastically welcome independent scotland the fact that hugs were n't normal or that i could be talking to someone about how i felt but then it became ten oclock and it was time for them to go home and the night shift would come in and our rooms would be locked she said it 's not a normal environment for a child to be in kids want posters on their bedrooms they do nt want fire safety posters they want to be able to wear pyjamas downstairs in the day and not have to be worrying about locked doors in their kitchen and not being able to go in and just make a sandwich children raised in care are less likely to gain qualifications and more likely to be dead by 25 megan said that while people her age are going to their friends weddings or birthday parties she has lost three friends in the past year and already been to one funeral you would n't imagine an institution where no one ever hugs them because they 've hurt themselves or because they 're crying because they 're upset she added what happens more often than not is when people get upset in a residential institution they hold you to the ground in a safe hold they call it but that 's not normal it 's actually quite disturbing what does the report say chaired by fiona duncan the independent care review looked into the economic and human cost of the system 's failures for the first time it found 875 million is spent each year on dealing with the impacts of incompetency while 732 million is lost in income tax and national insurance which would have been paid by the care experienced community if they had the same outcomes as their peers ms duncan said i have heard countless stories of when the care system gets it wrong separation trauma stigma and pain too many childhoods have been lost to a system that serves its own convenience rather than those within it this is a radical blueprint for a country that loves nurtures and cherishes its children this is scotland 's chance to care for its children the way all good parents should the review began work in february 2017 and will conclude at the end of march this year it concluded that people who have been in care are twice as likely to have been homeless and earn only around 75 % of their peers the report consists of six parts setting out ambitions for children in the future a summary of conclusions recommendations for change how that can be done finance and a thank you to those who took part a section titled the pinky promise which summarises the findings is also available in a child friendly version to make it more accessible to young people five key foundations for the care system in scotland have been set out in the report these are making sure the voice of children is heard at all stages establishing what families need to thrive making sure care builds childhoods a focus on the importance of relationships scaffolding so there is structure for those in need the report calls for children and young people to be listened to when making decisions about their lives to upend the balance of power it also recommends there is a focus on building life long relationships and that families are kept together whenever it is safe to do so what has the scottish government said first minister nicola sturgeon said in 2016 i accepted a challenge to listen to the experiences of 1,000 looked after young people because i knew the care system needed a transformation and i wanted to hear first hand what had to change it is clear that despite the efforts of those within the system the actual experience of too many people in care is not what we want it to be we will keep listening to and working with care experienced people because the case for transformational change is now unarguable and their voice must shape that change people who took part in the review included those who have experience of living in the care system and those who work in it the review found care services cost 1.2 billion each year video report by itv news washington correspondent robert moore the republican controlled us

lengthen time spent in prison for those convicted of terror offences speaking on the peston show robert buckland said the bill was not muscle clenching or knee jerk reaction to the streatham attack on sunday or that at fishmongers ' hall in november instead the south swindon mp said the government 's plan to ensure those convicted of terror offence serve at least two thirds of their sentences and are only released after a parole board review is in the interest of public protection it 's the first job of government to get that right and that 's what we 're doing he told itv 's political editor robert peston itv news exclusive cctv captures last moments of streatham terror attacker sudesh amman plans to extend terror sentences certainly going to be challenged warns lord carlile how the

in march lawmakers are anxious to speed the bill through in the wake of sunday 's stabbing incident in streatham london where 20-year old convicted terrorist sudesh amman stabbed two people just 10 days after he was released from prison amman was shot dead at the scene by police who were tailing him labor 's rosie duffield also appearing on itv 's peston said she was uncomfortable with pushing the bill through too quickly this is a huge change potentially to our whole legal system so it 's vital that we scrutinise it she said lord carlile a former reviewer of terror legislation raised concerns about the new legislation earlier in the week and said they may be in breach of the law mr buckland conceded that there may well be legal challenges but he said the changes were measured i 'm confident this is not just the legal thing to do but it 's the right thing to do he said he said deradicalisation measures inside prisons had been stepped up in the last few years but he believed some prisoners were n't capable of rehabilitation liberal democrat layla moran has branded the general election campaign ran by former leader jo swinson as arrogant as she admitted a party takeover could be on the cards for herself in the summer in a chat for itv news podcast acting prime minister the oxford west mp said the party spectacularly failed to manage voter expectations adding how ms swinson made a mistake in claiming ahead of the election that she could be prime minister she told podcast host paul brand that ms swinson 's claim combined with the high numbers of seats that we were predicting that made us look a bit hubristic combined with revoke that was seen as arrogant so i do think there were mistakes that were made she added despite admitting her own role in the party 's poor general election performance ms moran thinks she could do the job of leader and is considering whether to run to replace ms swinson i 've been really open that it is a job that i would consider she said but i 'm definitely not at the point where i 'm going to say that i would definitely do it lib dem mp layla moran comes out as pansexual ms moran said she is weighing up whether she is the right person to take the party forward and might be ready by the summer when the leadership election will be held to make her decision she also opened up about her decision to come out as pansexual which was widely publicised at the time she told paul how after a lifetime of dating men to her surprise she fell in love with a woman but decided the term pansexual described her better than bisexual pansexual she says is very much about the person not about the fact that they are a woman or a man its not about anything that 's a physical attribute of the person it 's about the person inside jo swinson ' proud to lead party as she hints at future lib dem leader who will be the next lib dem leader after jo swinson loses her seat despite being a fervent remainer the 37-year old former teacher said if it was up to her she would not try to rejoin the eu the reason why i do n't think i would go immediately to rejoin now is that there is a huge amount of work still to do in convincing the whole of the country that that is where we want to go as a country she said she said she would call for a new referendum as soon as the country wanted to rejoin but said we 're probably talking a

news has obtained cctv footage of sudesh amman in streatham moments before he stabbed two people on sunday and was then shot dead by police the video shows amman 20 wearing a hat and coat and carrying a white bag walking down streatham high street other pedestrians can be seen walking several metres in front or behind him oblivious to the attack that was about to happen soon after the footage was captured amman had stabbed two people and was shot dead by counter - terror police amman had been released early from prison just 10 days before the attack despite reportedly telling a fellow inmate that he wanted to murder an mp he was sentenced to three years and four months in december 2018 for possessing and distributing terrorist documents but was freed automatically halfway through the new cctv footage comes as the government races against time to pass legislation to block at least six terrorists from being released automatically by the end of march plans to extend terror sentences certainly going to be challenged warns lord carlile streatham terrorist named as 20-year old sudesh amman i still feel like i 'm having to look over my shoulder former partner of sudesh amman speaks to itv news itv news political correspondent paul brand speaks on the government 's plans to push through anti - terror legislation officials have set a february 27 deadline to pass legislation that would ensure offenders serve at least two thirds of their sentence before they are considered eligible for release as many as 50 convicted terrorists could be released from jail this year according to the latest published figures it is understood one offender is due for release on february 28 with a further five expected to be let out in march itv news political correspondent paul brand reported that the person who could be released on february 28 was jailed for sharing so called islamic state propaganda online and calling for shia muslims to be burnt alive justice secretary robert buckland said the legislation would also require a panel of specialist judges and psychiatrists to approve each offender 's early release a whitehall official said the streatham attack highlighted issues surrounding terrorists with relatively short prison sentences there are n't too many terrorist offenders who will be in that similar kind of scenario to sudesh amman but if there are any then that 's too many and that 's what we are looking to fix the official said the government plans to introduce the legislation in the commons on tuesday next week with the aim of clearing the house by the time it rises for recess on thursday the bill will then go to the lords on february 25 with the aim of getting royal assent on february 27 on wednesday metropolitan police commissioner cressida dick said that while amman was under close police surveillance after being released such operations were not man to man marking they are there covertly and that is a deliberate thing it is inevitable that there could be a time delay before somebody totally unexpectedly does something she said i wish i could assure the public that everybody who poses a risk on the streets could be subject to some sort of thing that would stop them being able to stab anybody ever but it is clearly not possible there are at least 224 terrorists in prisons in britain with most thought to be holding islamist extremist views according to the latest figures metropolitan police assistant commissioner neil basu warned on wednesday the threat of terrorism to the uk is not diminishing the independent office for police conduct is investigating the police surveillance of amman boris johnson reacted to claims he was reviving his climate change denial beliefs by accusing labour of wanting to confiscate cars and scrap foreign holidays the prime minister sought to deflect queries and criticism from labour leader jeremy corbyn as the pair clashed over climate change at prime ministers questions mr corbyn raised the sacking of former uk climate and energy minister claire oneill as the president of the cop26 summit which will be held in glasgow in november as he warned the pm is failing so spectacularly to measure up to the scale of the climate crisis facing the uk and the planet he also noted two former conservative leaders have also turned down the job joking maybe it could be third time lucky as he suggested former tory leader sir iain duncan smith for the role who shook his head at the suggestion mr johnson hit back branding mr corbyns comments beyond satire adding this is the first major economy in the world to have set a target of carbon neutral by 2050 he said its an absolutely fantastic thing we are leading the world in our ambitions and we will have a wonderful summit in glasgow mr corbyn quoted ms oneills words in the commons arguing there has been a huge lack of leadership and engagement from this government responding mr johnson said if you look at what this government is achieving and already has achieved on climate change it is quite phenomenal he dismissed mr corbyns words saying all he would produce i m afraid is a load of hot air the opposition leader went on to criticise mr johnsons record on climate change telling the commons considering his monumental failure in advance of cop26 is nt it really just a continuation of his climate change denial statements that he was regularly making up until 2015 mr johnson said mr corbyn was talking absolute nonsense and defended the governments agenda adding we lead the world in going for a zero carbon approach his own approach is utterly unclear and has been condemned by the gmb as a disaster for the uk economy he would confiscate peoples cars and prevent them from having foreign holidays mr corbyn countered that the pm has a very vivid imagination adding unfortunately his vivid imagination seems to have taken over from his memory because he might recall saying that climate change is a primitive fear without foundation he later said the pm is failing on the biggest stage on the most important issue of our time before concluding when will he face up to the climate emergency and take the action necessary to turn glasgow into the turning point when this world will stop the levels of pollution and climate change were having and go forward to a sustainable future because his governments policies simply do nt take us there mr johnson insisted the government is showing world leadership on the issue jeremy corbyn has accused boris johnson of failing so spectacularly on climate change in a heated clash at prime minister 's questions and he went further accusing the prime minister of reviving his climate change denial beliefs and claimed he was previously a climate sceptic but the prime minister deflected criticism branding mr corbyn 's comments beyond satire adding this is the first major economy in the world to have set a target of carbon neutral by 2050 climate change again took prominence in the commons after former climate and energy minister claire o'neill was fired last week as the president of the of the 2020 united nations climate change conference cop26 which is due to take place

'm afraid is a load of hot air sacked ms o'neill heavily criticsed mr johnson 's approach to climate change saying he was miles off track in setting a positive agenda for the summit in november in a letter to mr johnson where ms o'neill reveals she was sacked by mr johnson 's adviser dominic cummings on friday she wrote you promised to lead from the front and asked me what was needed money people just tell us sadly these promises are not close to being met she added this is nt a pretty place to be and we owe the world a lot better mr corbyn noted two former conservative leaders had turned down

denied having been banged over a wheelie bin after she was criticised for wearing an off the shoulder dress in the commons tracy brabins remarks came after a twitter user shared a photograph of her wearing the outfit and asked is this really appropriate attire for parliament the shadow culture secretary replied to the tweet sorry i do nt have time to reply to all of you commenting on this but i can confirm i m not a slag hungover a tart about to breastfeed a slapper drunk just been banged over a wheelie bin who knew people could get so emotional over a shoulder ms brabin was raising a point of order in the commons on downing streets decision to order senior journalists from some of the uks major news organisations to leave before a briefing on boris johnsons brexit plans when she spoke at the despatch box wearing the outfit the president walked in to congress overnight to the euphoric cheers of a fiercely tribal and united republican party but the image that will ricochet around america was one of spectacular division the cold war between president trump and the house speaker nancy pelosi erupted into a fiery confrontation without them exchanging a word the two great antagonists in american politics did n't even try to hide their mutual loathing at the start the president refused to shake the extended hand of speaker pelosi a breach of protocol never witnessed in the house chamber in modern times at the end came a moment of even greater drama pelosi ripped up her copy of the president 's speech multiple copies for good measure it was an image that will surely come to define this era the question is what political damage that gesture will cause democrats millions of americans even in these venomous times expect the president or at least the presidency to be treated with reverence and respect that is especially true during a state of the union address the most formal occasion in the political calendar during the speech itself donald trump was in full triumphalist mode he was jubilant about the strength of the american economy and rehearsed lines we will hear many times on the 2020 campaign trail the divisions on display in congress reflect those of the country republican members of congress were chanting for four more years of his presidency democrats interrupted his speech with protests and the day of political drama in washington is set to continue at 4 pm eastern time today 9 pm in the uk the senate will acquit president trump at the end of his impeachment trial the great irony the reality that enrages democrats is that he has emerged emboldened and politically unscathed explained what needs to happen for donald trump to be impeached democrat candidate pete buttigieg has claimed victory in the iowa caucus even though none of the votes have been reported but who is the 38-year old hoping to become the next president of the us mr buttigieg is the first openly lgbt candidate to make a serious pitch for the presidency born in

his time on attempting to become the democrats ' presidential candidate confusion in iowa but two men emerge as serious contenders to challenge trump battle commences for the soul of the democratic

supports abortion rights has ambitious plans to combat climate change including doubling clean electricity energy in the us by 2025 supports supreme court structural reform and promotes a public option for health insurance mr buttigieg is a novice in terms of national politics but has proved a fundraising phenomenon the ex - serviceman is often introduced on stage by his husband chasten the son of joseph buttigieg a first generation immigrant from malta and anne montgomery a fifth generation hoosier a native of indiana state the former mayor left his small hometown for harvard university where he studied history and literature after securing a rhodes scholarship he went on to he study philosophy politics and economy at pembroke college oxford he returned to the midwest after graduating and worked as a mckinsey consultant but left to serve as an intelligence officer in the navy reserve in 2011 mr buttigieg ran for and was elected mayor of south bend and during his first

just tell us sadly these promises are not close to being met she added this is nt a pretty place to be and we owe the world a lot better ms o'neill also claimed the prime minister had not convened the cabinet subcommittee on climate change which he had promised to chair she added the government was miles off track in setting a positive agenda for the summit in november and that promises of action

audience we must reverse the appalling loss of habitats and species its only by repairing the damage to the natural world and restoring the balance between humanity and nature that is now so grotesquely out of kilter we can address the problem of climate change the un climate talks in november are the most important since the paris agreement to curb global warming was secured in 2015 pressure is also on countries to set out long term plans for cutting emissions with the science now clear that the world must reduce greenhouse gases to zero in a matter of decades to avoid the worst impact of climate change in her letter ms oneill suggested mr johnsons personal animosity towards scotlands first minister nicola sturgeon is endangering the success of the summit and claimed the prime minister is considering relocating the event to an english location because of ballooning costs ms oneill is also reportedly consulting lawyers about what she claims were false distorted and defamatory briefings about her record saying number 10 was rumoured to be behind the briefings she told the financial times she had been considered for a peerage by downing street to give her more authority in her un summit role but this had now been firmly rescinded video report and words by itv news correspondent rupert evelyn we have fished there uk waters for the last 400 years and we want to continue doing so for the next 400 years we do nt want give up one kilo says diek parlevliet chairman of the dutch fish marketing board as the uk and the eu aim to settle a fisheries deal its clear the dutch are not in a charitable mood at best they might maintain the status quo and continue fishing in uk waters at worst they fear access will be denied or limited and they will lose out visting the dutch port of den helder its clear they re nervous guido betsema has spent 35 years at sea he fishes for sole and plaice spending 80 per cent of his time in uk waters i m afraid that the uk say stop no fishing in our waters he d prefer nothing to change arguing that everyone in both the uk and eu is earning a living at the moment and there is no need to rock the boat what happens next for britain and brussels after brexit we meet skipper cor vonk with his crew as they are doing maintenance on his trawler his son is helping with the painting a reminder that although there are big businesses running fisheries much of the trawling is done on family owned vessels what would he say if he had a direct line to the uk pm boris think about the dutch think about our families its not a game we are talking about people beyond brexit what will change after the uk leaves the european union beyond brexit fishing farming and science set for biggest shake up in 70 years although the uk will get control over its territorial waters cor vonk believes access is about more than a line in the sea fish do nt have a border fish is for everybody fishing is a tiny industry that would barely dent uk finances if it ceased to exist and fishermen in the uk are worried they will be traded away by the politicians for more valuable industries what they want is a fairer share of the fish and anything other than would be unacceptable to the british fleet beyond brexit to what degree will vital trade routes be harmed as we leave we have had to give to our european friends for the last 30 years so maybe its their turn now to give a little bit back says barry young from the brixham trawler agents we do understand there will be some negotiations but lets not do it so the uk fishing industry suffers once again and we are sold down the river like a pilchard the problem is the dutch french & spanish do nt want to relinquish anything i asked gerard van balsfoort president of the pelagic freezer trawler association who represents eu vessels whether he was willing to concede any ground his answer was unequivocal no we are not we have a very simple message do nt change the current systems the pound has fallen more than 1 % against the dollar as fears among traders of a no deal brexit intensified following major speeches by uk prime minister boris johnson and eu chief negotiator michel barnier at midnight a pound was worth 1.318 dollars but by midday on monday it was down to 1.305 dollars a fall of 1 % the falls particularly hit from 10 am onwards as mr barnier laid out a draft mandate calling for reciprocal access for fishing vessels if a free trade agreement is to be signed eu and uk draw battle lines as goals for trade deal are set out brussels denies it has set any new conditions for free trade deal tusk eu would enthusiastically welcome independent scotland mr johnson later said he would be willing to walk away from the year long talks if the eu did not fall into line and agree to the uks demands he said there is no need for a free trade agreement to involve accepting eu rules on competition policies subsidies social protection the environment or anything similar any more than the eu should be obliged to accept uk rules investors has consistently warned against a no deal brexit with businesses concerned trade could be hit significantly britain leaves the european union currency markets which operate 24 hours a day tend to be a better indicator of business concerns in the uk because the majority of ftse 100 listed businesses are focused on international markets neil wilson chief market analyst at markets.com said the way the two sides have come out traders are starting to consider no deal risks again no deal is not the base case by any means but the eu and uk look in very different places right now at the start of talks its going to be a very long and rocky road to get there and the shape of the deal will hinge on some important concessions on both sides the british government has come out swinging over the weekend with plenty of fighting talk but they re up against a tough opponent ranko berich head of market analysis at monex europe added todays sterling price action has a feel of groundhog day signs of tension in eu uk trade negotiations have caused the pound to drop some 1 % today but on the whole although barnier and johnson have indeed set out markedly different visions for trade relations the uk prime minister was careful not to emphasise any of the sort of red lines that sunk his predecessors negotiations with the eu video report by itv news political editor robert peston boris johnson and michel barnier have set out their goals for a future trade deal between the uk and eu exposing a gulf that needs bridging before an agreement can be reached prime minister johnson says he wants a canada style trade deal with the eu but the eu is demanding the uk sign up to regulations on state subsidies environmental standards and workers ' rights the eu wants a level playing field and to ensure competition remains open and fair before such an agreement can be signed the eu 's chief brexit negotiator mr barnier also wants the eu to have access to britain 's fishing waters he says the uk must agree to these demands if it is to win a deal like canada 's which would remove tariffs on almost all imports and exports of goods brussels denies it has set any new conditions for free trade deal tusk eu would enthusiastically welcome independent scotland pound sinks more than 1 % against dollar over no deal fears caused by uk eu clash but mr johnson speaking in greenwich said there 's no need for britain to sign up to the full panoply of brussels ' regulations and insisted british fishing grounds are first and foremost for uk boats he told business leaders in london he 'd rather fall back on an australia style arrangement when the 11-month transition period ends rather than align with the eu 's demands the problem with mr johnson 's plan b is that australia does n't have a free trade agreement with the eu and critics have branded it no deal in all but name mr johnson said the question is whether we agree a trading relationship with the eu comparable to canada 's or more like australia 's and i have no doubt that in either case the uk will prosper mightily we will succeed boris johnson ushers in post - brexit britain he says he wo n't comply with demands on competition policies subsidies social protection the environment or anything similar because the uk left the eu to escape such regulations the uk should not be made to accept rules from the eu mr johnson said any more than the eu should be obliged to accept uk rules after the speech downing street said the uk will agree to some alignment with the eu as long as it is not overseen by the european court of justice ecj a spokesman said there is no need to go beyond the provisions set out in the comprehensive economic and trade agreement between canada and the eu boris johnson explains to robert peston why he will not accept eu rules the key point is nothing that involves ecj oversight and we do n't believe that there 's any need to go further than any of the provisions the eu has agreed with canada he said foreign secretary dominic raab said the government 's post - brexit global britain strategy will be based on three pillars of being a good ally a defence of free trade and doing good in the world in a commons statement mr raab said the first pillar of the strategy is to continue to prove that we are the best possible allies partners and friends with our european neighbours the next pillar is for britain to be an energetic champion of free and open trade to boost small business to cut the cost of living to create the well paid jobs of the future the final pillar aims to see the uk as an even stronger force for good in the world including a focus on human rights and climate change the foreign secretary also said he will visit australia japan singapore and malaysia over the next fortnight in order to discuss future trade arrangements robert peston is boris johnson the last blairite in britain brexit new era begins for uk after it leaves european union another trade deal expected to be discussed is one with the united states and despite a presidential election taking place there later this year the us ambassador to the uk believes there is time for a deal to be reached before president donald trump faces re - election asked by itv news political editor robert peston whether the us could focus on a trade deal before the november 3 election woody johnson said absolutely the president has made that point many many times about how important this deal is to him and the us he added i think you can get a deal if you have willing partners on both sides and you 're willing to get the emotions down and use your best efforts a deal can be done mr barnier warned that even if the uk and eu were able to agree a best in class trade deal it would still not be business as usual he said rules of origin and customs formalities would apply between the uk and the eu and access to eu markets would be subject to certification and market authorisation and supervision activities mr barnier said the more the uk was prepared to maintain common standards with the eu the higher quality access it would get to eu markets this will be up to the uk to decide will it continue to adhere to europe 's societal and regulatory model in the future or will it seek to diverge he said mr barnier said the eu would be clear headed in its negotiations with the uk brussels ' chief negotiator said our aim is to conclude an ambitious partnership with the united kingdom but we will remain clear headed the most ambitious partnership is the one that we had because we were in the same union he added when you are not a member of the european union then objectively speaking your position is different and less favourable meanwhile labour leader jeremy corbyn said any claim by the prime minister that a no deal brexit had been avoided should be taken with a massive pinch of salt the uk upon its departure from the bloc last week entered an 11-month transition period in which it has no representation in brussels but continues to follow eu rules while it works to agree a new relationship with the remaining 27 member states it might be march before formal trade talks between the two sides commence as the eu27 need to agree a joint position listen and subscribe to our weekly politics podcast

time in five years nicola sturgeon snp ready to ramp up case for better future with independence however a majority of scots surveyed also said they would not like to see another vote on the issue in 2020 or 2021 but most said they would like to see another referendum within the next five years mr tusk was initially reluctant to comment on scotlands place in europe saying he would like to respect the sovereignty of the uk a major issue during the brexit campaign he said i want to stop myself from saying something too blunt but sometimes i feel like i m a scot i feel like i m scottish especially after brexit but at the same time i know how important the word sovereignty and integrity were in the internal debate in the united kingdom i feel like it is not my role to intervene however the former polish prime minister did expand on his feelings towards an independent scotland and his thoughts on how other member states may react no alignment no concessions pm to reveal tough approach to brexit talks mr tusk said emotionally i have no doubt that everyone will be enthusiastic here in brussels and more generally in europe if you ask me about our emotions you will witness i think always empathy despite his claims of countries welcoming scotland in mr tusk said there would still be a process of application for any country to re - enter the eu he said if something like for example the independence of scotland happens then we need a regular process it would be a new process speaking on the same show foreign secretary dominic raab suggested other eu countries dealing with independence movements could be against the inclusion of scotland in the eu he said given the secessionist separatist tendencies in spain in france in italy i m not sure european leaders let alone here in the uk would actually welcome that kind of language in the 2016 brexit referendum 62 % of scottish voters voted to stay in the eu mr tusks comments come just days after the uk left the

putting down rigid red lines brexit new era begins for uk after it leaves european union brexit day in pictures the final countdown why we 'll still be talking about brexit until the end of 2020 the transition period explained it is understood mr johnson will put his cards on the table in asking for a canada style free trade deal with brussels and he is expected to make clear he will accept no alignment no jurisdiction of the european courts and no concessions to any brussels demands he will say he is not afraid to accept border checks the eu has been calling for a level playing field to be agreed pressing for britain to sign up to adhering to brussels set environmental and social standards as well as rules on state subsidies to prevent the uk undercutting the single market once the transition period ends in 2021 itv news political correspondent paul brand looks at what to expect from the upcoming trade talks there are only two likely outcomes in negotiation a free trade deal like canada or a looser arrangement like australia and we are happy to pursue both a government source told pa critics have hit out at the proposals accusing the mr johnson of adopting a scorched earth approach to the talks in a move that flies in the face of his pledges to unite the country after britains january 31 departure from the eu mr varadkar told the bbc 's andrew marr show one thing i 'd say to everyone is let 's not repeat some of the errors that were made in the past two and a half years let 's not set such rigid red lines that it makes it hard to come to an agreement and let 's tone down the kind of nationalistic rhetoric as is always the case when it comes to negotiations setting out so boldly such firm red lines actually makes coming to an agreement more difficult because the other party you are negotiating with does n't feel they got a fair deal unless those red lines get turned pink or bent in someway the prime minister will reveal his post - brexit vision next week in front of an audience of national and international businesses along with ambassadors to the uk from countries across the globe the eu is expected to publish its own negotiating mandate on the same day in preparation for the start of the formal discussions in march which will take place in both london and brussels november marks the deadline for finalising a deal with agreements on financial services and fishing due to be announced beforehand in june the tough approach to the talks from the conservative party leader means britain could face stunted economic growth and customs checks the so called canada model previously offered to the uk by brussels chief negotiator michel barnier as an off the shelf solution for a trade deal allows for almost complete tariff free trade in goods but entails some border checks and does not include the uks dominant services sector analysis undertaken by the treasury in 2018 predicted that britains economy would be 4.9 % worse off under such a deal within 15 years when compared with expected growth if it had remained in the eu government sources suggested mr johnson will state firmly that the nhs is not on the table in any trade talks and that workers rights food hygiene standards and environmental protections will not be relaxed the prime minister is set to announce that he has ordered his crack team of negotiators to pursue free trade agreements with the likes of the united states japan australia and new zealand at the same time as going back and forth with brussels mr johnson is expected to go so far as to name areas in the uk that would benefit from increased trans - atlantic relations with liverpool and glasgow said to be on the list foreign secretary dominic raab confirmed on sunday he will travel to japan and australia next week to work on agreeing trade deals and explore global opportunities for britain after brexit mr raab told sky news that michel barnier the eu 's chief negotiator was wrong to suggest that there would be border checks if the uk diverges from brussels ' rules the secretary of state said talk of checks was"directly in conflict with both the withdrawal agreement and political declaration agreed in october mr raab asked if mr barnier was wrong said yes he is wrong if the eu lives up to its commitment on its side both in the withdrawal agreement and also the political declaration he added we expect those assurances and agreements to be kept to that 's why we 've done this deal it is a package voters in the us are finally starting to have a say on which democrat

taken off them in a bid to solve the housing crisis labours emily thornberry has said in a fiery rant at the latest labour leadership hustings the shadow foreign secretary said there needed to be bigger stick with which to punish wealthy landlords who were content to let their properties sit vacant she told supporters in bristol it was a matter of inter - generational justice and that the uk was in danger of leaving a whole generation behind given so many young people could not afford to buy their own home as for all these empty flats for these people in china who think lets either buy a gold bar or buy a flat in bristol no she exclaimed you re not allowed to buy a flat in bristol as an investment and keep it empty if you keep it empty you lose it ms thornberry also said councils should be allowed to take back land from developers who fail to act on planning permission within five years of gaining approval the outburst came from ms thornberry as she seeks to claw through to

on the uks housing stock had been caused through a failure to balance the economy the wigan mp said some former industrial towns had homes boarded up because they were unaffordable which she said was a consequence of jobs having departed those areas and the young people with them the flip side is where are those young people going they re moving to the cities said ms nandy so we are overheating

acquittal the vote on allowing new witnesses was defeated 51 - 49 with senators voting mostly along party lines republicans susan collins and mitt romney voted along with democrats to allow witnesses but were not enough to sway the result democrats hit hurdle in call for more witnesses in impeachment trial it 's the first senate impeachment trial in us history to not involve calling witnesses senate minority leader chuck schumer said the trial was a grand tragedy america will remember this day unfortunately where the senate did not live up to its responsibilities where the senate turned away from the truth and went along with a sham trial americans will know this trial was not a real trial trump was impeached by the democrat controlled house in december on charges that he abused power and obstructed congress when he allegedly tried to pressure ukraine to investigate democratic rival joe biden then blocked the probe into his actions the democrats had badly wanted testimony from john bolton trumps former national security adviser whose forthcoming book links trump directly to the charges but bolton wo n't be summoned after the senate 's vote and his revelations will be unlikely to affect the trial 's expected outcome in an unpublished manuscript bolton said the president asked him to call new ukrainian president volodymr zelenski and persuade him to meet with trump 's personal lawyer rudy giuliani who was planning to coax the ukrainians to investigate the president 's political rivals bolton writes that he never made the call to zelenskiy after the meeting trump issued a quick denial i never instructed john bolton to set up a meeting for rudy giuliani one of the greatest corruption fighters in america and by far the greatest mayor in the history of nyc to

of eu political institutions but the country will for the most part stay within the customs union and single market that means british regulations will stay aligned with european ones for the rest of

britain has been freed up to make trade deals with other countries around the world there 's already talk of agreements under discussion with the united states and japan but it 's the future trade relationship with the eu that 's a big focus for government both sides have stressed a free trade agreement is the preferred way forward but there 's a lot of work to be done before december 31st march to december deciding the future relationship with the eu march 1st is the date the eu has set for sorting out its own negotiating position with its 27 member states after that the european commission and the uk will begin a long series of trade talks expected to last until november 26 a summit will be called in june to provide an update on trade talks it will also be the last chance the uk will get to request an extension to the transition process something that prime minister boris johnson has already ruled out asking for in practice this effectively gives the eu and the uk only six months to discuss a future trading relationship a time frame leaving some european figures sceptical irish foreign minister simon conveney said the uk was putting itself into a straitjacket by refusing to extend the transition process and was expecting a very intense negotiation ahead if the two sides ca n't work out a deal by the end of the transition process then britain will revert back to world trade organisation rules this outcome would be the same as a no deal brexit the snp is ready to ramp up its campaign to persuade scots to choose independence nicola sturgeon said as she accused the tories of goading scotland the party leader spoke in edinburgh on the day the uk officially leaves the eu which she said would be a moment of profound sadness for many ms sturgeon said a different better future is open to scotland with independence this could be nicola sturgeon 's time to act but what can she do democracy will prevail scottish parliament vote in favour of indyref2 she added our task is to persuade a majority of people in scotland to choose it our party campaign is therefore ready to ramp up we aim to double the snp campaign budget this year to support new independence materials local newspaper adverts and a new campaign film focused on undecided voters and it is vital that as we campaign we listen and engage respectfully ms sturgeon claimed there is no line boris johnson will not cross to prevent scots from having their say on the countrys future she said its not just his dismissal of election results in scotland and his derision at votes in the scottish parliament this week he described considered consensus driven scottish government proposals on migration as deranged the tories are not governing scotland they are goading scotland the speech at dynamic earth came the day after a yougov poll put support among scots for leaving the uk at 51 % pressure on the union has been mounting since scots voted to stay in the european union in 2016 the scottish parliament this week voted in favour of a second independence referendum is boris johnson the blairite who may not speak his name all the pm 's talk of levelling up rather than levelling down that is pure plagiarised blairism fixing public services like chaotic northern rail with a focus on what works rather than ideological attachment to private sector or public sector ownership on our politics podcast this week what happens after brexit day robert peston how will trump react to johnson blocking him over huawei how 5 g technology will help more than just communication in the uk that would be blairism mirrored inverted in the sense that blair 's mission with labour supporters was to make the case for the private sector whereas johnson needs to remove the stigma of public ownership for tories as for allowing huawei to own a third of new superfast digital networks more than a hint there of blairite triangulation in that by creating incentives and pressure to squeeze out huawei over time there is an attempt to reconcile the tories ' manifesto promise to roll out the new digital services as soon as possible with his tory colleagues ' anxieties about giving a chinese colossus such a pivotal position in critical infrastructure and conspicuously both talk up and talked up toughness on crime and on causes of crime though perhaps with differently calibrated weightings of importance if blairism meant anything it was the politics of not taking a side of keeping everyone in the tent of sidestepping the hardest choices johnson 's blairism is definitely bamboozling labour the opposition 's leading lights swing between accusing him of being the most right wing british pm ever which is frankly nuts to complaining he is nicking their ideas e.g. rail nationalisation of course this kind of political label never fits anyone immaculately not johnson who certainly made a divisive and real choice in leading the journey to brexit and not even blair during his iraq war years but for all blairs and johnsons mutual animosity over the uks relationship with the eu they have more in common psychologically emotionally in their broad political strategies then either would probably concede strikingly both also have the confidence to defer to their respective richelieus their senior counsellors and courtiers mandelson / campbell for blair cummings / cain for johnson there is also something eerily familiar about the way that johnsons aides are marginalising and disfavouring media organisations they see as the enemy it is all very campbell and mandelson even geopolitically in this almost post - brexit uk they share more than they would admit like blair johnson is setting himself up as a bridge between europe and us friend to each poodle of neither but here is the dilemma for the tory party people pleasing blairism delivered 13 unbroken years of labour rule from 1997 if johnson is the last of the true blairites maybe he will have a similarly long lived hegemonic reward but the newtonian reaction to blair was corbyn a loser of two successive elections the politics of not taking sides usually leads to a hunger to take sides as is now manifest in the labour party so there will ultimately be a price for the tories of johnsonian blairism but since it is probably years away they will pretend it does not exist calling peston the itv news politics

news correspondent ben chapman the political dramas of the last few years have provided plenty of watercooler moments by contrast brexit day itself feels like something of a damp squib in a county durham factory where they make the machines you will struggle to find many people who did nt vote to leave but the conversation around the watercooler development lab is about the anti - climax of 11 pm tomorrow night a moment of historic change when nothing really changes at least well have a new 50p coin jokes clyde welcome to the conversation brexit brings weariness to north london welcome to the conversation why ashfield ditched tribal voting to turn blue welcome to the conversation hastings and rye but there is a recognition too that entering a transition period is at least a smoother way to leave either way most people here are just relieved it is happening more than three and a half years since 58 % of people in county durham voted leave on the production line workers lament the many months of waking up to the brexit show on the tv and radio they are enjoying the commercial break in a process they know is far from over they helped it along by backing boris johnson last month electing a conservative in tonys blairs old seat sedgefield for the first time in 80 years its only surprising that no one quotes get brexit done as we wander round for the boss john elliott who began making dehumidifiers here before britain even joined the eu its a significant moment he was a vocal campaigner to leave and would gladly have walked away without a deal for him its the next 11 months of negotiations that will determine the real brexit but he is also adamant he will continue selling washing machines whatever the outcome life pretty much goes on he says for at least one of his staff things are nt quite that simple alex a team leader from poland questions whether she and her family will still be able to travel freely in the future is nt that what it was all about she asks her colleague who tries to reassure her but so many of her questions remain unanswered on the eve of brexit itself in a factory proud of its british made products few are celebrating a job that is far from finished if northern ireland could break away from britain what about scotland again brexit has made it more likely and a few days here it feels very real just as in northern ireland where 58 % voted to remain in the eu in scotland at the last election the 62 % vote against brexit has appeared to morph into a boost for the stop brexit snp sturgeon won 48 of 59 seats but whereas in northern ireland its a surreptitious slower burn of a debate in scotland its cranking up to full volume we joined the green party preparing their independence march on friday in glasgow seeing these guys unpack their independence leaflets i felt like i was in a neverendum they are choosing to mark the day we finally act on the result of a previous referendum by stepping up the fight for another one i remember spending a lot of time in scotland five and a half years ago during the first indyref then we were told it would nt be asked again for a generation then it ended up being 45 55 now reputable polls have it at 49 - 51 to no that is margin of error stuff most seemed to accept that it is neck and neck going in to a referendum with those numbers is a pretty good starting point for nicola sturgeon democracy will prevail scottish parliament vote in favour of indyref2 sturgeon urges scottish parliament to unite for a new independence referendum and indeed you can feel a palpable sense in scotland on the eve of brexit that this is a country right now that would like to cut its ties with the rest of the uk we spoke to quite a few people who said i was against it last time but now with everything that has happened of course neck and neck is nt the same as saying everyone is convinced we spoke to neil a student at stirling university who said he had been in favour but now he was against it that he lives in the highlands and feels most acutely that his familys fortunes are tied to trade with the rest of the united kingdom who knows where the current 50 - 50 would eventually end up in any referendum campaign the experience of the brexit campaign would suggest this is the snps to win but the debate about scottish independence was complicated and intricate last time round and that has nt changed the more immediate problem is how boris johnson is steadfastly perhaps some would say stubbornly denying her the section 30 she needs for indyref2 what to do about this intransigence from westminster appears to be a serious political dilemma for nicola sturgeon that is dividing her party she could wait until the holyrood elections next year and return another platoon of snp msps who have the clearest mandate yet for independence with some justification they say recent election results have already given them that mandate and at that point hope that boris johnsons refusal looks too heavy handed for him to keep up erm i do nt think looking heavy handed has ever really bothered boris johnsons team or she could go for a catalonian style informal referendum which is flawed too says emily st dennys of stirling university it becomes little more than a large opinion poll and its legitimacy will be questioned immediately if for instance remain in the uk voters decide to boycott it there is the legal challenge avenue but many fear that is tricky and time consuming there are some lawyers who believe that current devolved legislation gives the snp the right to ignore westminster already the point is right now no one knows why the rush well i think its because nicola sturgeon has a moment the future shape of brexit is unclear and scotland still feels defined by its 62 % desire to leave the eu and ignored and treated roughly by westminster leave it too long and the heat goes out of the situation or indeed whisper it quietly brexit ends up not being too bad for the people of scotland once the actual terms of the uk / eu trade deal are known independence might become a harder sell since it could lead to friction in trade between the eu scotland and a rump uk that 's why an snp msp wrote a piece suggesting their future should be independent but not necessarily in the eu scotland has a strong link with europe a lot of its business and agriculture supply chains are intertwined with the continent and since its population is older than the rest of the uk it relies on european immigration to sustain its workforce so westminster has much work to do to make sure scots come to like let alone love brexit even though it is nt clear how she gets her referendum nicola sturgeon will sense that her window of opportunity is now and that if brexit is a success independence will fall back in urgency nicola sturgeon will feel she has to act but no one knows how video report by itv news political correspondent libby weiner us secretary of state mike pompeo says the uk will be at the front of the line to secure a future trade deal between the two nations post - brexit as mr pompeo and foreign secretary dominic raab emphasised the bond of between the two countries at a policy exchange public sit down in london the uk 's decision to allow huawei to develop its 5 g network and the us refusal to extradite the suspect in the harry dunn death case could threaten to undermine relations mr pompeo also raised the issue of huawei with boris johnson at downing street making it clear washington still had deep concerns over the chinese firm 's involvement in britain 's 5 g development harry dunn raab expresses disappointment to pompeo over extradition rejection us working on harry dunn resolution following harry dunn 's death near an raf base last year the uk has formally asked the us to extradite anne sacoolas the wife of an american diplomat to face charges in britain however the us has so far been reluctant to extradite ms sacoolas mr pompeo expressed sympathy with mr dunn 's family today but refused to say whether she would return to the uk adding he was working towards a resolution that reflects the tragedy that took place he said this was an enormous tragedy an american had an accident here and the us is terribly sorry for the loss which took place it was horrible we 're doing everything we can do to make that right that i think protects the important relationship between the two countries and we will continue to work on this mr pompeo revealed the foreign secretary had raised the issue of harry dunn every time we 've spoken mr raab added we want to see justice done for the family and we want to make sure it will never happen again we want to see this get resolved uk at front of the line in trade talks with us with the european parliament voting overwhelmingly to approve the brexit withdrawal agreement bill on wednesday the uk is now set to leave the eu on january 31 and attention will soon turn to future trade deals britain has touted its relationship with the us as the pathway towards securing a trade deal once it leaves the eu and mr pompeo again reiterated a promise to put the uk at the front of the queue mr pompeo took a swipe against the obama administration with the former us president claiming in the run up to the eu referendum that the uk would be at the back of the queue should it vote for brexit the us secretary of state said the previous administration took the view that if the uk took this decision they 'd be at the back of the line we intend to put the uk at the front of the line this is a historic relationship between our two countries he added you talked about a trade deal we were just at a company here in the uk that has started in north carolina and has a huge operation here in the uk talented human capital and democracy are what brings people together to do great things together and our two nations share that uk us special relationship not at risk over huawei the us has been an outspoken critic of the uk 's decision to allow chinese tech firm huawei to play a vital part in helping build the country 's 5 g network infrastructure both mr pompeo and mr raab were quick to play down their difference of opinion but both stood firmly by their nation 's respective decisions with the strongest friends you have the strongest conversations and you have the maturity and the bandwidth to deal with the creases that come along with it mr raab said this is n't anything new if you look back to churchill roosevelt thatcher reagan it was n't all a bed of roses but actually if you have a special relationship you work your way through your issues mr pompeo added it 's your best friends you call up and ask what the heck are you doing it 's your best friends you call up and ask if you 're thinking about doing x y or z. you ca n't have those conversations without that deep relationship because if you do that with people you do n't have that relationship with you risk the relationship this relationship is not at risk the united kingdom left the european union at 2300 on friday january 31 brexit day it marked the end of more than four decades of partnership and the start of an 11 month long transition period which will see a new deal thrashed out much is set to change once that transition period comes to a close at the end of december 2020 but what about between now and then itv news consumer editor chris choi looks at how brexit will affect consumers what happens to my passports after brexit during the transition period very little will change in terms of international travel to the european union passports bearing the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland cover will continue to be accepted so long as they are in date there 's likely to be some confusion after brexit as to which passport booth britons should use until the end of december 2020 it 's fine to use the eu citizen gates as normal after the transition period ends this will change passports will continue to be valid until their expiry after brexit new passports are already being issued without the european union symbols on the cover the promised blue passports will start dropping through letterboxes across the uk later this year with all new applicants being delivered a blue passport by the middle of 2020 can i still use the european health insurance card after brexit like passports ehics will continue to be valid after january 31 some 27 million britons are in possession of one of the cards while the transition period is in place the cards which offer free state healthcare in eu countries switzerland norway iceland and liechtenstein will still be valid this is guaranteed until the end of the transition period the continuing status of the scheme after this date relies on how negotiations play out over the coming year but there 's a catch for those whose trip started in the eu before the date the uk leaves the trade bloc the card will still offer free healthcare after brexit even if the scheme ends the government has issued advice on healthcare in the eu after brexit advising people to buy health insurance like they would for a non - eu destination will i need a permit to drive in the eu after brexit driving in the next few months will remain unchanged until the end of the transition period after this ends britons may need an international driving permit and to display a gb badge on the back of their vehicle this will depend on the outcome of negotiations over the coming 11 months can i used my phone abroad after brexit british mobiles will of course still work in the eu after brexit but the price you pay to use them may change depending on the outcome of trade negotiations roaming charges may stay the same or soar but it 's looking positive for most travellers ee which is the largest uk network with 25 per cent of customers using its services has said it does not want to change the current rules much like the other operators in a statement on its website it said in the event of a no deal brexit ee will need to do individual deals with each of the 27 eu countries this includes 144 operators in total but we will continue to do everything we can to provide inclusive roaming for our customers in the long term the good news is we do n't want to change the eu roaming you enjoy today and we ve been having positive conversations with our european partners for over a year to ensure we can continue to provide inclusive roaming how will it affect my travel and holiday money currency will remain unaffected by the uk leaving the european union but the rate at which you are able to buy your holidays euros may change throughout the preceding brexit negotiations sterling fell to its lowest value since the 1980s but has continued to edge up and down as uncertainty about the future of the uk 's relationship with the europe continues it 's likely so will currency fluctuations without a crystal ball it 's impossible to say what will happen to the value of the pound after brexit what is likely to happen to house prices after brexit the governor of the bank of england has previously warned ministers that house prices could crash by more than a third in the event of a disorderly no deal brexit the september 2018 guidance came as senior ministers on the banks planning bodies were preparing for a cliff edge break from the eu interest rates may also change affecting the cost of mortgages what about bringing back cigarettes and alcohol back from the eu initially the rules will remain the same when travelling from the eu with the same limits in place until the end of the transition period some rules will temporarily change the government says but you ll still be able to buy duty free tobacco and alcohol when you re travelling to the eu officials say from the january 1 2021 you can continue to pay tax and duties on goods where you bought them and bring back an unlimited amount of most items including alcohol and tobacco will there be changes to living working and studying abroad in the short term not a great deal will change after the end of the transition period citizens living overseas will be able to enjoy broadly the same rights as they did before brexit providing they are living abroad by december 31 2020 the government says the withdrawal agreement secures rights and allows citizens to stay in the eu country where they live after 31 january 2020 it also says britons will have the same entitlements to work study and access public services and benefits as before the uk left the eu when it comes to the erasmus scheme an eu scheme which facilitates britons studying in the eu and vice versa it will continue until the end of the transition period funding for placements that overlap the end of the transition period will remain in place although there is no firm commitment to remain in the scheme the department for education has expressed an interest in continuing the scheme be wary of scams around brexit there is likely to be an increase in the number of companies trying to con britons out of their money as new legislation comes into place consumer group which is warning of an explosion of scams around ehics tax returns to hmrc and bogus brexit investment schemes the organisation warns people against making investments to capitalise on brexit or reduce damage as a result of it it says it has seen an increase in fake schemes like claims for a brexit severance cheque and warns people from making investments or divulging person details to cold callers britain has begun its last full day in the european union after prime minister boris johnsons brexit deal was given its final seal of approval british meps are packing up their offices in brussels and millions of new coins will go into circulation promising friendship with all nations as the country prepares to exit the bloc at 11 pm on friday it comes as mr johnson prepares to deliver a speech next week saying he is willing to accept border checks after brexit with sovereignty prioritised over frictionless trade the prime ministers speech will come in apparent defiance of eu warnings that britain must accept the blocs standards on goods for the best trade agreement the daily telegraph reports while citing whitehall sources there were emotional scenes in the european parliament on wednesday as meps voted by 621 to 49 in favour of the withdrawal agreement and linked hands to sing a final chorus of auld lang syne meps fight back tears and sing auld lang syne after eu parliament approves brexit withdrawal bill in contrast brexit party leader nigel farage had his microphone cut off during a fiery departure speech in which his partys meps cheered and waved union flags as he said the uk was never coming back speaking afterwards mr farage said the uk 's departure from the eu on friday the achievement of my lifetime political goal for most meps who have long wanted britain to stay it was a moment of deep regret addressing the parliament european commission president ursula von der leyen said she was determined the eu and the uk should remain good friends and good partners we will always love you and we will never be far long live europe she said the parliaments brexit co - ordinator guy verhofstadt said the departure of a country which had twice given its blood to liberate europe was a sad moment he predicted however that the uk would eventually rejoin with many british people deeply unhappy at the prospect of leaving so this vote is not an adieu this vote in my opinion is only an au revoir mr verhofstadt poured scorn on claims by supporters of brexit that it would mean britain recovering its sovereignty what is in fact threatening britains sovereignty most the rules of our single market or the fact that tomorrow they may be planting chinese 5 g masts in the british islands he said 46 m brexit information campaign had little impact says spending watchdog boris johnson britain will become global trail blazing country after brexit the vote in brussels follows the completion last week of the passage of the withdrawal agreement bill through the british parliament at westminster the agreement settles the terms of britains departure including future citizens rights the arrangements on the northern ireland border and the uks divorce settlement it also allows for an 11-month transition period during which the uk will continue to follow eu rules while talks take place on a free trade agreement mr johnson has said he wants a comprehensive deal covering all aspects of britains future relationship with the eu including security by the end of the year he has been adamant he will not contemplate any extension of the transition period beyond the end of 2020 but senior eu figures have repeatedly warned reaching such a wide ranging agreement will not be possible within such a tight timetable however sir robbie gibb theresa mays former communications director wrote in the daily telegraph he was confident that there would be no extension to the transition period and a basic free trade arrangement with additional provisions for the aviation and haulage industries would be settled fears that a deal will need to be ratified by every eu government are unfounded as the government believes it is asking for nothing more than already sits within scope of the european commission he added cherie blair said tokenism is a very negative thing when asked whether the next labour leader should be a woman speaking on the peston show the wife of former prime minister tony blair said she does n't think it matters whether the next leader is a woman role models do matter for sure but tokenism is a very negative thing so i do n't think it matters one way or the other whether the next leader of the labour party is a man or a woman mrs blair said what does matter is it is the right person for the job and the person who can turn the party outwards rather than inwards labour leadership hopeful lisa nandy would attend state banquet for donald trump james cleverly on racism i do n't actually agree that it 's getting worse labour leadership hopeful emily thornberry launches attack on corbyn 's advisers the barrister set up the cherie blair foundation for women in 2008 to help women entrepreneurs in developing countries become successful business owners but she said when talking about stereotypes women are treated differently to men mrs blair added this idea that a woman 's place is not at the forefront that 's a man 's place and woman who speaks out is therefore unnatural aggressive she was also quizzed on prince harry and meghan 's criticism of the british media and responded my husband always said complaining about the british media is like complaining about the british weather it 's not something you can change transport secretary grant shapps also appeared on the show in the wake of the government 's decision to nationalise northern rail mr shapps said he wanted to introduce a railway body as a successor to network rail there will be a national body who will be the organisation who are in control and they will decide how the investment works working with mayors regional leadership and the rest of it the transport secretary said it will be a much less fragmented railway its going to take time to do rail services operated by northern set to be nationalised this is a multi - year thing to put in place but we can start on it in fact have already started on it straight away asked if the northern rail franchise was now in the public domain for good said no its not but i m probably just less ideological than other people about these things i basically came to this job as a frustrated commuter what i want to see is the trains run on time and its clear that on northern and on some other networks this was just not happening cancelled delayed not running on sundays really an appalling service and i m just not prepared to see that continue the us warned huawei poses a real risk to security as boris johnson insisted allowing the chinese firm to be involved in the uks 5 g network would not damage transatlantic security co - operation secretary of state mike pompeo said the firm was an extension of the chinese communist party and washington would evaluate the uks decision mr pompeo has arrived in the uk for talks with foreign secretary dominic raab and the prime minister with the shadow of the huawei row hanging over them how 5 g technology will help more than just communication in the uk pm 's decision on huawei is infuriating the us the chinese tech giant has always rejected claims it represents a security risk but speaking to reporters on the plane to the uk mr pompeo said our view of huawei has been that putting it in your system creates real risk he added this is an extension of the chinese communist party with a legal requirement to hand over information to the chinese communist party he added that american information only should pass through trusted networks and well make sure we do that and suggested the uk could relook at the decision in the future the prime minister said allowing huawei to play a limited role in the uks 5 g infrastructure would not imperil our relationship with donald trumps administration as he faced a backlash from both tory mps and us republicans the prime minister defied the president by giving the green light to the chinese firm despite us warnings that it could hamper intelligence sharing with washington and the other members of the five eyes alliance mr johnson who spoke to mr trump on tuesday said the governments decision would not damage the extremely valuable security co - operation with the five eyes alliance which includes the us the decision has caused deep unease on the tory benches with discussion of a possible rebellion when the matter comes to the commons although the prime minister can normally rely on a comfortable majority the uks national security council nsc agreed on tuesday to allow high risk vendors to play a limited part in building the 5 g network at a 90-minute meeting defence secretary ben wallace argued against the move according to the times but was said to have been a lone voice senior tory mps including former leader sir iain duncan smith and ex - brexit secretary david davis are among those to express displeasure mr trump has refrained from a twitter outburst on the decision but officials in washington said they were disappointed by the uks decision there is no safe option for untrusted vendors to control any part of a 5 g network an official said a series of senior congressional figures spoke out to condemn the move tom cotton a member of the senate intelligence committee said allowing huawei to build the uks 5 g networks today is like allowing the kgb to build its telephone network during the cold war the european union also unveiled security guidelines for the next generation high speed wireless networks that stop short of banning huawei in a further blow to the us campaign against the firm mr pompeos two day visit is likely to offer the first real indication of the extent of any damage to the so called special relationship the us administration has consistently argued that giving huawei a role in 5 g could allow the chinese a back door into the telecoms network through which they could carry out espionage or cyber attacks the government has acknowledged huawei is not a trusted supplier but argues that by banning it from the most sensitive elements of the network and restricting its involvement to 35 % it can manage the risks the clash comes at a sensitive moment in us uk relations just as mr johnson is hoping to make rapid progress on a trade deal the pm appears to have concluded that honouring his general election pledge to level up the left behind areas of the country must be the priority rolling out 5 g across the country is regarded as key to improving economic performance and excluding huawei would mean delays and higher costs holyrood has endorsed nicola sturgeons calls for a second independence referendum after the first minister insisted such a vote is necessary msps passed a motion put forward by ms sturgeon calling for a referendum to be held so that the people of scotland can decide whether they wish it to become an independent country the motion backed by 64 votes to 54 now calls on the uk government to reach an agreement with the scottish government on such a referendum taking place on a date and in a manner determined by the scottish parliament democracy will prevail scottish parliament vote in favour of indyref2 nicola sturgeon warns pm he can not bludgeon scotland into accepting his view prime minister boris johnson has already rejected calls from ms sturgeonfor holyrood to be given the powers required to organise such a vote but with the uk due to leave the european union on friday something scots voted against in 2016 ms sturgeon insists there must now be a fresh ballot warning msps of the consequences for scotland of both brexit and a boris johnson government ms sturgeon said given what the tories have in store proposing a further decision on independence is nt simply legitimate it is necessary she accused uk ministers of being completely deaf to scotlands interests needs and voice adding their vision for the uk is driven by jingoism and xenophobia independence she argued would give scotland an alternative future the first minister said we stand just two days from losing our eu membership and all of the rights that go with it in my view it is beyond doubt now that the only realistic way for scotland to return to the heart of europe and to ensure we get the governments we vote for is to become an independent country she hit out at the tories labour and the liberal democrats for their opposition to a second ballot saying it is hard to escape the conclusion that it is their fear of the choice scotland would make on the substantive question that is driving the anti - democratic position of the opposition parties it is only ever parties that know their arguments are bust that have to resort to blocking democracy i know not everyone agrees with my position on independence but i am happy to have that debate and let scotland decide scottish liberal democrat willie rennie claimed the snp had learned nothing from brexit he added their answer to leaving an economic and social union of 40 years is to leave another closer more tightly integrated union too they are a party of barriers and division when we need unity and collaboration more than ever while the snp debate independence we are seeing health education and the police struggling to get by this is the true cost of the snps independence obsession pro - uk campaign group scotland in union branded the vote in holyrood an attempt to distract from the nationalists ' abysmal record running scotlands public services with hospitals in crisis targets to close the education attainment gap being missed and police stations falling apart chief executive pamela nash insisted the vast majority of people in scotland do not want a divisive second independence referendum scotland deserves better video report by itv news political correspondent paul brand in a candid interview for the acting prime minister podcast labour leadership frontrunner sir keir starmer has spoken on camera for the first time about the rare illness that left his mother unable to walk talk or eat the labour frontbencher told podcast host paul brand how he distinctly remembers as a school child spending nights in the high dependency unit as his mum battled still 's disease a condition that causes the immune system to attack itself for the last ten years or so of her life she could nt walk she could nt really talk eat or really move he said but she was very very determined from the moment she was told she was not going to walk again she decided she was going to walk again he says the experience of seeing his mother with still 's disease inspired him to be very determined himself the europhile mp also revealed how he 's in the dark about the future of his role as shadow brexit secretary when the uk leaves the eu on friday january 31 the department for exiting the european union will cease to exist and so will the role of his counterpart brexit secretary stephen barclay i keep asking steve barclay what he 's doing after friday sir keir said adding how his opposite number is n't sure what will come next he said his any new role largely depends where steve barclay goes and what department he goes to but sir keir knows what job he wants when the labour leadership election ends on april 4 he wants to replace jeremy corbyn opposite boris johnson in the commons and despite signalling he will adopt a similar stance to the current leader he refused to definitively rule out pulling the party back towards the centre he said the radical changes we have made since 2015 have been right but said the party 's current position would be a foundation block to build on labour leadership race lisa nandy joins sir keir starmer on final ballot starmer vows to protect labour radicalism as momentum urges long bailey support he added i m repeatedly saying that the shift we have made in the last 5 years is the right shift that the 2017 is the foundation document but we need to build on that for 2024 sir keir who has represented holborn and st pancras since 2015 also defended his pro - eu stance that led to labour adopting a policy which called for a second brexit referendum a plan that many say resulted in labour 's catastrophic election loss so it will come as no surprise that sir keir does n't plan on celebrating brexit day it wo n't be a moment of celebration i wo n't be marking it i accept what 's going to happen he said

the eu on january 31 more than 70 british meps will be out of a job so what will those meps do once they 've been given the boot from brussels while some weigh up their career options after more than 20 years as a european parliamentarian brexit gives green mep and former lord mayor of sheffield magid magid the chance to finish his new book and explore a new career path as a pro wrestler meps set to approve boris johnsons brexit deal in historic vote many people do nt know but i used to do mma i had the nickname magic magid the submission magician so basically i m thinking about looking into a career in professional wrestling mr magid told itv news i ve had a couple conversations with a few organisations maybe i could merge politics and wrestling together i 'm going to get this week out the way finish my book and then just lay down my plans for the rest of the year but wrestling is something i 'm considering seriously fighting and politics have a long history together whether it 's muhammad ali taking a stand against the vietnam war pro - trump ufc fighter colby covington donning a make america great again hat or boxer dereck chisora supporting the brexit party at the general election the two disciplines have gone hand in hand perhaps magid who wore a t shirt emblazoned with donald trump is a wasteman on daytime television could be the antithesis of colby covington fighting for the values of the eu and the greens magid laughs saying nobody likes that guy i do n't think i 'll be doing what colby does that 's for sure it 's just a different adventure and something i 've been thinking about i ve always been a wwe fan and there s a thriving uk scene and i just thought that possibly it 's something i could do i wo n't be an elected politician but saying that ill always have my hands in politics and activism the 30-year old has only been an mep for seven months but is grateful to have been given the opportunity to represent his home of sheffield and the yorkshire region in brussels there s a lot westminster could learn from europe but i m just trying to make the most of the last few days while magid has his regrets over the uk 's departure from the eu for lance forman it marks the start of a promising new future for britain the businessman who specialises in smoked salmon has reduced the price of his products by 10 per cent to mark brexit however the conservative mep he was elected as a brexit party candidate but switched allegiance revealed some customers have turned their back on his company owing to his pro - brexit views he said i suspect we ve had a few people who have come on board because they like my views but i would hope that with all this stuff is that the country can come together and get on together on what brexit can do for britain in the future mr forman is cautiously optimistic about what the future holds i do nt think it ll have an immediate effect but i think this is a new start britain i think we will do very well and while trade deals are helpful they are certainly not the be all and end all he added i m very excited and i think that there will be brexit jealously amongst the other 27 eu nations and they ll end up wanting to do to what were doing and it ll mark the end of my political career brexit may mark the end of mr forman 's political career but for lib dem mep shaffaq mohammed he 'll be turning his attentions to frontline local politics where he 'd typically spend four days a week away on eu business mr mohammed will have more time to focus his role as a councillor and youth worker in his hometown of sheffield i m not likely to be doing nothing shaffaq said i ve had very understanding colleagues i ve been multitasking recently because my life has got very busy with politics i ve had to reduce my hours as a youth worker i used to be a manager but as i got more involved with politics its hard to do both for me its an escape from politics this last week serving as an mep will be tinged with sadness for mr mohammed with meps delivering the final brexit vote to ratify the uk 's departure on wednesday we are about to walk away from something that 's very very special he said we 'll probably only realise what we 've done once its too late europe is moving forward it 's going to be a force for good not just here but across the world i 'm sad to see my country turn its back on its closest neighbour i really hope boris johnson and his colleagues have a long hard look about the direction this country is taking plans have been announced to introduce lie detector tests known as polygraph tests to assess if terrorists have reformed and no longer pose a risk but many disagree the style of testing first seen in 1921 is accurate enough to determine if a subject is lying director of ucl institute of cognitive neuroscience professor sophie scott told itv news you ca n't use a polygraph to work out if somebody is lying or not because actually there 's no one thing that people their bodies or their brains do when they 're lying that we can scientifically identify and say right then there a lie happened terrorists to take lie detector tests to prove they have reformed ahead of release polygraph which translates to many measures ' can note changes in a person 's heart rate their breathing and even how sweaty their skin is something the ministry of justice has used to check the behaviour of sex offenders since 2014 but scientists have never been able to say for sure if this data proves a person is telling a lie according to prof scott who has worked in the area for over 30 years i think the bigger problem is that while it may tell you that somebody is in an emotional state what it does not tell you is why they are in that emotional state there is often the idea that you could game this you might hold your breath or try and increase your heart rate some other way and i mean you could never rule out the possibility that somebody could do this currently the test can not be used in uk courts because of uncertainty around how accurate the results are but home secretary priti patel plans to roll the technique alongside increasing the number of counter terrorism probation officers providing specialist psychologists and training front line prison and probation staff to identify those behind bars and on licence the counter terrorism sentencing and release bill is in response to the recent london bridge attack committed by convicted terrorist usman khan who was out on licence from prison when he killed jack merritt and saskia jones however former head head of the national counter terrorism security office chris phillips thinks that these measures do n't go far enough mr phillips said i do nt think lie detectors on their own will ever be good we know they can be defeated everyone knows they can be defeated lie detectors are one tool in a big tool kit those other tool kits could be geo location devices and of course you can tag telephones to see who they re talking to and what they re saying so these are all just parts of a tool kit but of course all these things are only useful if you ve actually got the officers the people to do it and that s not always the case dissatisfaction with democratic politics reached the highest level ever recorded in 2019 a study has indicated researchers from cambridge universitys new centre for the future of democracy analysed a data set of more than four million people and found that satisfaction was at an all time low in large democracies including the uk america brazil mexico and australia the data set combines more than 25 international survey projects covering 154 countries between 1995 and 2020 with some dating back as far as 1973 and includes new cross - country surveys commissioned from polling firm yougov detailed stocktaking of global political sentiment began in 1995 meps set to approve boris johnsons brexit deal in historic vote johnson informs trump huawei will be involved in the uk 's 5 g network 46 m brexit information campaign had little impact says spending watchdog across the globe democracy is in a state of malaise said the reports lead author dr roberto foa from cambridges department of politics and international studies polis we find that dissatisfaction with democracy has risen over time and is reaching an all time global high in particular in developed countries the study suggested that dissatisfaction with democratic politics among citizens of developed countries has increased from a third to half of all individuals over the last quarter of a century it defines developed as citizens of europe north america east asia and australasia and all data presented in the report is from countries that are electoral democracies the downward trend in satisfaction with democracy has been especially sharp since 2005 which marks the beginning of what some have called a global democratic recession the report said some 38.7 % of citizens were dissatisfied in that year but this has since risen by almost one fifth of the population 18.8 % to 57.5 % in the uk the report shows democratic satisfaction rose fairly consistently for 30 years from the 1970s reaching a high water mark during the tony blair years at the turn of the millennium the iraq war and parliamentary expenses scandal caused dips but satisfaction plunged during the political stalemate following the eu referendum by 2019 for the first time since the mid-1970s a clear majority of uk citizens were dissatisfied with democracy dr foa said the rise of populism may be less a cause and more a symptom of democratic malaise without this weakening legitimacy it would be unthinkable for a us presidential candidate donald trump to denounce american democracy as rigged or for the winning presidential candidate in latin americas largest democracy jair bolsonaro of brazil to openly entertain nostalgia for military rule if confidence in democracy has been slipping it is because democratic institutions have been seen failing to address some of the major crises of our era from economic crashes to the threat of global warming to restore democratic legitimacy that must change professor david runciman head of the new centre for the future of democracy said we need to move beyond thinking about immediate crises in politics and take a longer view to identify possible trajectories for democracy around the world this means distinguishing what is essential to democracy what is contingent and what can be changed the centre for the future of democracy will be looking at the bigger picture to see how democracy could evolve the european parliament is to set the seal on britains departure from the eu in a final vote on boris johnsons brexit deal ensuring the uk will leave the bloc on friday with an agreement in place meps meeting in brussels are expected overwhelmingly to back ratification of the withdrawal agreement following the completion last week of the passage of the withdrawal agreement bill through the british parliament at westminster following the vote in the european parliament there will be a farewell ceremony for the british meps leaving for the last time it was formally signed by the presidents of the european council charles michel and the european commission ursula von der leyen in brussels and mr johnson in downing street pm seeks end to rancour and division after parliament approves brexit deal the agreement settles the terms of britains departure including future citizens rights the arrangements on the northern ireland border and the uks divorce settlement it also allows for an 11-month transition period during which the uk will continue to follow eu rules while talks take place on a free trade agreement mr johnson has said he wants a comprehensive deal covering all aspects of britains future relationship with the eu including security by the end of the year he has been adamant that he will not contemplate any extension of the transition period beyond the end of 2020 however senior eu figures have repeatedly warned that reaching such a wide ranging agreement will not be possible within such a tight timetable they have cautioned that the uk can not expect to enjoy the highest quality access to european markets if as mr johnson is insisting it refuses to align with eu rules after brexit with the uks instrument to ratify the withdrawal agreement due to be deposited with the eu on wednesday foreign secretary dominic raab said it would be a historic moment it is the start of a new chapter for an independent sovereign britain looking forward to a decade of renewal and opportunity he said whether we are reducing trade barriers between nations tackling climate change or improving lives around the world our vision of a truly global britain will be a force for good when we leave the eu on friday more than one border will be affected our team in northern ireland have been getting a handle on the enormous effect brexit has had on the balance of public opinion here for many of us it is the most enormous of questions whether southern and northern ireland could ever unite we thought it had been put to bed by the good friday agreement but after just two days on the border and in belfast it appears to be only sleeping first up carlingford loch the ferry between northern greencastle and southern greenore where businesses and day trippers alike travel between the two countries freely we spoke to irish hikers who had been up northern irelands highest peak slieve donnard that morning and were already on their way back into the republic a business woman and a grandmother who had just picked her daughter up from dublin airport all thought brexit had made a united ireland more likely one said she thought it would now happen in her life time another said that she could see it in the next ten years its brexit that has nudged people this way the withdrawal agreement creating a new border in the irish sea between northern ireland and the rest of the uk may see intrusive time consuming border checks boris johnson insists it wo nt michael barnier disagrees so lets see northern ireland also does more trade with the rest of the uk than ireland if boris johnson is right then perhaps brexit comes to pass and little changes but if it is the case that northern ireland comes to feel more economically unified with southern ireland than it does with britain then how long before it follows politically and constitutionally the good friday agreement requires the secretary of state for northern ireland currently julian smith to hold a so called border poll a referendum of both the irish and the northern irish if it looks likely that such a poll would be won this question of what constitutes likely when opinion polling is such a fraught business occupies some of northern irelands finest constitutional brains as we speak this mechanism was put into the good friday agreement to please nationalists but apparently at the time many never thought it would ever be used gerry adams had said in the previous brexit era that feels like a geological period in the past that a united ireland would nt happen in his life time but now in belfast many are discussing how it might be triggered sooner than expected academics and political pundits we spoke to said they thought things were moving fast the most conservative estimate was that it would be held in the next ten years possibly in five and one would nt rule out it being sooner than that the key thing is going to be the centre ground of northern irish public opinion there are hard rocks of opinion at either end of the debate the nationalists who will always want a united ireland and the unionists who will always want the link with the rest of the united kingdom but in between that the pragmatic centre ground of northern ireland is growing and in the words of alex kane who was an advisor to david trimble and former head of communications for the uup persuadable he has dedicated his life to keeping northern ireland in the uk but now thinks an all ireland could happen there is a demographic called small n nationalist small u unionist who are fairly comfortable in the united kingdom with this multiplicities of identities are protected by the european union and the link with britain and the link with dublin now they fear that identity is under threat being challenged and people who would nt have considered if you had asked them five years ago about an united ireland they would have said not now not now they are willing to listen to the argument and that is the big change professor katy hayward of queens university belfast agrees if this pragmatic group believe that brexit has damaged their jobs or local economy breadline issues then they will look to the republic of ireland 58 % of northern ireland voted to remain in the eu and they could come to see uniting with ireland as the way back in if brexit is a success the question will wither as the centre ground of northern ireland accepts the new arrangement remember too that northern ireland enjoys the nhs but the republic of ireland has a private health care system where people pay for appointments many we spoke to raised that unsolicited as something they would lose and not like losing in a united ireland it is not an uncomplicated prospect for the republic of ireland northern ireland is the poorest region of the united kingdom and academics have worked out this cost of on boarding absorbing northern irelands economy into the republic would be considerable were a way away from that yet people in northern ireland may be reporting thinking a united ireland more likely but it does nt mean they necessarily want it in great enough numbers but when that permanent brexit deal is struck northern ireland will be watching especially closely by itv news westminster producer lewis denison for boris johnson the benefits of rolling out the 5 g network across the uk must have outweighed the perceived risks of having chinese tech firm huawei help build its infrastructure despite warnings from us president donald trump and his right hand man secretary of state mike pompeo the british prime minister went ahead and approved plans which controversially allow huawei to play a role in 5g. if mr johnson is prepared to defy mr trump the 5 g network must be worth the hassle with huawei right why johnson defied trump dr victoria baines from oxford university told itv news the decision for boris johnson to allow huawei into 5 g would have essentially been a very sophisticated cost benefit analysis the risks as outlined by critics of huawei centre around the firm 's attachment to the chinese stage which has been accused of espionage critics say it would be easy for china through huawei to surreptitiously interfere in the uk 's affairs pm allows huawei into uk 's 5 g network despite us warnings robert peston how will trump react to johnson blocking him over huawei pm 's decision on huawei is infuriating the us but mr johnson trusts his security services are capable of nullifying the risks and to remove block huawei which is already involved with the 4 g network from all uk involvement would set back the roll out of 5 g significantly itv news political editor robert peston says if johnson kicked huawei out the uk then the roll out of 5 g would be set back by two years that of full fibre broadband by around four years and write offs for uk telecoms companies would run to billions the risk of delaying 5 g in the opinion of mr johnson at least must be dwarfed by what dr baines calls the absolutely huge benefits download and streaming speed for every day internet users the main benefit of having 5 g relates to speed as dr baines says that means the streaming of games and videos is going to be much more efficient than previously according to analysis from opensignal download speeds on 5 g can be up to 2.7x faster than 4 g so that likely means you can wave goodbye to online lagging the internet of things the internet of things is a term to describe a system of unrelated devices that are able to transfer data to one another in order to communicate it often relates to smart homes and smart appliances and 5 g is essential for making the internet of things work efficiently dr baines says 5 g technology will provide a leap forward in connectivity between the next generation of connected devices all of those sensors to our refrigarators to our doorbells to our transport systems they are all going to be able to talk to each other much more effectively and much more quickly with 5g. healthcare according to dr baines it seems as though even the nhs could benefit from the roll out of 5 g technology she says 5 g is going to massively enable remote healthcare which in turn could reduce the number of times we all need to go to the doctor due to faster download speeds remote appointments with your gp will become much more achievable and effective because streams will run more smoothly she suggests having more regular remote gp appointments could be preventing us from having more traumatic medical operations for instance there is a contradiction at the heart of today 's government decision to allow uk telecoms companies to purchase kit from china 's huawei for their 5 g and full fibre broadband networks it is that huawei has been has been officially designated as a high risk vendor because it is seen by ministers as subject to direction by an anti - democratic chinese government and its surveillance apparatus but despite pressure from president donald trump for huawei to be banned altogether from the uk 's digital infrastructure boris johnson and the national security council have not chosen to instruct huawei to pack up their hi tech kit and flog it in other parts of the globe instead they decided to give huawei restricted access to the new 5 g and super - fast broadband networks which johnson felt obliged to do because he is convinced that banning huawei would have set back the development of 5 g and super - fast broadband by two to three years at a potential economic cost of tens of billions of pounds or so officials informed him but huawei will not be allowed to install any kit in the so called core of these networks which is where most data is processed and important functions such as encryption of messages takes place how 5 g technology will help more than just communication in the uk what are the concerns over huawei and the uk 's 5 g network pm allows huawei into uk 's 5 g network despite us warnings also huawei kit will not be permitted anywhere near critical services like power stations or high security locations such as military bases but telecoms companies will be allowed to buy huawei equipment for up to 35 % of the non - core or peripheral parts of their respective networks which is where their most expensive investment is made because it includes all those masts and base stations that you see on top of buildings bus stops and lamp posts in theory this limit of 35 % and prohibition from the core should reduce two significant risks first if huawei equipment stopped working either as deliberate sabotage or by accident the uk 's critical digital infrastructure would continue to function though obviously at significantly reduced capacity and second china should not be able to harvest or steal either valuable big data or secrets from the uk because at the periphery this information should not be available to them and i should point out that uk security officials say they have never detected any malicious conduct by huawei in the uk via huawei kit already installed in existing networks so has johnson alighted on a compromise that will placate the american government and australia which has a 100 % ban on huawei and reassure senior tory mps such as iain duncan smith and tom tugendhat probably not although the us position will be seen by many as disingenuous because the digital channel of communication between the uk and us will remain wholly separate from any network where huawei kit is present the problem is that for 5 g important data processing such as for a new generation of driverless cars may well migrate outside of the core network to the periphery so if huawei were to want to harvest valuable data it could do so possibly so the uk 's world leading security operations gchq and the national cyber security centre will have to be vigilant to ensure huawei will not through stealth find its kit being used for critical and sensitive services which means that what really matters is that over time huawei 's share of the market falls and that can only happen if the government delivers on two important pledges to bring other equipment providers into the uk such as samsung and nec and maybe one day a british supplier and to make all equipment interoperable so that non - huawei kit can function if grafted on to equipment originally installed by huawei what the pm has in effect announced is that previous governments made a dumb decision to allow huawei to build such a big share of existing digital networks almost two thirds of bt 's and vodafone 's existing 4 g networks what he is trying to do is gradually unwind the effect of that decision without damaging the establishment of valuable super - fast digital services here but his plan thumbs the uk 's nose at donald trump who badly wants the uk to join with him in an economic war against china so johnson will be just a little nervous about how trump reacts to his twitter feed and diplomatic overtures being blocked johnson will expect to be trolled an australian style points based system would allow britain to control the number of people coming into the country after brexit but still welcome much needed professionals such as nurses according to the government the pa news agency asked dr alan gamlen an associate professor leading the human geography programme at monash university in melbourne australia and researcher at the university of oxfords centre on migration policy and society how such a system could work what is the australian points based system australia has what is known as a general skilled migration programme where immigrants applying for a visa are typically selected based on economically relevant characteristics such as education language skills and work experience this does not apply for refugees and asylum seekers and there are other visas available with different requirements like travel or holiday visas how does it work the exact way points are allocated changes depending on policy and the labour market but typically an applicant picks a skilled occupation from a list and needs to score a minimum number of points the visa application is submitted online after a series of checks and requires personal financial and contact details identity documents as well as education employment health and travel history for example at present an australian visa for a skilled independent migrant needs 65 points characteristics attracting the highest points include aged 25 - 32 years 30 points a superior level of english up to 20 points boris johnson ' rows back on tory pledge to cut immigration ' points based immigration salary threshold should be cut by 4,400 ' eight or more years of skilled work experience in australia = 20 points overseas = 15 points formal educational qualifications up to 20 points for a phd with more to gain if they had studied in australia extra points could be granted for translators interpreters or other things such as applicants whose partners meet the age english and occupation requirements how much does it cost fees vary depending on the visa but a skilled independent visa costs the equivalent of about 2,169 4,045 australian dollars most visas are processed within 18 months and allow applicants to permanently work and study anywhere in australia as well as sponsor eligible relatives for permanent residence and if eligible eventually obtain australian citizenship what are the pros and cons the points based system used by australia canada and new zealand all replaced colonial era systems that explicitly discriminated between applicants based on race and ethnicity dr gamlen said this system is considered fairer more objective and by capping the number of certain visas is thought to allow a country to choose what it considers to be the best immigrants and address staff shortages but critics complain the approach presents a narrow view of what constitutes a valuable contribution to a society dr gamlen added warning it could lead to brain waste with surgeons ending up driving taxis for example if there are not enough positions to fill how difficult could it be to bring to the uk it would involve some major changes to the uks current migration management systems which dr gamlen said have evolved in a much more ad hoc fashion than some other countries it would be difficult if not impossible to identify and transfer an australian model to the uk context and achieve comparable outcomes he said australias system involves long term data collection research and consultation the system there has developed over decades and continues to change so can not be simply transplanted to the uk he added would it make a difference introducing such a system would likely involve trial and error over a significant period of time for the uk immigration system to develop into something more like the australian system dr gamlen said he warned that it may not solve migration management issues nor will it be a simple plug and play procedure boris johnson has approved plans to allow huawei to play a limited role in the uk 's 5 g network despite security concerns from the us around the firm 's links to the chinese state mr johnson defied advice from donald trump in making the decision but admitted the firm was a high risk vendor downing street said the pair spoke over the phone and mr johnson updated him on the outcome of the uks telecoms supply chain review the prime minister underlined the importance of like minded countries working together to diversify the market and break the dominance of a small number of companies a spokesperson said in a statement announcing the decision the department for digital culture media & sport dcms said high risk vendors such as huawei should be excluded from sensitive core parts of 5 g and gigabit capable networks there was almost immediate retribution from the us with angry politicians from across the american political spectrum voicing their concern at the uk 's decision ex - republican presidential candidate mitt romney said the uk is sacrificing national security in its decision and democratic senator chirs murphy said it showed how the us had never been weaker president trump however is yet to respond how 5 g technology will help more than just communication in the uk robert peston how will trump react to johnson blocking him over huawei what are the concerns over huawei and the uk 's 5 g network the government says huawei 's presence in 5 g will be limited to no more than 35 % in the periphery of the network known as the access network which connects devices and equipment to mobile phone masts the prime minister made the decision following a meeting of the national security council and after receiving advice from the uk 's security agencies but he had been warned by us secretary of state mike pompeo not to let the tech firm play any part in the uk 's communications upgrade mr pompeo labelled the decision on huawei as momentous for the uk and claimed the country 's sovereignty would be put at stake if the firm was able to access its data but following technical and security analysis from the national cyber security centre the government is certain it can block any threats it said the implementation of a tough new telecoms security framework would allow us to mitigate the potential risk posed by the supply chain and to combat the range of threats whether cyber criminals or state sponsored attacks influential republican newt gingrich described mr johnson 's decision as a major defeat for the united statees sic he claimed the move to allow huawei into the uk 's 5 g shows the us is losing the internet to china adding this is becoming an enormous strategic defeat senator romney said the uk 's decision to incorporate huawei into its 5 g network is a disconcerting sign by prioritising costs the uk is sacrificing national security and inviting the ccp 's surveillance state in i implore our british allies to reverse their decision and liz cheney a congresswoman and daughter of former vice president dick cheney said it was tragic that the prime minister had chosen the surveillance state over the special relationship the concerns are shared across american politics with democratic us senator murphy tweeting america has never been weaker we have never had less influence not even our closest ally britain with a trump soulmate in downing street listens to us anymore and former tory party leader iain duncan smith agreed telling itv news the decision is a mistake we have a cyber war going on with china he said they are constantly trying to break into our systems it beggars belief that whilst we know they 're trying to mess with our systems as a nation why we 're using an organisation that itself has deep and strong connections to the government in china he added culture secretary baroness morgan vowed that upgrades would not be at the expense of our national security we can now move forward and seize the huge opportunities of 21st century technology she added huawei 's vice president victor zhang said the evidence based decision would allow the uk to have a more advanced more secure and more cost effective telecoms infrastructure that is fit for the future huawei is reassured by the uk governments confirmation that we can continue working with our customers to keep the 5 g roll out on track he said we have supplied cutting edge technology to telecoms operators in the uk for more than 15 years we will build on this strong track record supporting our customers as they invest in their 5 g networks boosting economic growth and helping the uk continue to compete globally he added but the ncsc stressed that it was important to avoid the situation in which the uk becomes nationally dependent on a particular supplier it added without government intervention the ncsc considers there to be a realistic likelihood that due to commercial factors the uk would become nationally dependent on huawei within three years tom tugendhat chair of the foreign affairs committee said there remained unanswered questions following the government 's decision to approve huawei a limited role in the uk 's 5 g network mr tugendhat who is campaigning for re - election as foreign affairs committee chairman said it would be near impossible to bar huawei 's 5 g equipment from sensitive geographic locations as stipulated by the government nuclear sites and military bases have been cited as areas deemed sensitive by the national security council mr tugendhat tweeted the exclusion from sensitive geographic locations ' seems near impossible to achieve in densely populated areas and in a world of mobile devices despite worries about security huawei is considered the industry leader in 5 g technology and is much cheaper than its european competitors ericsson or nokia and according to itv news political editor robert peston it is trusted by bt and vodafone two firms likely to be some of the biggest users of 5g. huawei is already involved in the uk 's network infrastructure and blocking it from 5 g is likely to cause a delay and add cost to the widespread introduction of the network in the uk a multimillion pound government information campaign appears to have had little impact on the publics level of preparedness for brexit the whitehall spending watchdog has found the national audit office nao said ministers spent 46 million on the get ready for brexit campaign ahead of the uks expected eu withdrawal at the end of last october the campaign was finally halted on october 28 three days before the uk was supposed to leave after the eu granted another extension to the end of january michel barnier frictionless trade impossible after brexit johnson britain will become global trail blazing country however the nao said that it was not clear that it had resulted in the public being significantly better prepared the campaign was ordered by boris johnson after he became prime minister last july with a promise to leave by the end of october do or die ministers chose the most expensive of four options put forward by the cabinet office with a total budget of 100 million of which only 46 million was spent the cabinet office estimated that it reached 99.8 % of the population with every member of the public having the the opportunity to see the adverts 55 times however the nao said the numbers of people looking for information about brexit did not notably change ranging from 32 % and 37 % during the campaign to 34 % when it stopped chancellor unveils new commemorative brexit 50p coin the head of the nao gareth davies said at short notice the cabinet office successfully corralled multiple government departments to work together effectively and launched this complex campaign at great speed however it is not clear that the campaign resulted in the public being significantly better prepared a government spokesperson said the get ready for brexit campaign reached 99.8 % of the uk population and the naos findings showed increased public awareness of the action they needed to take to be ready to leave the eu not undertaking the campaign would have risked significant and unnecessary disruption to businesses and to peoples lives frictionless trade after brexit will be impossible the eus chief brexit negotiator has said michel barnier made the comments to an audience at queens university in belfast just days before the uk is set to leave the eu the uk has chosen to become a third country to leave the single market and the customs union to leave behind the eus framework of common rules common supervision and common court of justice mr barnier said who s who in the eu the four key players in the next stages of brexit he adds it has chosen to create two regulatory spaces this makes frictionless trade impossible it makes checks indispensable speaking to politicians including former irish premier bertie ahern as well as business and community leaders mr barnier confirmed checks will take place under the brexit deal the uk will leave the eus customs union but northern ireland will continue to enforce the eus customs code at its ports unionists have spoken against checks taking place between goods travelling from great britain to northern ireland while there has also been widespread opposition to a hard border between northern ireland and the republic of ireland mr barnier said the eu must be able to assess risks on any product coming into its market we will need sanitary and phytosanitary checks on food products and live animals he said the eu must be able to assess risks on any product coming into its market and if necessary activate physical controls these checks must take place somewhere and as the whole point of the protocol is to avoid a hard border and protect the all island economy it was clear that they could not take place at the land border between ireland and northern ireland the only real option was to use northern irelands other entry points this is also where such checks are the easiest to implement and controls will also take place in dublin and other eu entry points mr barnier earlier met with northern irelands deputy first minister michelle oneill and the regions economy minister diane dodds he also visited belfast city hall where he signed a book of condolence for former deputy first minister seamus mallon speaking at queens later he welcomed the resumption of powersharing government in northern ireland following a three year collapse he said stormonts voice had been missed during the negotiations on brexit and northern ireland as brexit approaches mr barnier said it is now the eu and the uks joint responsibility to make this agreement work on the ground he said the eu takes this responsibility very seriously and lets be clear we have been creative and flexible in finding a workable solution but this is a detailed legal text now is the time to implement it precisely mr barnier continued the withdrawal agreement must be applied with rigour and discipline by all sides it can not be reopened under the guise of implementation we will be monitoring its correct application very carefully the eu negotiator concluded by saying he continues to have a profound respect for the uk that is why at the beginning of this new chapter of european history i would really like to wish the uk well speaking here in northern ireland as it embarks on this journey he said video report by itv news political correspondent daniel hewitt boris johnson has decided to allow huawei to be involved with the uk 's 5 g network after receiving conflicting advice on one side the prime minister had been told the technology firm is safe but on the other is the us which claims british sovereignty would be put at risk if the firm were to play a role in the uk 's 5 g infrastructure here 's a look at the key questions surrounding huawei and 5g. what is huawei chinese technology giant huawei is the world 's second biggest smartphone manufacturer and one of the world 's biggest suppliers of telecommunications equipment it says it is a private company wholly owned by its employees but questions have been raised about the mechanics of its ownership structure it was founded in 1987 by ren zhengfei who before his career in industry worked in the engineering branch of the people 's liberation army why is the company controversial huawei has come under scrutiny over allegations of close ties to the chinese state founder mr zhengfei 's past links to the military have been cited as a concern as has china 's history of state sponsorship and surveillance chinese law can also compel firms to co - operate with chinese national intelligence work which some critics have suggested could see beijing require huawei to spy on people through so called back doors in its telecoms equipment huawei has vehemently denied the allegations of any ties to the chinese state and says it abides by the laws of every country in which it operates why is huawei so important to 5 g huawei pm faces prospect of first commons defeat since election robert peston how will trump react to johnson blocking him over huawei boris johnson and trump discuss telecoms security as huawei decision looms robert peston explains why boris johnson looks set to allow huawei into 5 g huawei has invested billions of pounds into research and development around 5 g network infrastructure and as a result is now considered the industry leader in 5 g technology it is also already part of the existing network infrastructure in a number of countries including in the uk as a result using one of huawei 's rivals and most likely alternatives ericsson or nokia for the building of 5 g networks is likely to cause a delay and add cost to the introduction of widespread 5 g in the uk in contrast none of the four largest mobile carriers in the united states use huawei equipment in their networks how have the uk 's allies approached the issue the uk is a part of the five eyes intelligence network which also includes the united states canada australia and new zealand the us has previously banned huawei from its government networks and last year imposed restrictions which limit huawei 's ability to trade with us companies the us has publicly urged its five eyes allies to do the same and australia has also blocked huawei from its 5 g networks what does huawei say huawei has always denied having ties to the chinese government with the company 's founder denying that beijing has ever asked his company to help spy on its clients mr zhengfei in an interview last year said i love my country i support the communist party but i will not do anything to harm the world he said huawei had never been asked to share improper information about its partners by the government i personally would never harm the interest of my customers and me and my company would not answer to such requests no law in china requires any company to install mandatory back doors what does america say the united states has warned that british sovereignty would be put at risk by allowing the firm to play a role in the uk 's 5 g infrastructure us secretary of state mike pompeo described the choice facing the prime minister johnson as momentous in a last ditch plea to ministers who are expected to make the call on tuesday the us administration has previously urged allies in the five eyes intelligence community made up of the us uk canada australia and new zealand not to use huawei claiming it would be a security risk something the company vehemently denies mr pompeo who is due to visit the uk later in the week said the uk has a momentous decision ahead on 5g. british mp tom tugendhat gets it right the truth is that only nations able to protect their data will be sovereign he retweeted a comment by mr tugendhat chairman of the commons foreign affairs committee in the last parliament in which the mp said the real costs will come later if we get this wrong and allow huawei to run 5g. in an urgent commons question mr tugendhat warned that the uk should not be nesting the dragon if even the communist party in vietnam rejects it deciding to set up its own network and reject huawei perhaps we should beware of strangers and the gifts they bear he said washington 's ambassador to the uk woody johnson said mr tugendhat 's point was undeniable adding that doing 5 g right goes beyond data ' mitigation it 's about national sovereignty the huawei saga is explained by robert peston the calling peston podcast listen and subscribe on apple podcasts spotify or wherever you get your podcasts video report by itv news correspondent sejal karia private firms which refurbished grenfell tower have refused to admit any responsibility for the catastrophic fire that killed 72 people despite experts saying the work failed to meet building regulations the second phase of the inquiry into the blaze began on monday with the inquiry 's chief lawyer accusing companies of passing the blame on to each other rather than accept any responsibility richard millett qc said each core participant who played a material part in the refurbishment of grenfell tower has laid out a detailed case for how it relied on the work of others and how in no way was the work it did either substandard or non - compliant in every case what happened was as each of them would have it someone else 's fault he said the second phase of the public inquiry will examine how the 24-storey residential block came to be wrapped in flammable cladding which phase one of the inquiry found was the principal reason for the rapid spread of the flames richard millett qc during the second phase of the inquiry 's opening remarks lead refurbishment architects studio e said it had no knowledge the materials were unsafe cladding subcontractor harley facades said it did not choose the materials and main contractor rydon said its cladding and insulation providers arconic and celotex had mislead buyers into believing their product was safe for use in high rises despite appearing to be aware of the dangers an internal report from an arconic director in 2011 noted the material reynobond pe was dangerous on facades and everything should be transferred to fr fire resistant as a matter of urgency according to counsel for rydon marcus taverner qc the email sent by official claude wehrle added this opinion is technical and anti - commercial it seems mr taverner also read out an internal celotex email from november 2013 which showed officials knew using the insulation celotexrs500 alongside aluminium composite material acm cladding could be dangerous the email said we can not seem to find or design a suitable barrier in which we have enough confidence that it can be used behind a standard acm panel which we know will melt and allow fire into the cavity or do we take the view that our product realistically should nt be used behind most cladding panels because in the event of a fire it would burn the inquiry will hear from exova which gave fire safety advice arconic and celotex on tuesday the inquiry resumes two days after a newly appointed member of the panel benita mehra tendered her resignation after being linked to the charitable arm of the company that supplied the tower 's cladding she was the immediate past president of the women 's engineering society which received funding last year from arconic the supplier of grenfell 's cladding what happened on the night of the grenfell tower fire grenfell united a group representing survivors of the fire and relatives of those killed said they hoped the inquiry would expose those who authorised the devastating refurbishment of the building 's cladding between 2012 and 2016 those responsible continue to deflect blame and we have to suffer their persistent refusal to accept accountability for the preventable loss of life the group said at the end of this process it will be clear that criminal charges must be brought for the deaths of our loved ones a small group of protesters gathered outside the inquiry 's venue on monday morning

stepping down after grenfell criticism grenfell uncovered hundreds of children treated for trauma after the grenfell fire grenfell was built in 1974 but was significantly altered between 2012 and 2016 when combustible aluminium composite material acm cladding was added to the concrete exterior the first phase of the inquiry found the cladding did not comply with building regulations and was the principal reason for the rapid and profoundly shocking spread of the fire which killed 72 people the second phase of the inquiry will examine how the cladding products were tested and how the residents ' complaints to the tower 's management were dealt with it is due to run until june 2021 and more than 93,000 documents have so far been disclosed the inquiry said two cabinet ministers ' are at odds with each other over whether or not britain will align with european union rules post - brexit while the home secretary insisted the country will not align with eu rules the brexit secretary said the uk would not diverge just for the sake of it stephen barclay also said the government will publish how closely aligned with the eu the uk wants to be when it outlines its objectives as early as next month uk businesses are keen for more clarity on the alignment so that they can plan for the future the european commission president ursula von der leyen has warned that the uks

terms of divergence we are not having alignment we will be diverging we want to take control of our laws money and our borders and to do that we will not be rule takers we will be setting our own laws and that is a fundamental feature of leaving the european union however brexit secretary steve barclay appeared to adopt a softer approach telling bbc ones the andrew marr show were coming out of the single market were coming out of the customs union were not just going to diverge just for the sake of it we need to look at where the opportunities are but it is true that we are going to have control of our approach to regulation and that s the very essence of brexit that we can do things differently particularly where for example there is innovation there is new technologies there s things where we want to move quickly brexit at its very core is that we will have control of our laws our regulation and that is why we ca nt be a rule taker we need to have that opportunity he said the uks objective is to have a zero tariff zero quota ambitious trade policy but to do that in parallel in our talks with the rest of the world and in particular with the us boris johnson britain will

through communities that had lost so much to political violence mr mallon was a former teacher who lived in markethill co armagh a largely protestant town just before the 1998 agreement was signed he went to the houses of two lifelong friends from either side of the religious divide killed by loyalists in nearby poyntzpass and vowed to seal the deal he joined lord trimble at the scene as a reminder of how important it was to prevent that from happening again relations were later tested while in government by differences over the reform of policing but his unionist counterpart praised him for making and then implementing the agreement lord trimble said he had a lot to be proud of that is a huge achievement even though from then to now there have been huge ups and downs in the political system there has been no move away from peace mr blair said he was one of the most important architects of non - violence brave blunt often prepared to swim against the tide if he felt it right he was someone deeply respected and admired across the troubled landscape of irish politics tough to negotiate with but always for a purpose even occasionally fierce but always wise the sdlp spent the decades of violence advocating consensual constitutional politics in opposition to the iras bloodshed since 1998 it has been eclipsed in the political polls by sinn fein while mr trimble was

rancour and division of the past three years behind us and focus on delivering a bright exciting future with better hospitals and schools safer streets and opportunity spread to every corner of our country democrats in the united states have declared no president has ever abused power the way donald trump did in his ukraine dealings the comments come as democrats open their second day of arguments on thursday in the historic impeachment trial of president trump the house of representatives ' prosecutors are pressing their case before a group of sceptical republican senators and have begun by focusing on the first article of impeachment abuse of power they are arguing mr trump sought a political investigation from ukraine for his own gain to sway the 2020 election in his favour what is impeachment how does it work and could president donald trump really be forced out of the white house the presidents conduct is wrong it is illegal it is dangerous jerrold nadler chair of the house judiciary committee told the senators house democrats impeached trump last month arguing he abused his office by asking ukraine to investigate political rival joe biden while withholding crucial military aid they also charged him with obstructing congress by refusing to turn over documents or allow officials to testify in the house probe donald trump 's impeachment trial explained on the other side republicans have defended mr trump 's actions as appropriate and cast the process as a politically motivated effort to weaken the president in the midst of his re - election campaign the democrats ' challenge is clear as they try to convince not just fidgety senators but an american public divided over the republican president in an election year mr nadler told senators on thursday no president has ever used his office to compel a foreign nation to help him cheat in our elections prior presidents would be shocked to the core by such conduct and rightly so republican senators who hold a majority in the chamber and will vote on mr trumps conviction or acquittal exhibited no shock at the comments the top senate democrat chuck schumer acknowledged on thursday that many senators really do nt want to be here only if two thirds of the senate 67 senators vote to convict the president will he be removed from office as it stands the senate is made up of 53 republicans and 45 democrats with 2 independents who both caucus with the democrats trump sets presidential record for most tweets in a day once reluctant to take on impeachment during an election year democrats are now marching toward a decision by the senate that the american public also will judge meanwhile donald trump has continued to express his dissatisfaction with the impeachment trial on twitter mr trump blasted the proceedings in a thursday morning tweet declaring them the most unfair & corrupt hearing in congressional history back in the impeachment trial democrats are one third of the way through 24 hours of opening arguments campaigning in iowa to be the democrats ' presidential candidate mr biden said people ask the question is nt the president going to be stronger and harder to beat if he survives this yes probably but congress has no choice he said senators must cast their votes and live with that in history each side has up to three days to present its case after the house prosecutors finish likely on friday the presidents lawyers will have as much as 24 hours trump hires former lawyer of jeffrey epstein and counsel who investigated bill clinton it is unclear how much time they will actually take but mr trump 's team promises not only to defend the president but to take apart the democrats ' case the senate is expected to take only sunday off and push into next week brandon lewis the security minister is something of a genius at winsomely saying next to nothing even so i emerged from my interview with him on my show last night persuaded that the national security council and the prime minister would next week give the go ahead to the controversial use of huawei kit in the roll out of superfast 5 g mobile broadband it was something about the way he said that he utterly respected the advice of the security services and would take very seriously the evidence provided by bt and vodafone here is why this matters huawei executive meng wanzhous extradition hearing begins in canada us officials warn it would be madness to allow chinese technology giant huawei role in uk 5 g network the security services i understand have concluded that gchq and the national cyber security centre have the relevant expertise and the capacity to make sure that chinese agents provocateurs do not in any way undermine the security of the uk if it were to turn out that use of the chinese kit somehow gives them a backdoor either to eavesdrop or somehow to control a vital part of uk communications infrastructure so and i have this from multiple sources our own spooks believe they can manage and contain the risks equally there are powerful business and economic arguments being put to ministers by bt and vodafone who already use huawei kit in the existing 4 g network and in the case of bt in the existing fixed broadband network they use huawei and want to buy more because they say it is better quality and more advanced than the alternatives made by europe 's nokia and ericsson their principle argument is that if they are instructed by the government to eschew huawei because of the risks then the roll out of 5 g would be set back by two years that of full fibre broadband by around four years and write offs for uk telecoms companies would run to billions given both johnson 's general election commitments to accelerating the delivery of superfast broadband and the connection between economic growth and digital connectivity there would be significant costs for the pm and for the uk to banning huawei so why is prohibiting huawei even an issue well it is because the american government says that allowing a chinese actor like huawei to physically integrate highly sophisticated equipment into such an important piece of infrastructure would imperil uk security a delegation from the us came to the uk to argue that case a couple of weeks ago and us officials are apparently unimpressed by bt 's pledge to remove all huawei stuff from the core of its network and use it only in the less critical outer parts the point is that the us and the uk have intimate security relations through the five eyes alliance with nz canada and australia so us opposition could put uk security at risk if the us were to respond to the investment in huawei kit by restricting sensitive communication with the uk what is also relevant is that many years ago australia prohibited use of huawei network equipment by any of its telecoms companies so there is a huge amount at stake for the uk and for boris johnson in this decision which is why what lewis said last night in relation to having the deepest respect for the uk security services and for wanting to understand the arguments of significant uk companies matters what was also striking was that he did not push back when i said that there some evidence that what is really motivating trump is less the security issues and more the business battle between the us and china for superpower status in the tech industries here is where i suspect the argument will ultimately crystallise for johnson if a combination of our security services and our telecoms companies are saying that the huawei risks can be contained and the costs of banning huawei would be huge which they are then the prime minister risks looking to use his phrase like a vassal of the trump and the us if he were to ban huawei which he wo n't want to do however much he will rightly be wary of the inexorable rise of an anti - democratic china and its growing presence in the industries that underpin our way of life which is why i assume in this his first spectacularly important decision since the election johnson will gulp and allow huawei into 5g. listen and subscribe to our weekly politics podcast calling

inappropriate language mr bercow has consistently denied allegations of bullying from former members of staff in the past former black rod david leakey told itv news mr bercow would lose his temper adding he would descend into a fury of insults he would attempt to bully intimidate and harass mr leakey a former colleague of mr bercow said it would be totally absurd for anyone to think that he

arrangements when foreign dignitaries were making a speech when asked by itv news asked shadow foreign secretary emily thornberry if these allegations should disqualify mr bercow from a peerage she

system john bercows most controversial moments as speaker sir lindsay hoyle voted as new commons speaker in race to replace john bercow in 2018 former leader of the house andrea leadsom said claims of bullying were a huge concern and recommended a short independently led inquiry it followed a bbc two newsnight report which alleged mr bercow had shouted and undermined his former private secretary kate emms leading to her being signed off sick in a statement on thursday mr bercow said for the record i categorically deny that i have ever bullied anyone anywhere at any time addressing lord lisvane 's complaint in particular mr bercow added that the pair had worked together for five years and during that time lord lisvane had ample opportunity to raise any concerns about such conduct with me moreover as chief executive of the commons and head of the house service he had a duty of care to all house staff therefore he had not merely a right but a responsibility to act if he thought that he witnessed misconduct the simple fact is that he did not at any time do so even though he frequently disagreed with me on a wide range of issues he did not once complain to me and neither did

the us senate has begun hearing opening arguments in president donald trumps impeachment trial with proceedings now on a fast track democratic house managers kicked off proceedings by making their case that mr trump abused his presidential power and should be removed from office after late night deliberations over the rules almost ensured no new witnesses will be heard the trial picked up speed there were few signs of republican resistance to quickly assessing and voting on charges related to mr trumps dealings with ukraine senators rejected all attempts to bring in new witnesses including top aides of mr trump and are likely to do so again next week shutting out any chance of new evidence chief justice john roberts opened the session as senators settled in for a several long days of proceedings mr trump who was in davos switzerland attending a global economic forum suggested he would be open to his advisers giving evidence then quickly backtracked saying there were national security concerns that would stand in the way ill leave that to the senate mr trump said on the question of witnesses the trial marks just the third time the senate has weighed whether an american president should be removed from office democrats argue mr trump abused his office by asking ukraine to investigate political rivals while withholding crucial military aid and also obstructed congress by refusing to turn over documents or allow officials to give evidence in the house of representatives probe republicans have defended mr trumps actions and cast the process as a politically motivated

javid reiterated the uk 's plans to tax us digital giants such as amazon and facebook leading to treasury secretary mnuchin to respond by saying the us would install retaliatory taxes on british cars a trade deal with the us is seen of high priority for the uk post - brexit so a souring of relations would be less than ideal when it comes to business treasury secretary steven munchin called the arbitrary tax discriminatory us president donald trump is expected to further heap pressure on boris johnson to drop the tax but the uk has insisted it will implement the measure in april mr javid said the digital services tax will only be a temporary measure until an international agreement is in place on how to deal with online giants such as google and facebook but mr mnuchin was clear about washingtons opposition and said mr trump will discuss it with the prime minister mujtaba rahman managing director of eurasia group believes this is a sign of the complications involved in satisfying both sides in the long term mr rahman told itv news well it is indicative of the fact a uk us trade deal was never going to be easy to negotiate partly due to the substance but partly because of the mercurial nature of donald trump and his character very erratic very difficult to do business with the us and france have announced a truce over president emmanuel macrons plans to introduce a similar measure after washington responded with a threat to slap punitive tariffs on products including french cheese and wine but mr javid said the tax a 2 % levy on the revenues of search engines social media platforms and online marketplaces which derive value from uk users will be introduced the tax is expected to raise around 500 million paul brand discusses what happened in davos speaking at the world economic forum in davos mr javid said we plan to go ahead with our digital services tax in april its important as we said at the time when we first introduced it to parliament and legislated for it it is a proportionate tax it is a tax that is deliberately designed as a temporary tax it will fall away once there is an international solution the uk has been urged to hold back on the tax by the organisation for economic co - operation and development oecd which called for time to allow the international approach to succeed asked whether a post - brexit us uk trade deal will be possible if mr javid presses ahead with the tax a tory manifesto pledge mr mnuchin said we will be having some private conversations about that adding i m sure this will be worked out appearing alongside mr javid on a panel at the swiss ski resort mr mnuchin said i m sure the president and boris will be speaking on it as well as the president did with macron he said a digital tax is discriminatory in nature and the us is participating in the oecd process to find a solution if people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies we will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies he warned oecd secretary general angel gurria told the bbc that without a global solution to technology companies paying less than a fair share of tax there would be a cacophony and a mess of 40 countries going their own way with tensions rising all over the place the uk should absolutely hold fire and contribute to a multilateral solution he said mr javid said there has been a growing disconnect between where customers of online firms are based and where they are taxed this does require an international solution and that is something i think we all agree on he said while there is not an international agreement yet this could be the year of change the chancellor added downing street warned that a trade war would cause harm on both sides of the atlantic the prime ministers official spokesperson said our strong preference is for an appropriate global solution it has taken too long to address this issue at international level and so we will continue to introduce our digital services tax in april in the absence of a global solution the spokesperson added imposing additional tariffs would harm businesses and consumers on both sides of the atlantic video report by

getting out intro the country and laying out my vision for reuniting the party rebuilding trust and returning labour to power at the next election in an interview with itv news ms nandy was unable to pick a favourite former labour leader saying all of them in different ways the 40-year old highlighted clement atlee 's creation of the welfare state to help working people on a lighter note the wigan mp said she enjoyed listening to britney spears when she was not out campaigning and taking on battles how does a labour leadership election work here 's all you need to know starmer becomes first candidate on labour leadership race 's final ballot labour leadership race who are the contenders by winning support from three labour affiliates including two trade unions ms nandy was able to beat rebecca long bailey in becoming the second name of the ballot ms long bailey is likely to pass the threshold and progress in the contest but the task for emily thornberry is getting more difficult but she says she 's confident she will make it onto the ballot either by winning support from affiliates or alternatively by gaining backing from at least 33 local labour parties when leaving gmb hustings on tuesday she was asked if she is confident about being on the final ballot of course of course she responded ms phillips who quit the contest after failing to win sufficient support to progress further said she wants ms nandy to be the next labour leader because she can unite the party and begin the process of winning back trust with the country ms phillips who conceded she ca nt bring the party together told itv news she would be voting for sir keir starmer as her second preference on tuesday a member of ms phillips ' team revealed the birmingham yardley mp would do whatever she can to shore up the candidate who can beat rebecca long bailey robert peston what is lisa nandy 's claim to be labour leader if she makes it to the final ballot ms long bailey will be hoping the makeup of the labour membership has n't changed too much since it elected jeremy corbyn in 2016 she has been referred to as his continuity candidate and has the support of his right hand man in government shadow chancellor john mcdonnell if the membership is the same and feels the same as it did in 2016 then ms long bailey is in with a fighting chance of beating the race 's favourite sir keir however it is thought thousands of ms phillips ' 357,000 social media followers may have joined the party in order to support her if there are thousands of new labour members looking to mimic her voting intentions then the race could have a surprise winner in ms nandy earlier in the contest ms phillips appeared on the calling peston podcast in which she revealed she would support ms nandy if she herself was not in the race ms nandy was continuing her push for support on wednesday morning using a major speech in london to call for changes to tax and welfare policies tax is not an evil tax is how we contribute to something bigger better than ourselves she said the candidates have until february 14 to lobby clps unions and affiliates for support before the final decision is passed to labour

than give a damn about who runs the bbc and intend to have a significant influence over the appointment of a new director general the current chairman david clementi showed acute political sensitivity in persuading tony hall to stand down as director general earlier than he would otherwise have done the point is that clementi 's own term of office ends in just over a year and had hall stayed in post longer than that johnson and cummings would have selected a new chair to replace clementi with the express purpose of ensuring that hall 's successor would not be hostile to their ambitions for wholesale reform of how the bbc is funded and what it does under the rules the government chooses the bbc chair the bbc board chooses the dg so clementi appears to have won a tactical battle over downing street by taking control of the process to replace hall even so cummings and johnson have not surrendered and intend to have a voice here is what i know according to a well placed downing street source if the bbc 's board and clementi try to put someone like purnell in as dg we will put in a chairman whose first job is to fire him the likes of purnell would be dead on arrival this is a reference to the former labour minister james purnell who is the bbc 's director of radio it is not clear yet whether purnell is a candidate to succeed hall and what is more cummings and his colleagues are actively searching for possible director general candidates they regard as sympathetic to their aims for the corporation all of which makes clementi 's task all the trickier because although he is duty bound to protect the bbc from political interference and to appoint a director general perceived as best placed to protect the corporation 's independence he is also aware that the government has the power to significantly change the scope of what it does and how it is funded through future negotiations on its charter and licence fee for what it 's worth cummings ' and johnson 's views on what they think is wrong with the bbc are not exactly clear other than that they want big change they 've said they think non payment of the licence fee should cease to be a criminal offence and they have raised the question whether in the era of streaming netflix apple et al the bbc should move to a subscription model and away from being funded through what is in effect a poll tax i also understand cummings is convinced that the bbc can not keep on cannibalising everyone else 's websites which the bbc would furious deny that it does and then there is the thorny question of what the duty to be impartial means for the bbc 's important news service with the bbc and johnson completely unaligned on whether the corporation was impartial during the election all of which means clementi needs to find the broadcasting equivalent of henry kissinger to replace hall it wo n't be easy listen and subscribe to our weekly politics podcast calling peston available on apple podcasts

might have been between two candidates sir keir starmer and rebecca long bailey whose hands were well and truly in the blood of that disaster as part of jeremy corbyn 's shadow cabinet so the decision of the big gmb union to endorse lisa nandy will make for a more interesting contest and a proper choice for labour members nandy 's most important claim on the leadership is she is the only candidate to have argued as a backbencher that labour should have worked seriously to agree a brexit deal with ex - pm theresa may. it is highly likely that had corbyn achieved such a deal the tory party would have torn itself apart creating conditions in which labour might even have won a subsequent election boris johnson 's brexit deal defeated in house of lords for fifth time phillips pulls out of labour leadership race as nandy secures major endorsement starmer becomes first candidate on labour leadership race 's final ballot and if may 's brexit had been agreed the rupture with the eu would have been less severe than borisjohnson 's is expected to be which would have served the interests of manufacturers and their unionised employees so nandy has proved her ability to think strategically and in respect of the biggest issue of our times she also in securing gmb backing has shown she can play the political game that she understands politics is about backroom deals as well as ideals a bit like starmer she has been planning her tilt at the leadership in a quiet way for much longer than was widely known as i understand it she would never have entered the race if not hopeful she would get the backing of the gmb which ultimately turned out to be well founded labour leadership race who are the contenders to be clear that 's the big difference between nandy and phillips who is normally a superb public performer but who did not organise early enough or effectively enough and who counter - intuitively never took the policy risks that might have differentiated her from the rest it means labour 's members will probably face a choice between a young left winger long bailey who is still loyal to corbyn a world class technocrat in starmer who lost the argument that the uk should remain in the eu and a left wing voice in nandy who always eschewed the cult of corbyn and whose personal and brexit history provides some kind of connection with the voters in the midlands and north just snatched by johnson from labour all the signs are that those members will choose the candidate starmer whose sex background and ethnicity mean he could have been leader at any point in the party 's history but at least they now have options listen and subscribe to our weekly politics podcast calling peston available on apple podcasts spotify or wherever you get your podcasts boris johnson 's

could not be more proud to win the support of gmb which has edged her closer to the final ballot ms phillips in a statement announcing her decision to quit said the party needs a candidate that can

expected to be joined on the final ballot by ms long bailey who has support from the left of labour and lisa nandy who is seen to represent the party 's centre ground it is not clear at this stage

correspondent paul brand understands ms phillips will in fact support sir keir in the podcast ms phillips said she would happily serve in any of the candidate 's prospective shadow cabinets and said her preferred role would be home secretary had ms phillips made it to the final ballot it is not likely she would have had much support from labour members who joined in their thousands to elect jeremy corbyn in 2015 but it is thought dozens of ms phillips social media followers of which she has 357,000 may have joined the party in order to support her on the final ballot with their favourite candidate out the contest it is likely many of ms phillips ' supporters will back sir keir or ms nandy dealing a blow to ms long bailey who will be relying on the corbyn supporting membership ms

of the nations and regions he told itv news political editor robert peston that boris johnson would need to make scotland feel that they are a much bigger part of the uk if he is to unify the country the scottish ex - labour leader said mr johnson 's proposal to move the lords outside of london could be beneficial for the strength of the union but only if substantive changes were made to the constitution he said simply relocating the lords was not going to make a big difference because the nations and the regions do not feel part of this united kingdom he said if the relocation was combined with the creation of the senate of the nations and regions that unified the country by representing all corners of it then that would be a difference moving lords out of london is an option

institution does not cease to be anachronistic if it 's in another place but unchanged you 've got to change it he added mr brown says snp calls for independence have gained prominence because scots feel a remoteness and a distance from an over centralised westminster government he said that could be helped if more decisions were made by regions within the uk and suggested the formation of a council of the north the council of the midlands we have got to fundamentally change if we are going to make people feel comfortable within the united kingdom in the future he said he said brexit has helped the snp case for independence because leaving the eu involves powers being transferred from brussels to london and nowhere else they 're not going to be transferred up north either to the welsh assembly or the scottish parliament or the northern ireland assembly he said despite admitting the country is divided he claimed the snp 's terms for a referendum had not actually been met he said the party had spoken of needing consistent wins for the snp of over 60 % to show a mandate for a referendum and he claimed constitutional changes in the uk will soon make things in scotland move on from

from unatrac for use on road building to the north east of the country video report by itv news political correspondent paul brand the hs2 high speed rail project could cost as much as 106 billion according to an official government review not yet published the review led by doug oakervee a former chairman of hs2 reportedly says there is considerable risk that the projects cost will rise by up to 20 % beyond the 81 billion to 88 billion range set out in a report by current hs2 chairman allan cook just four months ago mr oakervees review says work on phase 2b of hs2 from the west midlands to manchester and leeds should be paused for six months to study if it could mix conventional and high speed lines according to the financial times which has seen a copy of the paper the review says the government should on balance continue with the 250 mph railway which would initially go from londons euston station to birmingham and then to leeds and manchester by 2040 but that this is subject to a number of qualifications warning that hs2 could exceed budget by 30 billion hs2 costs are out of control says review panel deputy chairman it says there needs to be further work done to assess hs2s impact on regional growth and it is hard to say what economic benefits will result from building it transport investment alone will not rebalance the uk economy the review adds prime minister boris johnson is expected to decide within weeks whether to go ahead with construction on the first phase of what would be europes largest infrastructure project the review said savings to the 106 billion figure could be made by having the private sector contribute to funding hs2 stations lowering specifications and improving the cost performance of the management it also says that no other high speed line in the world runs 18 trains per hour and recommends reducing it to 14 8 billion has already been spent on the hs2 project an hs2 ltd spokesperson said hs2 ltd is developing our organisation to make it simpler more flexible and more efficient as we move into the construction of phase one they added this work is entirely unrelated to and pre - dates the oakervee review and is standard practice for infrastructure delivery bodies as they move from the planning stage to delivery we will be working closely with the staff affected as roles and responsibilities change in every case we will first explore redeployment and mitigating options with redundancy as a last resort the house of lords could be moved out of london in a bid to reconnect with voters senior tories have said conservative party chairman james cleverly said the idea was an option being considered by ministers it has been suggested that the upper house of parliament could be transferred from westminster to york mr cleverly told sky news what we are looking at is a whole range of options about making sure every part of the uk feels properly connected from politics itv news political reporter shehab khan said a government source had told him that moving the centres of political power outside of london was part of the government 's agenda and that relocation plans are being considered the mp for braintree said when the pm stood up the day after the election and said this is going to be the peoples government he meant it that meant connecting people with government and politics the referendum in 2016 was nt just about our relationship with the eu it was about millions of people and their relationship with politics as a whole when pressed to say if the move would happen mr cleverly said we might its one of a range of things that we are looking into he added but fundamentally what this is about is about demonstrating that we are going to do things differently james cleverly on racism i do n't actually agree that it 's getting worse house of lords warned not to derail johnsons brexit bill zac goldsmith 's tweet on seedy peerage system comes back to haunt him in december the prime minister was criticised following the appointment of former mp nicky morgan to the lords in order that she remain in the cabinet former conservative mp zac goldsmith who lost his seat in the 2019 general election was also made a life peer international development secretary alok sharma welcomed the idea of relocating the lords speaking to the bbc he said i m not involved in the detail of it but actually as a principle as a principle its a perfectly good thing that we are connecting government to all parts of the country i mean my own department we ve got over 1,000 people based in scotland east kilbride were investing in that and i think its absolutely right that if you want to be a government of the people you must reach out to people across the country i am not going to lie i am bored sick with brexit like so many of you i have become that frustrated child in the back of the car moaning are we there yet boris johnson wo nt tell us or at least not in precise terms so on this marathon journey just days before we leave the eu in a legal sense at 11 pm on 31st january the final destination can only be deduced and certainly not with any precision what johnson says he wants more than anything is a trading relationship with the eu that returns to the uk a sovereign ability to set its own rules and regulations for business such as companies duties to employees their environmental obligations their safety standards and so on all this is implicit in the phrase which the chancellor in todays ft uttered as an echo of the pm that there will not be alignment we will not be a rule taker but it means as a senior member of mr johnsons cabinet told me there will be friction at the border we are under no illusion about that countdown clock to be projected onto number 10 to mark brexit this represents the victory of a kind of brexit purism vaunted by johnson and the brexiters of the european research group who carried him on their shoulders into 10 downing street over the compromise brexit initially negotiated by theresa may and championed by michael gove theirs was a brexit supposedly designed to half please the 52 % who voted to leave and the 48 % who wanted to remain in the eu may and gove lost the argument definitively and decisively johnsons general election triumph was an unambiguous mandate or so johnson believes and gove and javid concede for a literal version of taking back control it is important to spell out what this entails and where it does not necessarily lead it means that johnson will not agree to any legally enforceable mechanism for the uk to permanently follow standards set in brussels for chemicals manufacturers or food producers or car makers or the city or any other parts of the economy it means government and parliament will have the right to set laws and rules for every sector of the economy that means there will necessarily be checks at the border for compliance with eu standards which for some businesses car makers livestock and agrifood exporters chemicals manufacturers will be onerous some may well move plant and people across the channel to avoid the new friction at dover and calais it means the city of london will have to become more global and less eurozone focused it will bring costs to businesses and therefore to all of us as a result of reduced economic growth and smaller increments in tax revenues available to find public services than would otherwise be the case and for johnson those costs which he hopes will shrink as the uk reconfigures its economy to be more broadly international or more conducive to faster growing enterprises are the acceptable price of what he sees as a return to national self determination what it does not mean he insists is that the uk will use its enhanced sovereignty to weaken environmental and employee protections au contraire johnson insists you might ask what on earth is the point of taking back control if that control does not in practice lead to significant regulatory divergence from the eu and is very likely to make the uk at least a bit poorer for a few years it is an apposite question asked many times in the referendum campaign of 2016 and repeatedly since in the subsequent years intellectually it may still be credible but politically and practically that argument was lost when we went to the polls on 12 december the tory manifesto explicitly says no political alignment johnson is only doing what he said on the tin that said greater burdens for businesses trading with customers in the eu is not quite the end of it the uk has bargaining chips with which to secure limited trading privileges most notably access for french fishing boats to uk waters and since the uk will simultaneously be negotiating free trade agreements with the us japan new zealand and australia there are presumably ways of calibrating each treaty to better match the shape of our economy even so despite what many business leaders apparently believe johnson is pursuing a relationship with the eu by the end of this year that will be the untying of all apron strings no eu regulation alignment post - brexit warns javid big ben brexit bong bill ' 35 times more than cost for new year 's eve chime finally there is something else this so called proper brexit does not mean much frenzied speculation to the contrary namely that johnsons brexit uk will perforce find itself closer to trumps america than to the eu as one minister told me the choice is not binary between the eu and the us there will be times when we are more allied to the eu other times when we are closer to the us it depends on what the pm perceives to be the british interest in the non - economic sphere we saw that in recent days when johnson positioned himself with berlin and paris to put pressure on trump to dial down hostility to iran in the wake of the us assassination of the iranian general qasem soleimani lest we forget johnson is much more continentally european ethnically and culturally than any other recent prime minister so it is just possible that our journeys end will be an entente with the eu more cordial and stable than it has been for many of our decades as members of that club but we are not there yet listen and subscribe to our weekly politics podcast calling peston available on apple podcasts spotify or wherever you get your podcasts uk chancellor sajid javid has warned manufacturing leaders that there will be no alignment with eu regulations once britain 's exit from the european union is made official the treasury would not lend support to manufacturers that favour eu rules as the sector has had three years to prepare for britain 's transition mr javid said in an interview with the financial times there will not be alignment we will not be a ruletaker we will not be in the single market and we will not be in the customs union and we will do this by the end of the year mr javid said we 're talking about companies that have known since 2016 that we are leaving the eu there is concern among some uk business sectors about leaving the current trading partnership without a new deal to reduce border friction mr javid admitted that some businesses may not benefit from brexit but added that the uk economy would ultimately continue to thrive in the long term once we 've got this agreement in place with our european friends we will continue to be one of the most successful economies on earth he said mr javid will have the opportunity to sell his vision for britain 's economy post - brexit when he travels to davos next week for the world economic forum countdown clock to be projected onto number 10 to mark brexit day but the food and drink federation fdf said that no regulatory alignment with the eu after brexit could lead to price rises its chief operating officer tim rycroft added food and drink manufacturers will be deeply concerned by the chancellor 's suggestion that there will not be regulatory alignment with the eu post - brexit this represents the death knell for frictionless trade it will mean businesses will have to adjust to costly new checks processes and procedures that will act as a barrier to frictionless trade with the eu and may well result in price rises the chancellor also hinted that there might be tax rises in the march budget or autumn telling the financial times that he was determined to take the hard decisions you need to sometimes especially at the start of a new government but when asked specifically about taxation he said you 'll have to wait for the budget video report by itv news political correspondent daniel hewitt contenders in the race to replace jeremy corbyn as labour leader have called for unity despite jostling for position

wing would be leader shadow business secretary rebecca long bailey told the audience divided parties do not win elections itv news political correspondent dan hewitt is at the labour hustings in liverpool prominent backbench critic of mr corbyn jess phillips said the name calling within the party has been horrendous and called for labour to build a broad team shadow foreign secretary emily thornberry said labour members should stop fighting each other and concentrate on attacking the tories ms thornberry said being leader of the labour party in opposition is quite frankly the worst job in the world that s what we are applying for in the end we have to wade through an awful lot of shit shadow brexit secretary and early front runner in the campaign sir keir starmer agreed there had been too much division adding we are unstoppable when we are united ms phillips took a swipe at some her fellow contenders for keeping quiet over anti - semitism in the party she said the labour party needs a leader who has spoken out against anti - semitism and other forms of harassment in fact when others were keeping quiet and somebody who was in the room struggling for an independent system lots and lots of meetings i have to say i do nt remember some of the people here being in that particular room or being in those particular fights ms phillips said that the labour partys handling of anti - semitism had meant it had lost the moral high ground to fight racism she added jewish people were scared of labour winning the election that s deeply serious the labour party has now lost the credibility to handle its own complaints system we have lost the moral high ground to fight racism in this country because of the way we have handled anti - semitism the cost to make big ben bong to mark brexit night is more than 30 times the amount it cost for the famous clock to chime for new year 's eve mark francois mp has said the tory mp who has led the campaign to make the westminster timepiece chime to mark brexit said a parliamentary question he had answered on friday showed the cost was far less than the 500,000 previously stated mr francois said we now know that the cost is not 500,000 i 've had today answered a parliamentary question that says on new year 's eve and remembrance it was 14,200 on each occasion big ben bong bid set for defeat as pm focuses on official brexit celebrations he added so it 's patently obvious that the house of commons commission officials who never wanted to do this have quite delibrately inflated the costs 35 fold to try and con us this was an embarrassment it 's now turning into a scandal mr francois told itv news he was planning to refer the cost of the bongs between new year 's eve and brexit day to the national audit office nao so they could investigate he added the commons ' commission are embarrassed because the total cost of refurbishing the elizabeth tower has gone up from 33 m to 80 m they 've lost control of the project and they 've tried to divert attention away from that and that 's partly why they 've inflated these costs in the hope the whole issue will go away they 've been caught out and i 'm going to ask the nao to formally investigate the entire project an online gofundme campaign called big ben must bong for brexit has raised more than 200,000 of its 500,000 target in a statement the house of commons said the campaign to cover the cost of striking the bell was an unprecedented approach indicating that regulations meant the money could not be used for the purpose it was raised for the house of commons has well established means of voting through the expenditure required to allow it to function and to preserve its constitutional position in relation to government the statement said any novel form of funding would need to be consistent with principles of propriety and proper oversight of public expenditure big ben bong bid set for defeat as pm focuses on official brexit celebrations big ben ' unlikely to chime on brexit day due to cost but pm suggests 500,000 could be crowdfunded those who wish to celebrate britain leaving the eu hope to do so in the same manner as new years eve by looking at a clock the campaigns organisers wrote online the natural choice for this would be big ben but because it is currently undergoing refurbishment special measures would have to be put in place which could cost up to 500,000 a statement by standup4brexit founder rebecca ryan and mark francois mp added however because there is a lead time to make the necessary preparations we would need to raise this amount by this weekend mr francois had earlier accused the house of commons authorities of exaggerating the cost of bringing the bell which has been silent since 2017 back into operation in a video posted on the fundraising site mr francois said he is delighted to announce that our eurosceptic colleagues from standup4brexit have agreed to host a crowdfunding campaign to help raise half a million pounds so that big ben can chime at 11 pm on the 31st of january he added that the campaign hopes to get contributions from across the four nations of the united kingdom what the prime minister likes to call the awesome foursome mr francois said it is inconceivable that the clock used to mark the uks departure from the eu could be any other than the most iconic timepiece on earth which is big ben he finished his appeal by saying please give an amount an amount on this website now so we can properly celebrate becoming a free country again when the fundraiser passed 100,000 ms ryan and mr francois posted a message on the site saying they were very pleased to hear the leader of the house jacob rees mogg state this morning in relation to our campaign that parliament should nt look gift horses in the mouth they added that britons are currently donating more than 80 a minute to the campaign with an average donation of 16 the prime minister had said on bbc breakfast on tuesday that the government was working up a plan so people can bung a bob for a big ben bong donations to the campaign include 1,000 from mr francois while business secretary andrea leadsom promised 10 there were also small donations from dominic grieve jeremy corbyn and john bercow but these were all thought likely to be fake names restoring the bell was discussed at a meeting of the house of commons commission on monday but it was ruled out after it was revealed it could cost 500,000 commons speaker sir lindsay hoyle who is chairman of the commission said you are talking about 50,000 a

gentlemens club of politics by devolving power out of westminster while pledging to introduce a green new deal that unites labour heartlands where i grew up westminster even london felt like a million miles away she said the story of the last few years is that many people feel there is something wrong with their laws being drafted hundreds of miles away by a distant and largely unaccountable bureaucratic elite in brussels but ill be honest westminster did nt feel much closer and it still does nt today how does a labour leadership election work here 's all you need to know labour leadership race who are the contenders that s why i want to shake up the way government works and deliver a clear message to voters we will put power where it belongs in your hands the british state needs a seismic shock to prise it open at all levels to the people their knowledge their skills their demands ms long bailey said proper democracy takes power away from the offshore bank account and places it on the ballot paper so workers can have more and chief executives less and we can tackle the climate crisis with a green new deal that unites all of labours heartlands we will end the

party after securing the backing of the momentum campaign group on thursday though the result was not unexpected the left winger will now be boosted by the campaigning firepower of the group which has long supported the outgoing leader as she launched her labour leadership bid on friday ms thornberry will warn that labour faces a long tough road back to power after the party suffered its worst general election defeat since 1935 in my 42 years as a member of the labour party there is no fight or campaign our movement has waged where i have not been on the frontline and since coming to parliament 15 years ago i ve also been on the frontline in the fights against climate change universal credit and anti - abortion laws in northern ireland i ve led the charge as shadow foreign

was recalled from her post in may. the announcement comes days after lev parnas a former associate of donald trump 's lawyer rudy giuliani said he wanted to testify as part of the impeachment investigation into the us president parnas claimed the us president knew exactly what was going on regarding an alleged attempt to diplomatically pressure ukraine into investigating potential presidential rival joe biden and his son an allegation that led to mr trump 's impeachment the former us ambassador to ukraine marie yovanovitch was dismissed in may. the ukrainian interior ministry which runs the police forces said in a statement that ukrainian police are not interfering in the internal political affairs of the united states but the ministry said messages published by the us house intelligence committee contain facts of possible violations of ukrainian law and of the vienna convention on diplomatic relations which protect the rights of diplomats on the territory of another state our goal is to investigate whether there actually was a violation of ukrainian and international law which could be the subject for proper reaction or whether it is just bravado and fake information in the informal conversation between two us citizens the ministry said the interior ministry also said it has requested the fbi provide relevant materials in another move touching on the trump impeachment ukraine said it was opening an investigation into reports that russian hackers gained access to computers of the ukrainian gas company burisma hunter biden the son of trump opponent and former us vice president joe biden was on the board of that company the impeachment inquiry began with allegations that mr trump had tried to pressure ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy into investigating burisma by withholding promised military aid the fbi has been invited to take part in the burisma hacking investigation the ministry said ryanair has hit out at the governments badly thought out bailout of struggling flybe and demanded the same tax holiday for other airlines earlier this week the government announced it will review air passenger duty apd on domestic routes among other measures in an effort to help struggling airline flybe this prompted the owner of british airways to file a complaint with the european commission over the government bailout after its boss branded it a blatant misuse of public funds british airways and aer lingus owner international airlines group iag has written to the government accusing it of a lack of transparency and asking for further details on its involvement in rescuing rival airline flybe in a freedom of information request seen by pa and now ryanair has added its voice against the government subsidy for flybe claiming it can not comply with competition and state aid laws and called on chancellor sajid javid to extend the tax holiday to ryanair 's own business and its rivals in an open letter the airlines ceo michael oleary says as one of the uk 's largest passenger airlines we are deeply concerned and shocked by reports of your government 's bailout of flybe this week which distorts fair competition between airlines clearly constitutes illegal state aid and represents a badly thought out bailout of a chronically loss making airline model in the uk he adds flybe has been refinanced numerous times over the past 20 years for the sole benefit of its billionaire owners which he names as delta airlines sir richard branson and cyrus capital unlike flybe we all operate profitable business models without the benefit of being owned by billionaires like richard branson delta airlines and cyrus capital and we must be treated the same as flybe if fair competition is to exist between all airlines operating to and from the uk he added the prime minister 's official spokesman said on wednesday the actions we have taken will support and enhance regional connectivity across the uk so local communities have the domestic transport connections they rely on any changes implemented as a result of our reviews of air passenger duty and regional connectivity will apply to all airlines in the competitive aviation market boris johnson appears to have admitted defeat in his battle for big ben to bong for brexit downing street said the prime minister was focusing on official plans to mark 11 pm on january 31 the news comes as government sources hit out at intransigence from the commons authorities over the use of parliaments famous bell currently silenced while renovations are carried out big ben ' unlikely to chime on brexit day due to cost but pm suggests 500,000 could be crowdfunded the cost of big ben bonging for brexit has been estimated as up to 500,000 and already tens of thousands of pounds have been pledged by supporters keen to hear the bell toll on 31 january it comes after the prime minister had previously said he was working up a plan so people can bung a bob for a big ben bong to mark the end of the uk 's membership of the european union but the prime ministers official spokesman said the house of commons authorities have set out that there may be potential difficulties in accepting money from public donations they continued i think the pms focus is on the events which he and the government are planning to mark january 31 its a significant moment in our history and we want to ensure that s properly recorded the change in direction could be a result of what the house of commons commission called an unprecedented approach in attempting to fund the cost through public donation it added any novel form of funding would need to be consistent with principles of propriety and proper oversight of public expenditure commons speaker sir lindsay hoyle baulked

thursday he told mps one should n't look gift horses in the mouth he added if people wish to pay for things i think that should be considered as part of their public spiritedness rather than feeling that everything should always fall on the hard pressed taxpayer why does ringing the bell cost so much money bringing the bonging mechanism back testing it and allowing it to chime building a temporary floor to the belfry and removing it again would cost an estimated 120,000 delaying the ongoing conservation work by up to four weeks would cost 100,000 a week at that price it would cost

levels of funding around 3.4 billion for agriculture currently administered via the eus common agricultural policy for the length of this parliament environmental groups have welcomed the proposed legislation to support farmers and tackle the nature and climate crises but there were warnings that sufficient funding was needed in the long term to help nature and that british farmers and environmental standards must not be undermined in future trade deals with countries such as the us environment secretary theresa villiers said the bill would transform british farming and enable a balance between food production and the environment to safeguard the countryside and farming communities this is one of the most important environmental reforms for many years rewarding farmers for the work they do to safeguard our environment and helping us meet crucial goals on climate change and protecting nature and biodiversity we will move away from the eus bureaucratic common agricultural

sustainability wildlife protecting soils and flood prevention at the heart of land management we have trialled this approach with tenant farmers and we know that this model can work she said it must however be backed up with good quality advice and the certainty of long term funding that matches the scale of ambition in the bill shaun spiers chairman of the greener uk coalition said the government should be congratulated for resetting farming policy to provide more certainty for farmers and consumers ministers should now commit in law to the high environmental standards we already enjoy and make sure long term funding will be at the level the environmental crisis demands he urged kierra box campaigner at friends of the earth warned that uk efforts could be undermined by imports from countries that have lower environmental food and animal welfare standards the government must add a legal commitment to prevent trade deals from forcing lower standards on the uk tanya steele

and in the future and she said farmers across the country will still want to see legislation underpinning the governments assurances that they will not allow the imports of food produced to standards

in my younger years but also through invictus and all of the sporting events that i 'm lucky enough to be able to go to or watch the impact that it has especially on young people but the impact it has on the individuals playing with the community as a whole is remarkable not only do i continue to see sport actually changing lives but it 's saving lives as well so i think for me and everybody in this room whether it 's rugby league or sports in general it needs to be in everybody 's life if possible prior to the draw taking place harry who was announced as patron of the rugby football league in december 2016 watched children from a local school play rugby in the palace gardens harry had joked with the youngsters playing rugby telling them to look after the palace grass or he would get in trouble he told the children as they posed for the group picture some of you are really warm some of you have n't been running around as he headed inside he quipped look after the grass though yeah otherwise i 'll get in trouble harry chatted to the youngsters during a pause in their exhibition match and then the group posed for a photograph in front of a large group of photographers cameramen and journalists one of the reporters shouted out a question to the duke who has had a turbulent week trying to resolve questions about his future role in the monarchy the reporter asked how are the discussions going on your future harry who was making his way into the palace only smiled at one of his entourage and did not reply does meghan markle 's visit to vancouver charity offer a clue to what the sussexes ' transitional period will look like the personal rift between meghan and her father revealed in her legal case against the mail on sunday why do meghan and harry want to start a new life in canada harry was also introduced to two ambassadors for the global tournament england and leeds rhino wheelchair rugby league star james simpson and jodie cunningham who plays in the women 's super league for st helens the schoolchildren have been westminster champions in tag rugby a non - contact form of the game for the last three years mr simpson made harry laugh when he said we started without you in another sign that the duke is attempting to carry on as normal he launched the next leg of his invictus games for wounded and injured service personnel and veterans with an instagram video on wednesday evening which announced the event will be held in dusseldorf germany in 2022 harry 's official engagement on thursday comes as more was revealed about meghan 's stay in vancouver justice for girls a charity which focuses on issues facing vulnerable young women such as poverty homelessness and violence said that the duchess of sussex visited them on tuesday meghan markle visited to discuss climate justice for girls and the rights of indigenous peoples the charity wrote on their twitter page was great to talk about the importance of a holistic approach to social justice and the power of young women 's leadership the duke and duchess have also dropped their claim to be internationally protected people from their website indicating there may be an issue over their round the clock security funded by the taxpayer the classification entitled them to the same level of protection offered to heads of state but the times reported it was removed from sussexroyal.com a day after the new site was launched last week the royal rota our royal team on harry making his first public engagement since he and meghan dropped their bombshell conservative party chairman james cleverly has told itv news ' political editor robert peston he does n't think racism is getting worse in the uk speaking on itv 's peston show about allegations of racism in britain on social media he said i grew up against a backdrop of casual racism on the tv in society and we are an infinitely infinitely more open and tolerant country than we were in the 1970s ex tory mp goldsmith retains environment minister role as he 's made life peer tories sorry after mp was incorrectly named as first elected openly gay muslim when asked whether it 's getting worse again mr cleverly said no i do nt actually agree that its getting worse i think one of the things that we see is because of social media we are in problems and there are unfortunately always going to be problems but they get more exposure and that is probably a good thing he adds there will always be a certain degree of the fear of difference and unfortunately that does manifest itself in the terms of racism when asked whether he felt media coverage of meghan markle has a racist tinge mr cleverly also said he would n't know he said well i ca nt tell i ve not looked in detail at all the comments that have been made about the duke and duchess of sussex if anybody in society feels attacked and oppressed through racism that is something that we should address and that we should be conscious of he added i mean these are very very complicated issues and being a member of the royal family in the modern media age and against the backdrop of social media is going to be an incredibly difficult thing and i completely understand that it is not necessarily a pressure that absolutely everybody would want to endure however labour mp for nottingham east nadia whittome disagreed with mr cleverly about racism in the country not worsening and that it is actually on the rise ms whittome said that is not the case we only have to look at our own prime minister comparing muslim women to letterboxes saying he feels nervous walking past black men she added racism is on the rise and it 's being fuelled by people in positions of power meanwhile conservative mp tom tugendhat said he was not nearly as qualified to talk about racism as james is labour leadership hopeful sir keir starmer has set out his vision to return the party to power by making the case for a moral socialism that is relevant to everyday lives the shadow brexit secretary said on wednesday his vision is founded on economic social and climate justice as he highlighted his credentials as a former director of public prosecutions sir keir is among five candidates who remain in the race to succeed jeremy corbyn and is seen as the early front runner everything you need to know about the labour leadership election assault allegations as ex - mp vaz elected chair of constituency labour party in an article for the guardian sir keir said labour must use its time in opposition to fight boris johnson who he calls a prime minister with no conviction or principles we can win again if we make the moral case for socialism a moral socialism that is relevant to peoples everyday lives and the challenges we face as we move into the 2020s and 2030s the mp for holborn and st pancras continued there are three foundations to this economic justice social justice and climate justice mr corbyn set out a radical manifesto but has faced allegations he failed to relate it to the wider public as he led the party to its worst general election defeat since 1935 setting out his left wing credentials sir keir says that the free market economy has failed and has fuelled gross inequality as he called for a new economic model placing emphasis on the need to focus on the climate crisis he said the argument that something can benefit the economy while damaging the environment must end if its bad for the environment then it is bad for the economy he added he also called for a social security system that is decent strong and unbreakable with dignity at its heart and for radical devolution to nations regions towns and cities labour leadership contest all candidates through after clive lewis pulls out labour leadership race who are the contenders meanwhile fellow candidate lisa nandy was setting out her plan for the nation post - brexit and called for no trade negotiations with donald trump if he exits the paris agreement on the climate crisis earlier in the day she argued the pm should use negotiations to pressure the us president to stay in the accord to limit temperature rises to well below 2c this century mr trump has called climate change a hoax and is working to sever us ties to the key environmental pact but ms nandy believes the pms trade negotiations could halt this we should be clear now that we would refuse to agree any trade deal with a country that has not ratified the paris agreement she told the rsa in central london we must use trade to support climate action not hamper it she praised the eu and mr trumps predecessor barack obama as inspirations for using trade deals to drive up standards for people around the world asked about the ultimatum to the current president she rejected that the position would harm the economy saying the climate crisis was one of the greatest threats to the economy ms nandy who was one of labours prominent voices calling for a soft brexit after the referendum criticised mr corbyn and others in the shadow cabinet for the failure on the issue the trap was set you can be for your country or you can be for the world and senior labour politicians rushed headlong into it it was a serious failure of leadership she said long bailey gives corbyn 10/10 but says she is not his continuity candidate labour should have defended free movement and the benefits it brings ms nandy argued while recognising it has flaws and not dismissing concerns as simply racist anti - immigration sentiment if it were paired with renewed and radical investment that enabled opportunities for young people decent jobs training and skills then i know that those concerns about freedom of movement would have fallen away she added she said mr corbyn was completely wrong to call for dialogue after dawn sturgess was killed by the novichok russia is accused of using to poison former russian double agent sergei skripal hopefuls were trying to win the support of affiliates such as unions and constituency labour parties as the second stage of nominations opened on wednesday in order to progress to the postal ballot of members and supporters candidates must get

as an industrial washing machine salesman called jim at the time vaz was chair of the home affairs select committee which was examining the issues of drug use and prostitution vazs explanation which

correspondent john ray president vladimir putin has named tax service chief mikhail mishustin as russias new prime minister just hours after the previous government resigned the unusual resignation of the entire government was done to allow putin to enforce constitutional changes it is reported which would see future presidents restricted to two terms in office putin himself is currently serving his fourth term which ends in 2024 mr mishustin who is 53-years old has worked in the government since 1998 and has kept low profile while serving as the head of the federal tax service since 2010 mr putins choice of mr mishustin who lacks any political weight indicates that he will not play an independent role the resignations comes after a speech by putin in which he proposed amending the constitution to increase the powers of prime ministers and cabinet members the move is seen as part of putin 's efforts to carve out a new position of power for himself possibly as the next prime minster to stay at russia 's helm after his current term as president ends i know that in our society there are thoughts about the stipulation that one person ca n't stay on as president for more than two terms in a row i do n't think it 's an important manner but i do agree with this stipulation putin said in his annual state of the nation address putin thanks trump for helping foil new year terror attacks in russia moscow brings in fake snow after unusually warm winter russian news agencies said mr putin thanked mr medvedev for his service but noted that the prime minister 's cabinet failed to fulfil all the objectives set for it mr putin plans to name mr medvedev as deputy of the presidential security council reports said mr medvedev a long time close associate of mr putin 's has served as russia 's prime minister since 2012 he spent four years before that as president in 2008 - 2012 mr putin asked the member 's of mr medvedev 's cabinet to keep working until a new cabinet is fully formed tory mp dehenna davison says brexit party leader nigel farage should be made a lord despite his move to contest the conservatives for eurosceptic votes in the general election ms davison who is one of parliament 's youngest mps at 26 told itv news podcast acting prime minister she believes the eurosceptic deserves a peerage because of his great service to the country he 's done a great service for brexiteers certainly she said he definitely represents a pretty big sector of our society she told itv news political correspondent paul brand the house of lords is a great place for expertise and you ca n't deny that man has expertise when it comes to the european union in a wide ranging interview the newly elected member for bishop auckland also revealed what it 's like entering parliament for the first time and told of the awkward times she 's been mistaken for people much younger than herself rosena allin khan on a ministry of fabulosity and dissecting labour 's defeat she said the one person she 'd love to tell her experiences of parliament to is her father who tragically passed away when she was just 13 after he was the victim of a single punch during a night out at the pub she says 45 minutes after arriving at hospital to visit her dad the doctors came in and said they could n't resuscitate him and that was it which was awful it was so unexpected explaining what happened she said a guy had wandered across the pub punched my dad once hit him in the side of the head and it ruptured a blood vessel and that was it naz shah on her pain at suing labour and visiting her mum in prison mundell on softening his brexit view being sacked by the pm and coming out rosie duffield overwhelmed by heartbreaking responses to domestic abuse speech aside from her dad and her ferocious grandma who died in 2015 another person from whom ms davison takes inspiration is singer taylor swift but it 's not swift 's incredible incredible music that inspires ms davison it 's her political activism she 's become an advocate for lgbt rights and has n't been afraid to stick her head above parapet on that despite some of the abuse that she 's received sometimes from quite long

podcast on apple podcasts you can also listen and subscribe to the podcast on spotify scotland 's first minister nicola sturgeon has said scots will still get the right to decide their future despite prime minister boris johnson rejecting her plea for a second independence referendum she had written to the prime minister after her party the snp won a huge majority in scotland claiming there was now a democratic case for a new independence poll but on tuesday the prime minister flatly rejected her request for powers to be transferred to holyrood which would allow for a new referendum he told her he had carefully considered and noted the arguments she set out in her december 19 letter but said agreeing to her request would lead to continued political stagnation in scotland he told the first minister her predecessor alex salmond had made a personal promise that the referendum in 2014 which he lost by 55 % to 45 % was a once in generation event democracy will prevail scottish parliament vote in favour of indyref2 nicola sturgeon warns pm he can not bludgeon scotland into accepting his view mr johnson said the government would continue to uphold the democratic decision made by the scottish people and keep the promise made to them but ms sturgeon who has previously refused to rule out legal action in a bid to force a second independence vote said the scottish government would set out the next steps it will take before the end of january she said the scottish government would again ask msps at holyrood to endorse scotland 's right to choose the people of scotland will get the right to decide our own future in an independence referendum the snp leader said the westminster union can not be sustained without consent democracy will prevail the only question is how long it will take the tories and the rest of the westminster establishment to accept that inevitability michael gove one of mr johnson 's most senior allies in cabinet said ms sturgeon should concentrate on the day job rather than independence he went on the scottish government is failing when it comes to education health transport and crime what nicola sturgeon is terrified of is talking about anything other than independence she is a one club golfer a one trick pony whatever the question she always comes up with the same answer indyref2 the pm said a fresh campaign to separate the uk would see scottish schools hospitals and jobs again left behind he added the uk government will continue to uphold the democratic decision of the scottish people and the promise that you made to them for that reason i can not agree to any request for a transfer of power that would lead to further independence referendums responding to mr johnson via twitter ms sturgeon said the rejection showed the tories are terrified of scotland 's right to choose because she claims they know the electorate will choose independence the problem for the tories is the longer they try to block democracy the more they show the westminster union is not one of equals and fuel support for independence this response predictable but also unsustainable and self defeating scotland will have the right to choose scottish labour leader richard leonard said it would spectacularly naive to think mr johnson 's refusal to grant consent would close the issue down instead he said it would only inflame the debate about scotland 's future adding the people of scotland rejected independence in 2014 but scotland remains divided i believe that home rule within the uk is the only viable option that stands a chance of healing the divisions in our society we ca n't wait for a uk labour government to deliver this so we must demand it now and mobilise for radical change boris johnson acknowledged that the chances of the us sending anne sacoolas to the uk to face justice over the death of harry dunn are very low the us state department has said the extradition request for the suspect charged in connection with the death of the teenage motorcyclist is highly inappropriate the suspect the wife of a us intelligence official claimed diplomatic immunity after the collision and was able to return to her home country sparking an international controversy the home office said it submitted the request for anne sacoolas on friday after she was charged with causing the 19-year olds death by dangerous driving last month mr dunn died after his motorbike crashed into a car outside raf croughton in northamptonshire on august 27 last year the prime minister told bbc breakfast i think that it 's right that we made the appeal for extradition but he added i think the chances of america actually responding by sending anne sacoolas to this country are very low that 's not what they do home office formally seeks extradition of anne sacoolas over harry dunn death reacting to the prime minister 's comments from denver in the us the dunn family spokesman radd seiger said i do not know what is in the prime minister 's mind in making those comments because the parents and i have not yet had the opportunity to sit down and talk with him but we expect to do so within the next few days certainly if he is basing those comments on what is currently emanating from washington he may well be right he added the family will take things one step at a time and said his view on the chances of success is diametrically opposed to mr johnson 's if that is what transpires the campaign will swing into action deploying a number of measures including blockading the bases and will sit down with british officials to discuss what they will do not only on harry 's family 's behalf but the whole nation 's to ensure that justice is done and that no one ever suffers the same fate as harry he said that is not a sustainable position and i have made that crystal clear to the government and the point has been taken on board but we will take one step at a time and not get ahead of ourselves anne sacoolas will be coming back to the uk to face justice unlike the prime minister there is no doubt in my mind the us department for state has said it has always been their position that mrs sacoolas had diplomatic immunity stating that a request to extradite somebody with immunity would be an abuse a spokesman said the united states has a strong law enforcement relationship with the uk and in particular a strong track record of close cooperation on extradition matters but under the circumstances of this case they strongly believe that an extradition request would be highly inappropriate the spokesman added that they will continue to engage with the uk government and said they have been transparent on all matters both legal and diplomatic boris johnson said he did not envisage any escalation in the tensions between the us and iran and urged donald trump to produce a replacement for the nuclear deal the uk along with european allies has remained part of the troubled nuclear deal despite the us president 's opposition the prime minister said one of the problems the american leader had with the agreement was that it was negotiated by his predecessor barack obama so putting in a replacement trump deal would be a way out of the current crisis the us has pulled out of the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa which eased sanctions in return for iran agreeing to restrictions on its activity in an effort to ensure tehran did not acquire a nuclear weapon the uk and european allies have publicly remained committed to the approach despite breaches by iran and the difficulties caused by mr trump 's decision to walk away mr johnson told bbc breakfast if we are going to get rid of it then we need a replacement the problem with the jcpoa this is the crucial thing it 's why there is this tension the problem with the agreement is that from the american perspective it 's a flawed agreement it expires plus it was negotiated by president obama from their point of view it has many many faults if we are going to get rid of it let 's replace it and let 's replace it with the trump deal that 's what we need to see i think that would be a great way forward president trump is a great deal maker by his own account and many others let 's work together to replace the jcpoa and get the trump deal instead arrest of uk ambassador in iran was flagrant violation of law iran admits it unintentionally shot down ukrainian plane the prime minister said he did not envisage any escalation in the tensions between the us and iran adding let 's dial this thing down in an interview with bbc breakfast the prime minister said he was glad iran had acknowledged it made a terrible mistake in shooting down the ukrainian passenger plane last week his comments came shortly after iran 's president announced arrests have been made over the incident and called for a special court to investigate mr johnson said the next step was to repatriate in a dignified way the britons who had lost their lives in the tragedy he said i 'm glad the iranians have accepted responsibility and identified it as an appalling mistake and it does appear that it was a mistake it is very important that the bodies are repatriated in a dignified way and that the families are allowed to grieve and to have closure clearly as president rouhani has said iran made a terrible mistake it is good they have apologised the most important thing now is that tensions in the region calm down the prime minister also defended his role during the tensions with iran after facing criticism for not returning from his holiday immediately i was not in this country but i worked very hard as you can imagine in making sure there was a european response he said mr johnson said britain had played its traditional role in serving as the bridge between the european powers and the united states he said there was no need for britain to have been informed before the attack this was not our operation there was no reason for us to be told meanwhile iran 's judiciary said on tuesday arrests have been made over the accidental shootdown the announcement came shortly after iran 's president called for a special court to be set up to probe the downing last week of the plane by iranian forces judiciary spokesman gholamhossein esmaili was quoted by iranian state media saying extensive investigations have taken place and some individuals are arrested he did not say how many individuals have been detained or name them iran which initially dismissed allegations that a missile had brought down the jetliner acknowledged three days after wednesday 's downing and in the face of mounting evidence that its revolutionary guard had shot down the ukrainian plane by mistake the judiciary should form a special court with a ranking judge and dozens of experts president hassan rouhani said in a speech televised in iran this is not an ordinary case the entire the world will be watching this court rouhani called the incident a painful and unforgivable mistake and promised that his administration would pursue the case by all means the responsibility falls on more than just one person he said adding that those found culpable should be punished rouhani called the government 's admission that iranian forces shot down the plane the first good step the plane en route to the ukrainian capital of kyiv was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries including 82 iranians 57 canadians including many iranians with dual citizenship and 11 ukrainians according to officials there were several children among the passengers including an infant iran shot down the plane when it was bracing for possible us retaliation for a ballistic missile attack on two military bases housing us troops in iraq no one was hurt in that attack which was carried out to avenge the stunning killing of revolutionary guard gen. qassem soleimani in an american airstrike in baghdad the shootdown and the lack of transparency around it has reignited anger in iran at the country leadership with protesters taking to the streets online videos appeared to show security forces firing live ammunition and tear gas to disperse protests in the streets iranian actress taraneh alidoosti has spoken out against her country 's regime in a instagram post to her six million followers i fought for this dream for

agreement over the line mr smith who helped broker the deal pledged major investment to alleviate problems in the regions struggling public services but declined to confirm the sums involved until a devolution was restored ministers are now keen to get those figures nailed down with mr poots telling bbc radio ulster he anticipates the amount to be in the billions he said he did nt want to make any promise on a figure and i said all you have to say is billions and of course that would be at least two billion he said however a number 10 source described the 2bn figure as just speculation the irish government has also made financial pledges within the agreement to honour commitments to part fund some north / south projects such as the a5 dual carriageway and a redevelopment of the ulster canal system mr johnson said the agreement to restore power sharing meant the devolved government would be able to deliver much needed reforms to public services ministers will need to hit the ground

lords arlene foster re - appointed as first minister as powersharing returns to ni a priority for the new devolved government will be to address an industrial dispute in the health service that has

reforms increase the number of police officers on the beat and resolve an industrial dispute involving teachers the last dup / sinn fein led coalition government collapsed in january 2017 over a row

the nation speaking to itv news she said the labour party 's decision to hold hustings only in cities was the wrong symbol to send to the country we 've just suffered a shattering defeat in many of the non - urban areas across this country we 're going to have a debate about the future of how to win them back in areas where we 're doing well that are miles away from where they live she told itv news correspondent paul brand just to take liverpool as an example or manchester we could easily be in places like bolton we could easily have the london hustings in one of the constituencies that we either barely hung on or that we need to win back in order to rebuild that road to power ms nandy also touched on the debate around the party having its first female leader saying that while it was important the party had"diverse top leadership teams ultimately the contest was about how we build a team around that leader that takes us back into government retired pope benedict xvi has intervened in a catholic church debate over whether to allow married men to become priests the former pope revealed his views in a book co - authored with guinean cardinal robert sarah in a move that could be seen as an attempt to sway the thinking of his successor pope francis it comes amid discussion of the issue of allowing married men to become priests in order to address a shortage in the amazon where the faithful can go months without having a mass. benedicts intervention is extraordinary given he had promised to remain hidden from the world when he retired in 2013 and pledged his obedience to the new pope do nt bite pope negotiates papal kiss after hand slapping controversy pope offers hope against darkness in christmas day message pope warns climate change turning earth into pile of rubble deserts and refuse he has largely held to that pledge though he penned an essay last year on the sexual abuse scandal that blamed the crisis on the sexual revolution of the 1960s in the book titled from the depths of our hearts priesthood celibacy and the crisis of the catholic church he writes that marriage requires man to give himself totally to his family he said since serving the lord likewise requires the total gift of a man it does not seem possible to carry on the two vocations simultaneously thus the ability to renounce marriage so as to place oneself totally at the lords disposition became a criterion for priestly ministry his reaffirmation of priestly celibacy however gets to the heart of a fraught policy issue that francis is expected to weigh in on the implications for such an intervention are grave and are likely to fuel renewed anxiety about the unprecedented situation of two popes one retired and one reigning living side by side in the vatican gardens justin trudeau has said the canadian government will not rest until we get answers into the downing of a ukrainian passenger plane by an iranian missile all 176 people on board the flight from tehran on wednesday were killed including 138 who were headed for canada iran has admitted the plane was mistaken for a hostile target amid soaring tensions with the united states speaking at a memorial in edmonton alberta mr trudeau said the government will not rest until there is justice and accountability iran denied for three days that it was the cause of the crash initially blaming engine failure mr trudeau said it has been gut wrenching to listen to stories from relatives of 57 canadians who died in the downing of a ukrainian jetliner in iran he said he has learned many of the victims came to canada in search of new opportunities for their families but those families are now consumed by grief and outrage iranians defy police for second night to protest over downed plane dominic raab warns of pariah status for iran after arrest of uk ambassador iran admits it unintentionally shot down ukrainian plane mr trudeau called it a canadian tragedy this tragedy should never have occurred he said we will not rest until there are answers we will not rest until there is justice and accountability other memorials were held across the country at the vancouver art gallery national defence minister harjit sajjan also called the crash a national tragedy at the university of toronto many cried throughout the ceremony as speakers listed victims including a one year old child fati mortazavi whose best friend died in the crash said having a community come together helped her cope with the tragedy foreign affairs minister francois philippe champagne said canada 's standing rapid deployment team arrived in iran on saturday to provide consular assistance to the families of the victims and to assist in the investigation meanwhile online videos have emerged purporting to show iranian police and security forces firing live ammunition and tear gas to disperse demonstrators protesting against the islamic republics initial denial that it shot down the plane international rights groups have called on iran to allow people to protest peacefully as allowed by the countrys constitution labour leadership contender rebecca long bailey has said she would abolish the house of lords if she succeeded in becoming prime minister the shadow business secretary said she would be unveiling a radical package of constitutional measures if she won the contest to succeed jeremy corbyn i do want to abolish the house of lords and well be rolling out as my campaign progresses how we intend to really shake up that constitutional package she told sky newss sophy ridge on sunday programme there would need to be checks and balances in place but to have a set of completely unelected people doing that i do nt think is right ms long bailey 's biggest political rival is sir keir starmer who is the current front runner in the race to replace mr corbyn the pair along with lisa nandy and jess phillips have all got the backing of at least 22 mps or meps they are required to get by 2.30pm on monday in order to progress through to the next round shadow foreign secretary emily thornberry currently has 10 nominations and clive lewis four starmer vows to protect labour radicalism as momentum urges long bailey support rosena allin khan on a ministry of fabulosity and dissecting labour 's defeat labour leadership hopefuls make opening pitches to mps on saturday ms long bailey who has long been seen as the favourite of the labour left secured the backing of the grassroots momentum group she indicated that if she succeeded in becoming prime minister she would not stand in the way of a fresh referendum on scottish independence i m fully committed to the union and i do nt think that should be shaken in any way but ultimately the people of scotland need to make the case she said they ve got their own parliament to determine whether they want to push that and that will be for me as a prime minister to review and to look at i would nt want to inhibit the democracy of people because that s one of the most fundamental pillars that were proud of in this country why brexit should shape labour 's leadership election long bailey gives corbyn 10/10 but says she is not his continuity candidate labour leadership race who are the contenders ms long bailey said she would work very hard and very robustly to tackle anti - semitism in the party and she was unhappy at the way the issue had been dealt with i was nt happy with the way our process was being run ill be honest i do nt think we were dealing with complaints quickly enough and i think that s quite clear i ve been quite vocal about that she said i spoke to jeremy about it i spoke to the various members of the team i spoke to various members of the nec national executive committee about that asked if mr corbyn bore personal responsibility she said he does and he s apologised i think any labour politician that leads the labour party should apologise again for what has happened because it has been unacceptable video report by itv news political correspondent romilly weeks labour leadership frontrunner sir keir starmer has vowed to win back traditional voters ahead of the next general election while at the same protecting radical policies put forward by jeremy corbyn sir keir who is way ahead in the race 's first stage with 68 colleagues backing him has already made it through to the second stage by securing the backing from at least 22 or 10 % of labour mps and meps in a bid to win over the current leader 's supporters sir keir told an audience in manchester as he formally launched his campaign that jeremy corbyn was right to position labour as the party of anti - austerity we are not going to trash the last labour government but nor are we going to trash the last four years there have been very many important moves he said jeremy corbyn made our party the party of anti - austerity and he was right to do so but the task of persuading the left of labour to back him was made harder by campaign group momentum which on saturday came out in support of sir keir 's nearest rival rebecca long bailey ms long bailey who is also in the race 's second stage with 26 colleague nominations is backed by left wing momentum as the only viable candidate for leader able to build on the party 's socialist agenda long bailey gives corbyn 10/10 but says she is not his continuity candidate everything you need to know about the labour leadership election the grassroots movement which propelled mr corbyn to the labour leadership is also recommending its members support shadow education secretary angela rayner as deputy arguing the two would work well together to form a united front against the tories momentum will now ask its members whether they agree with the recommendations with ballots consisting of just two questions to be sent out early next week the group 's support for ms long bailey is unsurprising given that she has long been the favoured candidate of the left to take on mr corbyn 's mantle but despite rating mr corbyn 's leadership 10 out of 10 ms long bailey denies being his continuity candidate as she has been described speaking at a labour event in staffordshire she said i 'm not anybody 's continuity candidate i 'm principled and it 's my principles that have led me here not my personal ambitions she and sir keir will be joined in the leadership contest 's second stage where candidates are required to gain backing from grassroots labour parties and trade unions by jess phillips and lisa nandy but it looks like the remaining contenders may struggle to get the required 22 signatures to make it through to the next round arlene foster re - appointed as first minister as powersharing returns to ni starmer labour must regain people 's trust northern ireland 's stormont to resume after deal to restore powersharing emily thornberry has 10 signatures and clive lewis is slumping further with just four when asked both gave current labour leader mr corbyn a poor rating out of 10 with mr lewis scoring him six and ms thornberry giving him zero but sir keir has refused to rank mr corbyn 's leadership saying doing so trivialises him jeremy corbyn led us through really difficult times as a labour party he positioned us in the right place on anti - austerity but we lost the election and now he is stepping down that is the right thing to do he said i am not going to get into ranking jeremy corbyn out of 10 i think it trivialises him he is a friend and a colleague i respect him thank him for what he has done but we are moving on now stormonts first and deputy first ministers have been appointed after powersharing returned to northern ireland dup leader arlene foster resumes the first minister role she lost when the last coalition executive collapsed in 2017 while sinn feins stormont leader michelle oneill has become deputy first minister despite the titles both offices hold equal status in the ministerial executive ms foster said she was deeply humbled the dup leader said there was plenty of blame to go around for the three year powersharing impasse but she insisted it was now time to look to the future significantly given one of the key disputes at the heart of political crisis ms foster made reference to an irish language phrase in a speech that stressed the need to work together going forward when i visited our ladys grammar in newry the pupils gave me a lovely picture as a gift she said it has hung in my office upstairs ever since just above my shoulder in irish it states together we are strong we have many differences michelles narrative of the past 40 years could not be more different to mine i m not sure we will ever agree on much about the past but we can agree there was too much suffering and that we can not allow society to drift backwards and allow division to grow northern ireland is succeeding in many ways its time for stormont to move forward and show that together we are stronger for the benefit of everyone irelands foreign affairs minister recalls how lyra mckee murder sparked talks ms oneill said it was a defining moment for the region after three years without functioning institutions with the five parties forming the new executive it is my hope that we do so united in our determination to deliver a stable power sharing coalition that works on the basis of openness transparency and accountability and in good faith and with no surprises she said i am honoured to follow in the footsteps of my dear friend and comrade martin mc guinness taking up the position of deputy first minister and as joint head of government i too pledge to follow the example of martin by actively promoting reconciliation and building bridges we can all cross to end sectarianism and

england scotland and wales who turned away from it at the election in december boris johnson said that many voters in the north had lent their votes to the conservatives we must set ourselves the task of winning those votes back he said if elected leader i will pursue boris johnson relentlessly in parliament we will connect our opposition in parliament to labour 's mass movement and to the wider

move that confirms the return of devolved government in northern ireland after a three year absence sinn fein president mary lou mcdonald said a draft agreement tabled by the uk and irish governments

floundering amid the governance vacuum that includes a high profile industrial dispute in the health service which on friday saw nurses again walk out on strike ms mcdonald said the first action the incoming executive must be to deliver was to ensure pay parity to health workers under the terms of the deal the new executive will also take action to reduce spiralling hospital waiting lists extend

are serious challenges ahead the impact of brexit austerity and other pressing issues but the biggest and most significant challenge will be ensuring we have genuine power sharing build on equality respect and integrity she added sinn fein was committed to irish reunification efforts and to make sure all people across the north and south divide enjoy the same rights speaking about the irish language aspects of the deal ms mcdonald said nobody should see this as a threat this is n't about one upmanship this is n't about winners or losers this is about a society that makes room for everyone labour leader jeremy corbyn tweeted i congratulate those in northern ireland who have worked to reach agreement to allow a return to power sharing at stormont the good friday agreement and

then you know you re right it ca nt win but the centre ground of british politics changes and shifts so if were talking about democratising the economy if were talking about giving ourselves a sense of ownership and agency in our lives then these are things which are nt necessarily just socialist these are things which we all want if we want to have a world our children can inherit where they can breathe clean air where we have a national healthcare system where you do nt have 4.4 million people on the waiting list these are things where the centre ground of british politics is there that is

recalled on friday in the hope the parties will turn up and sign up to the deal friday is due to see a strike by healthcare workers in the region mr smith said there was a major financial package on

have a new government three years after the last dup / sinn fein led coalition collapsed now is decision time said mr smith we have had three years of talks finally there is good deal on the table

officers assembly and parliamentary representatives considered the paper on thursday on balance we believe there is a basis upon which the assembly and executive can be re - established in a fair and balanced way she added this is not a perfect deal and there are elements within it which we recognise are the product of long negotiations and represent compromise outcomes there will always need to be give and take mr smith said the parties realised they had reached a critical juncture we have got one chance to get this right and i am under no doubt that everyone realises that this chance is now he said mr coveney said political leaders had a choice whether to meet the proposals with generosity or negativity there is no such thing as a perfect deal and that is why parties have to make choices as to how they respond he said this is the opportunity for people to take the alternatives are not good the impasse has focused on proposals for irish language legislation reform of a contentious

legislation to give civil servants extra powers to run the region 's troubled public services expires and the uk government assumes a legal duty to call a fresh assembly election the uk 's exit from the eu moved a step closer after boris johnson 's brexit bill passed in the house of commons on its third reading mps voted overwhelmingly in favour of the european union withdrawal agreement by 330 votes to 231 a majority of 99 the labour benches were virtually empty and the result was met with huge cheers on the tory side after the result was announced to the chamber house of lords warned not to derail johnsons brexit bill the victory for the prime minister followed a large influx of tory mps in last month 's general election it marks a stark contrast to previous attempts when the conservatives failed to command an overall parliamentary majority in the chamber the bill which paves the way for brexit on january 31 will now go to the lords where it could face a more difficult passage as mr johnson does not have a majority in the upper chamber the government faced continued criticism over the issue of allowing unaccompanied child refugees to continue to be reunited with their families in the uk after exit day the previous government had accepted an amendment from labour peer lord dubs seeking continued protections for child refugees after brexit but following his election victory mr johnson re - drafted the european union withdrawal agreement bill and withdrew his commitment a new conservative mp used his maiden speech to defend the governments decision tory david simmonds said while it is clear that issues around the resettlement of vulnerable children are very much in the minds of many members it is absolutely right that these issues are for the immigration bill rather than the withdrawal agreement bill wab speaking of his former role leading the national work across local government on the resettlement of refugees in the uk mr simmonds said what tends to happen is young people are brought to britain to be linked up with a distant cousin and in fact they almost immediately become an accompanied asylum seeking child and therefore in the care system of this country he added that young refugees in the eu are already within countries that have child protection systems that are very similar equivalent and in some cases better to our own earlier in the debate shadow brexit secretary sir keir starmer said labour can still win the moral argument after its bid to enshrine protections for child refugees in the governments brexit agreement failed he urged the government to reconsider its opposition to his partys plans adding that labour may not win many votes in this parliament but we can win the moral argument brexit secretary steve barclay told mps the government remains committed to taking in unaccompanied children after brexit but the wab was not the right place to do this peers have been told to listen to the will of the country and back legislation paving the way for the uk to leave the european union on january 31 boris johnsons european union withdrawal agreement bill is expected to clear the commons on thursday after the tory general election victory gave the prime minister the comfortable majority he desired but the legislation will then head to the upper chamber where there is no government majority and where peers repeatedly dealt blows to theresa mays administration european commission president wants unprecedented trade deal by end of 2020 downing street urged the unelected house to take heed of the december general election result which delivered mr johnsons 80-seat commons majority the country did deliver a very clear message that they want brexit to be resolved the prime ministers official spokesman said with peers expected to begin work on the withdrawal agreement bill wab next week the government wants the legislation to complete its passage through both houses as smoothly as possible the spokesman said the legislation clearing the commons on thursday would be a significant positive step towards the prime ministers target to get brexit done it follows the torment endured by mrs may as she repeatedly tried and failed to get a brexit deal through the commons downing street stressed it was ready to begin the next stage of the brexit process negotiating a trade deal by the end of the year on february 1 but brussels chief brexit negotiator michel barnier warned the uks market access to the eu could be limited unless it agreed to conditions on state subsidies if the uk wants an open link with us for the products zero tariffs zero quotas we need to be careful about zero dumping at the same time mr barnier told a conference in stockholm i hope that this point is and will be correctly understood by everybody we will ask necessarily certain conditions on state aid policy in the uk he also insisted that britains goal to have a full free trade deal by the end of the year was unrealistic we can not expect to agree on every aspect of this new partnership mr barnier said adding we are ready to do our best in the 11 months what next for brexit after mps back the prime ministers deal the first pmqs of 2020 which was dominated by iran and indyref2 was the shortest in duration for three years true to his word new speaker of the house of commons sir lindsay hoyle kept the length of proceedings to a minimum with the session lasting just 33 minutes in taking over from john bercow sir lindsay vowed to bring pmqs back to its traditional length of just half an hour after the duration had raised to an average of 49 minutes in 2019 when mr bercow was elected speaker in 2009 the average duration was just over 30 minutes by 2015 the average was 35 minutes and bercow 's final session on october 30 2019 lasted 71 minutes aside from allowing long sessions mr bercow had also been criticised for breaking several speaker traditions and was accused of being biased over brexit european commission president wants unprecedented trade deal keir starmer takes lead in labour leadership race after resigning mr bercow became the first former speaker in 230 years not to be offered a peerage in wednesday 's prime minister 's questions labour leader jeremy corbyn chose to attack boris johnson over his handling of what he claims was the illegal assassination of iranian general qassem soleimani by the us mr corbyn accused the pm of prioritising his relationship with president donald trump and a trade deal with the us over the security of the uk and middle east where is the missing house of commons speaker wig john bercows 1995 cv tennis coach with a record for sticking it to the lefties but mr johnson said the iranian general had the blood of british troops on his hands and the strict issue of legality is not for the uk to determine and he said he was very surprised mr corbyn himself had not condemned the actions of soleiman who is accused of sponsoring terrorism in pmqs mr johnson again rejected calls for a new referendum on scottish independence saying scots had already made their decision the snp 's westminster leader ian blackford asked who should determine the future of scotland the pm or the people who live in scotland iran strikes us air base in revenge attack after soleimani killing mr johnson told him the people of scotland voted decisively in 2014 to remain in the uk in what he described as a once in a generation choice before pmqs was commons scotland questions in which scottish secretary alister jack confirmed the uk government had received scottish first minister nicola sturgeon 's request for a second independence referendum mr jack told the commons it would be completely wrong for us to hand those powers over

like to have to be really careful about what you eat and buy in the shops we understand what it is like to have one heater in the house it was tough but my mum worked three jobs to put food on the

end of 2020 but ursula von der leyen who was recently elected to replace jean claude juncker at the helm of the commission warned it would be impossible to agree a full comprehensive deal within the 11 month transition period which begins when the uk leaves the eu on january 31 she said both sides would have to prioritise aspects of the deal but added how the european union is ready to work day and night to get as much done within the time frame that we have ms von der leyen and the eu 's chief brexit negotiator michel barnier met boris johnson in downing street on wednesday afternoon to discuss how a deal can be reached in record time following the meeting a downing street spokesman described the discussions as positive and said the pm planned to start negotiating a canada style fta as soon as possible after january 31 the prime minister has been clear that the implementation period will end at the end of this year and we will work with the european union to negotiate an fta free trade agreement added the number 10 spokesman but ms von der leyen conceded that without an extension of the transition period beyond 2020 you can not expect to agree on every single aspect of our new partnership pm to meet new european commission president iran strikes us air base in revenge attack after soleimani killing we are prepared to design a new partnership with zero tariffs zero quotas zero dumping a partnership that goes well beyond trade and is unprecedented in scope she added while in number 10 ms von der leyen and the prime minister laughed about having went to the same school in belgium and reminisced about a teacher they shared the pm said ursula and i were at school together we were at the same school mr johnson joked about introducing a very rough game to the school called british bulldog it 's a very good game he added ms von der leyen said january 31 britain 's exit day would be a tough and emotional day keir starmer takes lead in labour leadership race who s who in the eu the four key players in the next stages of brexit but she added when the sun rises again on february 1 the united kingdom and the european union will still be the best of friends and partners she ensured the audience that ties between the uk and the european union will continue to be unbreakable but she said there would be consequences to brexit our partnership can not and will not be the same as before she said it will not be as close as before because with every choice comes a consequence with every decision comes a trade off without the free movement of people you can not have the free movement of capital goods and services without a level playing field on environment labour and state aid you can not have the highest quality access to the world 's largest single market the more divergence there is the more distant the partnership will be earlier on wednesday brexit secretary stephen barclay who also attended the meeting said we believe it can be done let 's be positive let 's be optimistic let 's get that trade deal in place he explained that today 's downing street meeting will focus on how the two sides can ensure we do have that trade deal in place but said fine details wo n't be discussed labour leadership frontrunner sir keir starmer has hired jeremy corbyn 's former campaigns chief as a key strategic advisor to his bid to run the party the appointment of simon fletcher a left wing labour veteran who also worked for ed milliband and ken livingstone is being viewed as a move to draw in support from those who backed jeremy corbyn when he was elected as leader the coup of bringing a corbynite into his team came at the end of a good day for sir keir who now has enough nominations from colleagues to reach the second stage of the labour leadership contest on wednesday morning the party published the first running tally of nominations from mps and meps revealing shadow brexit secretary starmer has already gathered the required 22 backers with his total at 24 later he was given another boost by unison the country 's largest union which announced that it is backing sir keir starmer for leader unison 's backing means sir keir is now almost certain to get his name onto the ballot paper which will be sent to labour members long bailey gives corbyn 10/10 but says she is not his continuity candidate labour leadership race who are the contenders and with mr fletcher on board sir keir a more centrist candidate will be feeling confident he can unite different factions within the labour party he also hired another former corbyn staff member kat fletcher as director of field and former darlington mp jenny chapman who lost her seat in the recent election is chair of the campaign sir keir said his campaign team draws on the breadth of talent energy and enthusiasm from across the labour movement unison also thew its support behind deputy leadership candidate and shadow education secretary angela rayner sir keir said he was delighted and honoured to have the backing of unison but was careful not to get ahead of himself it 's very early days i 'm obviously pleased with the support that i 've got but there are excellent candidates in this race with me he said unsurprisingly sir keir 's backers include high profile remainers such as david lammy who supported his efforts to push the party towards advocating a second referendum but that policy has been questioned in the wake of the party 's haemorrhaging seats in its brexit backing heartlands in second place is the left 's preferred candidate rebecca long bailey she has been named the continuity candidate and yesterday rated jeremy corbyn 's leadership 10 out of 10 in an interview with me on itv news almost all of her declared supporters are new mps which suggests the battle to get left wing candidates selected in key seats before the election has paid off labour leadership hopefuls make opening pitches to mps peston why brexit should shape labour 's leadership election jess phillips currently has 6 nominations with lisa nandy on 2 and emily thornberry on 1 the sixth candidate clive lewis has yet to receive any nominations but his team say half a dozen mps have already publicly supported him further running tallies will be published each day with mps having until the 13th january to nominate their preferred candidate ultimately it 'll be up to members the unions and registered supporters to decide who the winner is candidates who receive enough nominations from colleagues will then enter phase two of the contest where they have to secure the backing of 5 % of constituency labour branches or at least three affiliate groups two of which must be maid up of trade unions to get onto the final ballot paper and face election by the membership unison 's backing of sir keir provides him with further momentum at the start of the campaign the decision was taken by the union 's labour link committee which is made up entirely of labour members general secretary dave prentis said this is a pivotal time for labour "we believe if elected by the membership keir starmer would be a leader to bring the party together and win back the trust of the thousands of voters who deserted labour last month keir has a clear vision to get labour back to the winning ways of the past he is best placed to take on boris johnson hold his government to account and ensure labour can return to power and once more change working people 's lives for the better announcing unison 's support for ms rayner mr prentis said angie has a long association with unison as a member and a representative and has an intimate understanding of the day to day struggles facing working people and their families across the uk angie 's popularity across the party means she is the right person to handle the challenges of this job angie will make a great deputy leader if elected "contenders vying to be party 's deputy leader also set out their stalls to mps on wednesday boris johnson will meet the new european commission president ursula von der leyen for talks in downing street on wednesday the prime minister is expected to press home his desire to reach a free trade agreement with the eu by the end of december 2020 when the transition period is set to end mr johnson has insisted he will not push back the deadline but critics claim that the timescale is too tight to reach a new deal their meeting the first since she took office will also be attended by brexit secretary stephen barclay and the eus chief brexit negotiator michel barnier despite a trade deal having never been agreed between the eu and another country within such a tight timescale 11 months mr barclay and mr johnson are confident an agreement can be reached we believe it can be done let 's be positive let 's be optimistic let 's get that trade deal in place mr barclay said ahead of meeting the eu representatives labour leadership hopefuls make opening pitches to mps the discussions with the prime minister and the commission president between myself and michel barnier today are in order to get that work moving forward and ensure we do have that trade deal in place he added number 10 said mr johnson will underline that the forthcoming negotiations will be based on an ambitious free trade agreement and not on alignment brussels insisted on monday that trade talks would not be on the agenda at the meeting european commission spokesman eric mamer said the meeting would set the scene for the brexit process but in order to launch trade talks the european council made up of the 27 remaining eu nations would need to approve a mandate and we are not at that stage yet this is not a meeting that will go into the details of the trade negotiation per se he added lack of privy council briefing on soleimani death raises questions over legality why brexit should shape labour 's leadership election downing street hinted earlier in the week that the government could conduct post - brexit trade talks with the us in parallel with those with the eu the prime ministers official spokesman said the uk would be free to hold trade discussions with countries across the world after it has left the bloc at the end of the month it followed reports in the sunday times that mr johnsons ministers are split over how best to negotiate a new trade deal with the eu with some figures including foreign secretary dominic raab and international trade secretary liz truss reportedly pushing for parallel talks with the us to put pressure on the eu however the paper said other ministers think it is unrealistic to use the us talks as a leverage against brussels mps vying to replace jeremy corbyn as labour leader have made their opening pitches to the parliamentary party six candidates rebecca long bailey sir keir starmer emily thornberry lisa nandy jess phillips and clive lewis set out their stalls in parliament on tuesday evening addressing the parliamentary labour party plp shadow business secretary ms long bailey said that in losing the election labour let down the people who rely on us our number one duty as labour mps is to learn the lessons of defeat and make sure we do nt repeat them she told the private meeting how will the election campaign pan out over the coming months long bailey insists she 's not corbyn 's continuity candidate earlier the frontbencher insisted that she was not the continuity candidate to replace mr corbyn but gave him a 10 out of 10 rating describing him as one of the most honest kind principled politicians i ve ever met she told itv news what we ca nt ignore was that jeremy was savaged from day one by the press we have a role as party to develop the image of our leader and to put them forward in the most positive way but we also have a duty to rebut criticism and attacks as a party we needed to have a rebuttal unit a clear structure in place to rebut the attacks against him shadow brexit secretary sir keir told the hustings that the party needs to win back our heartlands he said we need to understand and to address each and every reason we lost at this election but we also need to win back scotland we need to win back seats in wales and if you draw a line from london to bristol and look south we only have a handful seats so we have got a mountain to climb rival lisa nandy the mp for wigan said the leadership debate was possibly the most important in our history now is not the time to steady the ship if we do not change course we will die and we will deserve to she added why brexit should shape labour 's leadership election jess phillips told the hustings she does not want to be the next leader of the opposition but rather the next labour prime minister i want the people here to be in government i have dedicated my life to trying to change the lives of others but i am sick of just shifting the dial i want to smash it the birmingham yardley mp said labour candidate proposes ministry of fabulosity in the race for the deputy post triggered by tom watsons decision to quit shadow sport minister rosena allin khan and labours only mp in scotland ian murray became the latest candidates to launch their bids ms allin khan told itv new 's acting prime minister podcast that she would like to create a ministry of fabulosity if she was elected deputy leader she said its a real ministry it will have to be dominated by fabulous mps and come out with fabulous policies to shape the country some serious ones but some lighter more entertaining ones about he we see ourselves and some of the things we can do as a nation to put a swing in our step asked what kind of policies she said political debate there is room for traditional political debate but sometimes there is room for a dance off sometimes you need to know how your political representatives can represent themselves in real life we all love a boogie the new labour leader and deputy will be announced at a conference on april 4 the prime minister has refused jeremy corbyn 's request for an urgent privy council briefing about the us assassination of top iranian general qassem soleimani see letter obtained by itv news who was iranian general qassem soleimani embarrassing leaked us letter on iraq troop withdrawal deadly stampede at funeral of iranian general killed by us neither has boris johnson given an oral statement on the killing in the house of commons instead that was done by defence secretary ben wallace inevitably johnsons refusal to bring corbyn into his confidence raises concerns not only about the legality of the assassination ordered by trump but whether our security services believe the us president had sound reason to see soleimani as a clear and present threat to us personnel corbyn has no recourse given the size of his majority johnsons no gives no hope of appeal boris johnson says he is desperate to get brexit off the agenda for his own government so that it can start applying blue cement to the bricks he turned blue in labour 's red wall or throw money and popular policies at the midlands and northern seats he recently pinched from labour in fact he tried to persuade me in an interview during the election that only saddos like me will be remotely interested in the details of the trade and security deal with the eu he courageously believes can be negotiated in a record breaking 11 months for better or ill he may be right i am flabbergasted that many of the business leaders to whom i speak who hated brexit have capitulated and are now johnson groupies but for the opposition brexit should and must rear its head at least till a new leader is announced on 4 april because the labour party 's mishandling of how and whether the uk leaves the eu may represent the greatest fluffed opportunity of any opposition in history the open goal stretched from humber to the mersey and labour still missed rebecca long bailey gives jeremy corbyn 10/10 on leadership but says she is not his continuity candidate labour leadership race who are the contenders here are the relevant facts labour fought the 2017 general election on a platform of delivering the result of the 2016 referendum viz withdrawal from the eu it then saw a tory party tearing itself apart over whether that brexit should be softish which was the position of the then prime minister theresa may and not a million miles from labour 's own official position or whether brexit should be hard and clean the cause of the brexit ultras of the european research group erg if labour had voted for the kind of customs union based brexit that may was shaping and forced it into law the conservative party would almost certainly have torn itself apart this is not ex - post speculation given that johnson now benefits from what the former tory chancellor philip hammond calls a parliamentary dictatorship it is easy to forget that less than a year ago the brexit induced destruction of the conservative party was very much on the cards tory mps in the erg were not bluffing when they said proper brexit mattered much more than the survival of their party if labour had called may 's bluff and underwritten her brexit which would probably have kept the uk in the customs union forever thanks to that backstop that was detested by the erg labour would have eviscerated the tory party while appearing principled and statesmanlike in other words labour had the holy grail of politics in its grasp the ability to trounce opponents while doing what many would have seen as the right thing instead of which labour went through a charade of negotiating a brexit compromise with may while never being remotely serious about doing a deal which is what those close to jeremy corbyn told me very explicitly at the time labour played brexit as a game what is the party 's harvest johnson has united his party by purging it of those tory mps who wanted a soft brexit and it is now labour tearing itself apart over its future direction and by promising to get brexit done sorry johnson won a near landslide and humiliated labour which today has fewer seats in the commons than at any time for 85 years to add insult to labour 's humiliation johnson will deliver a brexit that will be much closer to the hard break with the eu favoured by the erg than that of may or labour 's 2017 election manifesto or to put it another way labour 's strategic failure on brexit is arguably as catastrophic as it could possibly have been all of which surely means that the candidates to be labour leader must say what in retrospect labour should and could have done differently because there is little hope of redemption for the party if it can not do the work on how it fluffed the greatest opportunity in its history namely the chance to devastate its great historic enemy this question is most serious for those candidates starmer long bailey thornberry who were in corbyn 's shadow cabinet and therefore have their hands deepest in the blood of an egregious opportunity cost but lewis nandy and phillips must also look back to understand the lesson to be clear it may be that the biggest mistake made by corbyn 's labour was to campaign in that 2017 election on a platform of delivering brexit rather than at that early stage opting wholeheartedly for a referendum and remaining in the eu but once the manifesto was published labour 's obligation in the british system was to do what the manifesto promised maybe there is some kind of natural justice that it has been so punished for reneging on the manifesto but in the absence of owning up to the putative political crime rehabilitation looks a distant prospect video report by itv news royal editor chris ship the duke and duchess of sussex have spoken of the unbelievable welcome they received while in canada and joked how their son archie was mesmerised by the scenery meghan and harry 's first official engagement of the new decade was to publicly thank the commonwealth country for hosting them during an extended private break over the festive period the couple were described by a royal aide as feeling energised and excited to be back in the uk after spending the majority of a six week break in the province of british columbia where they were spotted hiking on vancouver island the couple visited canada 's high commission in central london and sat down for tea with janice charette canada 's high commissioner to the uk and her deputy sarah fountain smith and were even served the popular chocolate treat of nanaimo bars from british columbia in a possible indication of the months ahead with the sussexes ' royal foundation expected to be launched this year harry said later about their chat with ms charette there 's a hell of a lot of work to be done and things to be talked through but a very useful conversation the high commissioner said during the conversation the couple talked about their holiday and some of the things on their minds in terms of priorities for the next year and areas where they see maybe a shared priority with canada we talked about a few of those things whether challenges relating to gender equality and gender empowerment issues of homelessness whether that 's due to mental health stigma issues of veterans homelessness issues relating to the invictus games and the challenges of conservation and climate change they later met staff gathered on the commission 's grand staircase and the duke in a reference to their successful break asked anyone here from british colombia when a few hands went up he said what a beautiful place you live in new photo of royal baby archie cuddling the duke of sussex released baby archie brought joy during a difficult year for harry and meghan harry went on to say thank you so much and made the group laugh when he added not that you had anything much to do with it but the warmth and hospitality we were shown while there was unbelievable and that 's exactly why we chose to go out there meghan a former actress lived and worked in toronto during her time starring in the popular us drama suits and the couple were famously pictured together when meghan joined her then boyfriend harry at the 2017 invictus games in the city the duchess was beside her husband and told the high commission staff i want to say happy new year and thank you and as my husband said my goodness it was just such an incredible time we were able to have there and with our son too and just to be able to take in the warmth that we experienced from the people but also just to walk around and just see the beauty of canada to see archie go ahhh when you walk by and just see how stunning it is so it meant a lot to us the couple who were said to be jet lagged after their recent transatlantic flight arrived at canada house from a private visit to the hubb community kitchen run by a group of women whose recipes were featured in a cookbook backed by meghan queen 's admission of a bumpy 2019 for the royal family in christmas message harry meghan and archie pictured on christmas card the duchess was the force behind the book suggesting the idea to a group of women who came together to cook at a muslim cultural centre in north kensington in the aftermath of the grenfell blaze meghan travelled to see the women in north kensington to hear the latest updates about their project and was joined by harry after more than six weeks away from the public events the duchess looked stylish and reportedly wore a brown skirt and matching roll neck top by massimo dutti and a reiss camel coat during their visit they were given a guided tour of canada gallery and viewed a special exhibition by indigenous canadian artist skawennati the award winning new media artist based in montreal was not present but her work creating avatars based on indigenous people in cyber space was represented by pictures and tiny figures a small group of staff were also introduced to the royals after their tour of the gallery which is open to the public the couple went on their extended break after they experienced an eventful few months during 2019 harry and meghan faced reports of a rift first between meghan and kate and then between harry and his brother william in a television documentary broadcast last october harry when asked about the situation said he loved his brother dearly but they were on different paths at the moment and have good days and bad days in their relationship meghan admitted feeling vulnerable and spoke of the difficulty in coping with intense tabloid interest saying it 's not enough to just survive something that 's not the point of life you have got to thrive the couple 's high profile visit to africa last autumn was overshadowed on the penultimate day when the duke condemned the british tabloid press for bullying his wife as meghan launched a lawsuit against associated newspapers video report by itv news political correspondent paul brand words by westminster producer lewis denison labour leadership hopeful rebecca long bailey has told itv news she is not the jeremy corbyn continuity candidate as she has been critically described but said she gives his leadership ten out of ten ms long bailey who announced her leadership bid on monday evening following weeks of speculation is being viewed by many as the candidate who will carry the torch of corbynism into the next election mr corbyn announced he would stand down as labour leader following the party 's disastrous defeat in last month 's general election i 'm not anybodys continuity candidate she told itv news political correspondent paul brand but she did little to dispel those allegations instead she praised mr corbyn saying she is proud of the fact that over the last four years i 've been immersed in developing many of the policies that made it into the manifesto labour leadership race who are the contenders rebecca long bailey announces bid to become next labour leader with socialist agenda she went further in her lauding of mr corbyn saying she would give his leadership of labour a 10 out of 10 and said he is one of the most honest kind principled politicians she has ever met she claimed she and the current leader are very different people but when pressed for a direct answer as to why her response suggested there is little difference in ideology we are very different in our approach to the way we deal with policy the way that we speak certainly my tone is very different to jeremy 's she said she said she agreed with mr corbyn 's policies such as the green new deal and economic reform but said she was sad the ideas were not sold properly during the election campaign mr corbyn responded to the praise heaped upon him describing long bailey as a wonderful colleague a brilliant member of the shadow cabinet but he stopped short of backing her for leader and declined to reveal who he would be voting for asked if he would give ms long bailey 10 out of 10 mr corbyn responded well she 's given me 10 out of 10 but i never mark my own homework when asked how she has fun ms long bailey said her favourite hobby is having a chinese takeaway and watching a box set on a friday night with my husband i have nt done anything crazy i do n't go to the bars in westminster regularly she said adding how the most important thing in her life is her son my life centres around my little boy making sure the time i spend time with my family is fun for him taking him to trampoline parks and things like that she said by itv news westminster producer lewis denison where does the labour party go from here and who will take it there jeremy corbyn is on his way out but that does not necessarily spell the end for corbynism an array of six contenders from across the party have so far thrown their hats into the ring in the race to replace him all offering a different direction for the party to the left there 's rebecca long bailey the continuity candidate as she 's been called who would likely carry the torch of corbynism into the next election then there 's candidates like birmingham mp jess phillips who many say represents the political centre ground and would more likely morph the party back into a state similar to its previous incarnation new labour among the other candidates is the race 's odds on favourite a couple of wildcards and a despatch box veteran but who will win here 's a rundown of all the current contenders and what they represent sir keir starmer since long before jeremy corbyn resigned as labour leader sir keir starmer had been mooted as his potential successor which is possibly why he is the favourite the 57-year old has only been an mp since 2015 but his relative inexperience in parliament has not stopped him rising through the ranks but the very senior role he 's ended up with in the labour party shadow brexit secretary and the stance he 's taken while in the job could be to his detriment as well as his benefit peston why keir starmer is the labour leadership candidate to beat while in the role he cemented his status as a straight talking statesman but he also ardently campaigned for the party to back a second eu referendum a policy which many blame for the poor election performance he is also a london mp and many say what the party needs is a leader from elsewhere in order to bring back disenfranchised voters from traditional labour heartlands such as the north of england before announcing his bid for the leadership it was thought starmer could ditch much of corbyn 's policies and take the party back to the centre but when revealing his candidacy he urged the party not to lurch to the right and said the case for a bold and radical labour government is as important as ever the human rights lawyer who was made queen 's counsel in 2002 served as head of the cps and accepted a knighthood in 2014 rebecca long bailey rebecca long bailey is another of the race 's favourites but that is more because of her association with corbyn and the make up of the left leaning membership who elected him twice many of the party 's more than half a million members those who will eventually elect the leader joined the party because of corbyn and it is believed many of them want labour to move on in his image but its not just the membership who must back her she needs at least 22 labour mps and or meps to support her and it is not certain they will the question for her colleagues will be did labour lose the election because of corbyn or just because of his policies if the policies are to blame then 40-year old long bailey could be the change of face the party needs will labour 's next leader be female long bailey gives corbyn 10/10 but says she is not his continuity candidate everything you need to know about the labour leadership election announcing her bid for the leadership the shadow business secretary said she could be trusted with the partys socialist agenda and claimed the election was not lost because of its socialist programme but it 's for that reason many including former deputy leader tom watson are concerned about her the one that i worry about but i do n't know what she stands for i mean when i look at rebecca long bailey she 's really the continuity candidate watson told sky news on monday morning she sort of stands for corbynism in its purest sense and that 's perfectly legitimate but we have lost two elections with that play lisa nandy wigan mp and former shadow cabinet minister lisa nandy has vowed to do things differently compared to the current leader if she is to succeed him ms nandy said it was important for the next labour leader to connect to parts of the country outside london in order to regain power she launched the centre for towns think tank something which could give her an advantage in understanding why voters in former industrial labour heartlands switched to the tories announcing her bid for the leadership in her local newspaper she said we need a different sort of leadership that helps to root us back in every community across the uk turns us back into a real movement and real force driven from the ground up so that we can win peoples trust back labour leadership hopefuls criticise manifestos scale in bid to succeed corbyn we ve been wiped out in scotland virtually we ve seen the red wall crumble in the north and midlands and parts of north wales ms nandy said she would like to see power moved from outside london and into local towns and regions whose decisions will impact on that community she said that too many people no longer feel they have a voice in our national story and did not believe that politicians were interested in what they had to say before being elected in 2010 ms nandy worked for the youth homelessness charity centrepoint and the children 's society emily thornberry dropped out the race shadow foreign secretary emily thornberry is the race 's most experienced mp having been the representative for islington south and finsbury since 2005 she is also the candidate with the most experience facing prime minister boris johnson across the despatch box mr johnson was her counterpart when he served in theresa may 's cabinet as foreign secretary and the pair had several heated rows ms thornberry one of corbyn 's closest allies in an article for the guardian touted her credentials in facing the pm as a reason she should be leader but she has the same problem as sir keir in that she fervently backed remaining in the eu and is a london mp defending herself she said the next leader should be elected for their political nous and strategic vision rather than their position on brexit or where they live in our country thornberry joined labour when she was 17 and was motivated by her experiences being raised by her mother a single parent living on a council estate jess phillips dropped out the race for a backbench mp who has never held a senior role within the labour jess phillips ' public profile is huge she 's possibly most known for her passionate forthright and often funny house of commons speeches which have been known to go viral on social media it 's possibly for that reason she has almost 352,000 followers on twitter making her the most popular on social media out of the contenders but there is a concern she may not be popular among the labour membership due to her outspoken criticism of corbyn for that reason she will be hoping she can persuade her social media followers to join the party and back her launching her campaign ms phillips said it was important for labour to learn from the mistakes of the 2019 election that saw the party lose traditional heartlands to the conservative party that helped give boris johnson a big majority the birmingham yardley mp said labour needed to elect a leader who gets it adding the party needed to be brave and bold in where they stood against a prime minister who blusters and lies labour needs a leader who will speak truth to both the party and the country she said in a statement she continued i was nt sure if i was going to stand in this contest but listening to the debate in the days after the election i thought we ve got to elect someone who gets it someone who understands how serious this defeat was were a party named after the working class who has lost huge parts of its working class base unless we address that we are in big trouble clive lewis dropped out the race if clive lewis is to be elected leader of the labour party it will certainly be viewed as a surprise result despite being the shadow treasury minister the 48-year old is relatively inexperienced in parliament having only been an mp for four years he is a passionate remainer on the left of the party as confirmed by his association with the love socialism hate brexit campaign since being elected as the mp for norwich south in 2015 lewis had been tightly linked to the corbyn movement but he 's slowly began to distance himself from it writing in the guardian to announce his leadership bid the former bbc journalist and army reservist criticised mr corbyn 's prevarication and lack of leadership mr lewis said he wanted to have the opportunity to win back the trust of the electorate in labours traditional heartlands where large swathes of voters deserted the party in favour of boris johnsons conservatives at the election the truth is that while making a clear break with the new labour era in terms of policy and personnel the party was never able to communicate this to voters in our heartlands he said who 's running to be deputy leader several have confirmed they are running to be deputy and a handful are said to be considering their chances the biggest name on the list is angela rayner the shadow education secretary who before announcing her bid for deputy was thought to be a favourite for leader another big name of confirmed contenders is shadow justice secretary richard burgon who stood in for mr corbyn during a televised election debate the shadow women and equalities secretary dawn butler is another big name who officially entered the race on the day it began tuesday january 7 rosena allin khan a fresh faced mp who has only been in parliament since a 2016 tooting by election is another hoping to succeed tom watson scotland 's only labour mp is also running ian murray who 's position as a corbyn skeptic with a large majority will likely stand him in good stead boris johnson is to chair a meeting of the national security council as britain continued to urge all sides in the gulf crisis to draw back from all out conflict foreign secretary dominic raab spoke on monday to his iranian counterpart mohammed javad zarif to stress the need for a diplomatic resolution to avoid a renewed conflict in the region tehran has vowed severe revenge for the killing of its top military commander qassem soleimani in a us drone strike last week president donald trump in turn has warned the us was ready to strike back in a disproportionate manner if the iranians hit us targets the ministry of defence refused to comment on reports it is stepping up contingency plans to evacuate military and civilian personnel from neighbouring iraq amid fears they could be targets for iranian reprisals us denies iraq troop withdrawal despite letter suggesting it will uk distances itself from trump 's threat to iranian cultural sites the times reported that a team of around 20 senior military planners and liaison officers had been dispatched to the embassy in baghdad over the weekend defence secretary ben wallace is due to update mps returning to westminster following their christmas break on the latest situation in the region the prime minister has faced criticism he was slow to respond to the crisis only returning to the uk at the weekend following his new year break on the private caribbean island of mustique the former national security adviser lord ricketts said that ministers should have been quicker to react to the escalation i think that the british government were caught short by this he told bbc2s newsnight people were still on holiday and there was nt sufficient early recognition at the top level that this is a serious crisis and really dangerous for western interests in the middle east yes i m glad to see that the wheels are now in motion and things are happening but we are four days downwind of this sudden and dramatic escalation lord ricketts said he would have expected the national security council to have met on friday when the killing of gen soleimani took place to co - ordinate measures to ensure british nationals were protected that may have been going on behind the scenes but there was nt as far as i could see a collective discussion among senior ministers mr johnson has sought to tread a delicate diplomatic path joining with french and german allies in calling for a de - escalation in the region at the same time he is anxious to maintain good relations with the trump administration ahead of talks with the us on a post - brexit trade deal mr raab is due to fly to washington later this week to meet secretary of state mike pompeo after he criticised the lack of support by the europeans including the uk for the us action the foreign secretary echoed mr johnson in saying the uk would not lament the passing of gen soleimani who he described as a regional threat however he also warned that a threat by mr trump to target iranian cultural sites would be a breach of international law we have been very clear that cultural sites are protected under international law and we would expect that to be respected he said meanwhile us defence secretary mark esper was forced to deny the us was about to withdraw its troops from iraq where the strike on gen soleimani took place a leaked letter from a us marine corps commander said that in due deference to the sovereignty of the republic of iraq the coalition would be re - positioning forces over the coming days and weeks to prepare for onward movement it added we respect your sovereign decision to order our departure it followed a vote in the iraqi parliament on sunday backed by prime minister adel abdul mahdi calling for the withdrawal of all foreign troops including british forces the pentagon said the letter addressed to the iraqi defence ministry had been a poorly worded draft which should never have been released mr esper told reporters in washington there s been no decision whatsoever to leave iraq there s no decision to leave nor did we issue any plans to leave or prepare to leave mr johnson emphasised the need to maintain a coalition presence in iraq against islamic state when he spoke by telephone to mr abdul mahdi on monday around 400 uk troops are stationed in iraq in the fight against is while the us has 5,200 prompting fears of a withdrawal that could cripple the battle against the terror group rebecca long bailey has announced she will run to be the next labour leader arguing she can be trusted with the partys socialist agenda in an article for tribune magazine the shadow business secretary described the recent election result which saw labour suffer its worst as devastating but called on the party to regroup against the climate crisis and the march of the far right we need a proud socialist to lead the labour party driven by their principles and an unwavering determination to see democratic socialism in our lifetime she said it is true that one reason we lost the election was that labours campaign lacked a coherent narrative but this was a failure of campaign strategy not of our socialist programme labours green new deal is the most ambitious agenda for tackling climate change of any major political party and throughout the election it was consistently and tragically undersold everything you need to know about the labour leadership election new labour leader to be announced on april 4 with contest officially starting tomorrow labour leadership hopefuls criticise manifestos scale in bid to succeed jeremy corbyn she outlined her vision to rebuild the party saying we must go to war with the political establishment with a pledge for a constitutional revolution this she argues should involve sweeping away the house of lords taking big money out of politics and shifting power away from westminster she concludes we have a mountain to climb comrades and the crises we face are stark but we have our socialist vision a path to victory and most importantly we have each other more than ever nye bevans words ring true there is only one hope for humanity and that is democratic socialism our strength determination and resilience will prevail together we can do this ian lavery who was tipped to join the leadership contest announced later on monday he will not be standing in a statement shared on social media he said he will instead throw his support behind ms long bailey and called on the party to never take working class communities for granted again who else is in the running sir keir starmer is favourite in the race to replace mr corbyn also in the running are shadow foreign secretary emily thornberry jess phillips lisa nandy and clive lewis earlier on monday shadow education secretary angela rayner when revealing she would run for deputy said she would back her friend and flatmate ms long bailey in the contest a 15-year old girl said she is willing to apologise to opera singer katherine jenkins after she mugged her on a london street before a carol concert the teenager admitted to the robbery of an iphone worth around 500 from the welsh star who had intervened in a struggle with another woman whose bag was being targeted on the kings road in chelsea last month the girl who highbury corner youth court heard is on course for top grades in her gcses also pleaded guilty to assault by beating of an emergency worker after she admitted to assaulting a police constable jenkins was in london to sing at the henry van straubenzee charity carol concert at st lukes church on the day of the incident december 4 the girl who can not be named because of her age said she would be willing to apologise to her victim either face to face or in a letter prosecutor robert simpson told the court that jenkins had a cup in one hand and her phone in the other when she spotted a struggle with a lady in which attackers were trying to take her handbag she intervened at that point he said adding that the defendant thought that she was being filmed and took the phone from jenkins the singer was assisted by members of the public and police arrived mr simpson said the screen on the phone had been broken and there was a clumsy attempt to remove the sim card district judge susan williams imposed a referral order of six months and ordered the girls mother to pay 20 in compensation the judge asked the teenager what she could do to help the victim feel better and she said probably apologise adding i know that s not going to make up for what i did sabrina fitzgerald the girls counsel said the teenager took the phone because she thought she was being filmed she said the girl is on course for the equivalent of a grades in her gcses and said there were issues around peer pressure and poor decision making skills jenkins was not in court for the hearing the next leader of the labour party will be announced on april 4 the party 's national executive committee nec has agreed with the race set to officially get underway tomorrow january 7 the meeting agreed a timetable for the leadership election and discussed whether to change any of the rules to a contest that saw outgoing leader jeremy corbyn elected twice how does a labour leadership election work mps who want to succeed mr corbyn as labour leader will have one week from january 7 to announce whether they will run and to secure nominations from mps and meps of which they need 10 % to get on the ballot if candidates get the required 22 signatures by january 13 they will then need to gain backing from constituency labour parties clp and unions where they will need 5 % from either once prospective leaders have been nominated by their colleagues a new wave of labour party registered supporters will be allowed to join the election process from january 14 - 16 itv news political correspondent paul brand explains the contest anyone who wants to back a candidate but is not already a full member of the labour party will be allowed to pay a fee of 25 to register themselves as supporters and they will be given 48 hours to register to vote in the contest from january 15 until february 14 clps and unions will be able to nominate who they want to be the next leader on january 20 there will be a freeze on new members ' voting rights meaning anyone opting for full membership after this date wo n't be able to vote in the election this marks a change from the last election in 2016 when a retrospective cut off date was set the party said the alteration was intended to ensure the election was as open and democratic as possible the postal ballot of members will then run from february 21 to april 2 with the result being announced two days later on saturday april 4 we are by far the largest political party in the uk with well over half a million members a spokeswoman said we want as many of our members and supporters to take part so it has been designed to be open fair and democratic labour leadership hopefuls criticise manifestos scale in bid to succeed corbyn peston why keir starmer is the labour leadership candidate to beat labour leadership hopeful lisa nandy vows to do things differently the same rules and timetable will apply to the contest to succeed tom watson as deputy leader itv news political correspondent paul brand who has spoken to nec members inside the meeting revealed current leader corbyn wanted the registered voters ' fee lowering to 12 paul says it suggests mr corbyn believes there is still untapped enthusiasm for his style of politics and wants those who back his policies to be able to vote more cheaply in theory paul says those voters would back the left 's preferred candidate probably rebecca long bailey an nec member also told paul the group agreed extra checks to make sure people do n't register their dogs this time while paul says most candidates seem fairly content with the timetable there is a theory that it favours candidates backed by left wing group momentum there was reportedly a row at the nec over membership data which is being withheld from candidates until they receive the required amount of nominations it means any candidate backed by momentum will have access to their data before the others several labour mps have already announced their intention to run the contest but more race entries are expected one mp almost certain to announce her bid to lead the party is shadow business secretary and ally of mr corbyn rebecca long bailey earlier on monday shadow education secretary angela rayner when revealing she would run for deputy said she would back her friend and flatmate ms long bailey in the contest if she runs if ms long bailey does join the leadership contest she will face competition from birmingham backbencher jess phillips shadow brexit secretary sir keir starmer wigan mp lisa nandy shadow treasury minister clive lewis and shadow foreign secretary emily thornberry other labour mps have said they are considering a bid for the leadership including party chairman ian lavery mr lavery on his way to the nec meeting told itv news political correspondent paul brand he is going to wait and see what happens before he decides whether to join the race well take everything as it goes he added at long last they are developing baghdads ferdous square the place where as the world watched saddam husseins statue was toppled almost 17 years ago when its finished it will be a public park with lush flowerbeds fountains and streams this renewal has taken so long to come about because for the most part iraq has been in a state of turmoil ever since april 2003 iraqis have had more pressing matters of life and death to consider iran supreme leader joins ' millions to mourn top general killed in us airstrike donald trump threatens iranian cultural sites despite war crime concerns boris johnson wo n't lament iranian general 's death as iraq parliament calls for expulsion of us troops the last two years have seen a relative calm descend upon baghdad the defeat of islamic state heralded peace and prosperity but now all that is threatened by the fall out from the assassination of qassem soleimani last week the iraqis we spoke today do not want their country plunged back into war they do nt want it to become a battlefield on which the americans and iranians slug it out nor do they want to have to choose sides they are on the side of iraq last night the iraqi parliament passed a non - binding resolution calling for the government to expel the americans from this country but the vote was far from unanimous and whether the government will follow suit or has the authority to do so given its caretaker status is anyones guess president trump inserted himself into that debate by warning of severe sanctions if his forces are ejected i think his point is that if the americans are kicked out iraq will become a virtual iranian province and be treated as such the removal of us forces might also herald the start of a new civil war and the resurgence of the islamic state for iraq the stakes could hardly be higher work on a tranquil new ferdous square may have started but its completion is far from certain labour 's angela rayner has announced her bid to be the party 's deputy adding how she would back rebecca long bailey for leader if she runs ms rayner who spoke about her working class roots and lack of university education told supporters in her home town of stockport she would support her friend and flatmate ms long bailey who is expected to run she said the deputy leadership election is a chance to debate what went wrong and that a core role of the next deputy leader will be to put it right it is why i want the leadership of our party to be a team effort she said i will be quite straightforward i will be voting for my friend rebecca long bailey if she stands for the leadership ms rayner setting out the high stakes for the party she said labour faced the fight of our lives over the next five years after the heavy defeat in the general election saw parts of its former heartlands turn to the conservatives she added our collective leadership must go far wider than simply who is elected to these positions it is why i want us to have an honest but friendly conversation with each other and at the end of it a united party that starts winning elections for us all the announcement came as labour 's national executive committee nec met to debate the rules for the forthcoming leadership election how does a labour leadership election work keir starmer labour should have taken a stronger brexit position issues set to be discussed include the cut off date for the eligibility of new members to vote in the contest and the timetable for the election ms rayner who joins fellow shadow cabinet member richard burgon in the race to be deputy is likely now a favourite to succeed tom watson who resigned from the role ahead of the general election but mr watson who has not yet decided who to back said he 's concerned about the person ms rayner wants to lead the labour party the one that i worry about but i do n't know what she stands for i mean when i look at rebecca long bailey she 's really the continuity candidate he told sky news on monday morning she sort of stands for corbynism in its purest sense and that 's perfectly legitimate but we have lost two elections with that play but she has n't said anything yet as far as i know she has not formally announced and it might be that she chimes a different note in her opening bid and that she wants to take the party in a different direction and she 's very candid about what went wrong if ms long bailey does join the leadership contest she will face competition from birmingham backbencher jess phillips shadow brexit secretary sir keir starmer wigan mp lisa nandy shadow treasury minister clive lewis and shadow foreign secretary emily thornberry labour leadership hopefuls criticise manifestos scale in bid to succeed corbyn peston why keir starmer is the labour leadership candidate to beat other labour mps have said they are considering a bid for the leadership including party chairman ian lavery mr lavery on his way to the nec meeting told itv news political correspondent paul brand he is going to wait and see what happens before he decides whether to join the race well take everything as it goes he added sir keir the favourite to succeed jeremy corbyn said the next labour leader needs to unite the labour party provide really effective opposition to boris johnson and needs to be pulling together a strategy so that we can win in 2024 but he does not want a lurch away from mr corbyn 's policies speaking on skys ridge on sunday he said what jeremy corbyn brought to the labour party in 2015 was the start of saying we should be anti - austerity and pro public services that is right we do nt want to throw that away labour leadership hopeful lisa nandy vows to do things differently i m not pretending we need to keep everything as it is i m not pretending there was anything good about that general election result it was devastating but we should nt retreat from the radical fundamental change is needed in this country and we must deliver it he said ms rayner highlighted seats that had gone from heartlands to battlegrounds and where people have felt labour had lost touch with them setting out what she believed was needed ms rayner who represents ashton under lyne said i will be voting for my friend rebecca long bailey if she stands for the leadership but our collective leadership must go far wider than simply who is elected to these positions it is why i want us to have an honest but friendly conversation with each other video report by itv news political correspondent carl dinnen labour leadership favourite and shadow brexit secretary sir keir starmer has said his party should have taken a stronger position one way or the other on brexit sir keir said that people wanted clarity on the issue which the labour party did not provide and that not enough was done by the party to knock down the tories get brexit done message he added that if he were to become labours new leader he would deliver the fundamental change needed to deal with inequality across the country he said the public lost faith and trust in the labour party as a force for good and a force for change and it 's rebuilding that trust i think that is is vitally important sir keir hopes that his leadership chances will not be hampered because he backed another referendum which some critics have accused of playing a role in labours disastrous election asked why voters can trust him to listen to them after his opposition to brexit he said we listened to the country in the last three years there were many many views on brexit i went to lots of places that voted either remain or leave and of course in most places there was a mixture labour leadership hopefuls criticise manifestos scale in bid to succeed jeremy corbyn how does a labour leadership election work during a campaign visit to brexit backing stevenage he added we are leaving the eu in two to three weeks time and that divide between leave and remain goes when we leave the eu the next labour leader needs to unite the labour party provide really effective opposition to boris johnson and needs to be pulling together a strategy so that we can win in 2024 that s what the next labour needs to do and that is what i m determined to do on behalf of the labour party not on my own but as part of a team we need people alongside me doing this sir keir said he was visiting the hertfordshire town that voted 59 % for leave and has a conservative mp was because it is exactly the type of place where labour needs to win seats meanwhile he blamed the labour defeat on four main reasons which cumulatively caused the party to lose the publics trust speaking on skys ridge on sunday he said the issues there were many of them but they were the leadership rightly or wrongly fairly or unfairly was coming up everywhere the brexit position and whether we were persuading people more importantly whether we were knocking down the tories claim that they would get brexit done anti - semitism came up as a question of values and competence and there was a general feeling that the manifesto was overloaded they were the four main reasons sir keir also outlined what a future labour government led by him would look like calling for more long term investment for businesses and the government and private sector to set green targets and requirements together he added i would like to see private schools as an irrelevant because the state sector was so good and we ve underfunded the state sector but labour should nt throw away all of the ideas followed by jeremy corbyn he said what jeremy corbyn brought to the labour party in 2015 was the start of saying we should be anti - austerity and pro public services that is right we do nt want to throw that away i m not pretending we need to keep everything as it is i m not pretending there was anything good about that general election result it was devastating but we should nt retreat from the radical fundamental change is needed in this country and we must deliver it he said discussing the problems with labours brexit position sir keir added i think clarity about what your position is and not being able to say well would you be leave or remain after a general election was a problem and i made that argument but i accepted the decision i think people wanted clarity and they wanted leadership people had bought the idea that if you vote tory you ll get brexit done and we did nt knock it down hard enough he also said the argument for a second referendum blew away with the election result and that the conversation must move on to the framework for future trade relations were going to leave the eu in the next few weeks labour leadership hopefuls have criticised the scale of jeremy corbyns radical proposals as they set out their stalls to succeed him and recover from the disastrous election defeat prominent backbencher jess phillips would not commit to re - nationalising all key utilities a core labour pledge of the corbyn years and said the free broadband proposal was unbelievable shadow brexit secretary sir keir starmer who became the fifth candidate to enter the race this weekend said labour had lost the trust of voters who felt the manifesto was overloaded sir keir starmer enters labour leadership race jess phillips and lisa nandy launch bids to become next labour leader all of the confirmed candidates apart from shadow minister clive lewis appeared on sundays political shows to make their pitches and bolster their credentials over the crisis in the middle east ms phillips told the andrew marr show she would wait and see how brexit turns out but hinted a return to the eu would be possible under her leadership on the case for re - nationalising rail she said the test has been met that the current system serves literally no one and said profit making in the prisons and probation service had to be stopped but when pressed on post water and energy the birmingham yardley mp told the bbc show that we have to make choices of course we have to in the future look to how those services can better serve the public and nationalisation is one of those ways she said while there are still homeless people literally sleeping outside my office both in london and in birmingham we have to make the choices that people can trust that we will deliver ms philips questioned how the free broadband pledge would have been delivered when other public services were crumbling and people can not get vital social care for their parents while that is the case offering people free broadband was just not believable she said sir keir the current favourite in the race said labour lost the publics trust over a lack of clarity on brexit anti - semitism and a feeling that the manifesto was overloaded but he told marr that we should nt retreat from the radical as he outlined his vision for the future he called for more long term investment for businesses and the government and private sector to set green targets and requirements together i would like to see private schools as an irrelevant because the state sector was so good and we ve underfunded the state sector he added before a visit to brexit backing stevenage emily thornberry enters labour leadership race shadow foreign secretary emily thornberry said the dreadful electoral result was partly because the manifesto just was nt convincing because their was too much in it in the end we can say until we are blue in the face that there is another way- and there is but we wo nt get the opportunity to serve if people do nt believe us she told skys sophy ridge on sunday wigan mp lisa nandy also said the main factor in labours failure was trust and blamed mr corbyn for failing to acknowledge the power of the prime ministers brexit message trust trust was the issue not the radicalism not the deeper fundamental change we were promising but trust she told ridge what we had nt understood is that take back control resonated like no other slogan in my lifetime why did it resonate because people lack the means to affect change in their own lives labour leadership hopeful lisa nandy vows to do things differently rebecca long bailey weighs up bid for labour leadership clive lewis announces he plans to stand in the labour leadership contest shadow business secretary rebecca long bailey who is the current leaderships favoured candidate is widely expected

from across the country about how labour can rebuild and win britain desperately needs a labour government we need a labour government that will offer people hope of a better future however that is

his remain stance has been partly blamed by some corbyn allies for the disastrous election performance appealing to mr corbyn 's base however sir keir urged the party not to lurch to the right and said the case for a bold and radical labour government is as important as ever the human rights lawyer who was made queen 's counsel in 2002 served as head of the cps and accepted a knighthood in 2014

the police service of northern ireland complied with human rights laws he entered parliament as the mp for holborn and st pancras in 2015 meanwhile wigan mp ms nandy began her campaign in her constituency on saturday with a call for change from mr corbyn 's approach we need a different sort of leadership that helps to root us back in every community across the uk turns us back into a real movement and real force driven from the ground up so that we can win people 's trust back she said birmingham yardley mp ms phillips visited the bury north constituency that fell from labour to the tories on december 12 to meet former supporters of the party meanwhile senior labour mp david lammy ruled himself out of the leadership contest suggesting his anti - brexit stance rendered him

in order to regain power she said we need a different sort of leadership that helps to root us back in every community across the uk turns us back into a real movement and real force driven from the ground up so that we can win peoples trust back we ve been wiped out in scotland virtually we ve seen the red wall crumble in the north and midlands and parts of north wales we ve been told over and over again by people in what were our former labour heartlands that we need to change we ca nt just keep changing the man at the top and making decisions from victoria street in london and think we can fix things for people a former mps assistant charity worker and councillor in london before becoming the wigan mp ms nandy said i was born and brought up in manchester went to college over in bury in lancashire i spent time as a london councillor i worked with homeless teenagers in soho spent 10 years living in wigan this is my community this is where my family is raised born and bred and i could nt care more about winning back votes this really matters to me i do have skin in the game i m not unlike many of my colleagues like that but i ve heard loud and clear what people have been telling us in places like leigh ashfield easington where we felt the ground collapse beneath our feet a few weeks ago this has been a long time coming for the labour party if elected labour leader ms nandy said she would like to see power moved from outside london and into local towns and regions whose decisions will impact on that community she said and what we ve heard from people for almost 20 years now is that has to change its a problem for the tories its a problem for every political party but absolutely existential for the labour party because we ve never been movement that s been about a small group of people coming in saying we will come in and fix things for you we were a movement founded by and for working people who wanted to effect change in their own lives themselves and we have to become that again ms nandy was critical of labour 's free broadband pledge but refused to decline a clean break from corbyn 's leadership saying she was like him in many ways she said labour

line speak truth win power she will kick off her campaign on saturday with a visit to bury north a seat lost to the tories in december 's election meanwhile wigan mp ms nandy a former shadow cabinet minister announced her candidacy in a letter to the wigan post saying she has a deeper understanding of what has gone awry in our discredited political system having represented her constituents since 2010 ms nandy and ms phillips join shadow foreign secretary emily thornberry and shadow treasury minister clive lewis as those to have formally declared their bids shadow brexit secretary sir keir starmer close corbyn ally rebecca long bailey and wigan mp lisa nandy are also considering leadership bids yvette cooper and ian lavery are also thought to be weighing up their support launching her campaign ms phillips said it was important for labour to learn from the mistakes of the 2019 election that saw the party lose traditional heartlands to the conservative party that helped give boris johnson a big majority the birmingham yardley mp said labour needed to elect a leader who gets it adding the party needed to be brave and bold in where they stood against a prime minister who blusters and lies labour needs a leader who will speak truth to both the party and the country she said in a statement she continued i was nt sure if i was going to stand in this contest but listening to the debate in the days after the election i thought we ve got to elect someone who gets it someone who understands how serious this defeat was were a party named after the working class who has lost huge parts of its working class base unless we address that we are in big trouble how does a labour leadership election work labour leadership race heats up as party in fighting continues will labour 's next leader be female the remain backing mp said labour 's attempt to try to appeal to everyone usually means we have pleased no one now is not the time to be meek boris johnson needs to be challenged with passion heart and precision we can beat him we need to speak to people 's hearts and people need to believe we really mean it when we do she continued the video features ms phillips in her constituency of birmingham yardley and in delyn north wales another seat that labour lost to the tories which labour had held since 1992 where she is seen speaking to local people ms nandy a former shadow cabinet minister said on friday that the successor must be someone with skin in the game and called for the rejection of the paternalism of the past she became one of the most prominent labour voices for the result of the eu referendum to be implemented and criticising calls for another public vote without what were once our labour heartlands we will never win power in westminster and help to build the country we know we can be she said i have heard you loud and clear when you said to earn that trust means we need a leader who is proud to be from those communities has skin in the game and is prepared to go out listen and bring labour home to you she said delivering brexit should not mean turning our backs on decency tolerance kindness it breaks my heart that in this election so many of you felt you had no choice but to vote for a tory party that has sent a wrecking ball through our community over the last decade ms nandy added bermondsey and old southwark mp neil coyle has thrown his weight behind ms phillips telling itv news political correspondent paul brand she was a breath of fresh air richard burgon enters race for labour deputy leader rebecca long bailey confirms she is considering labour leadership bid asked if her opposition to mr corbyn over the years would be seen by members as a betrayal of their own support for the islington north mp mr coyle said they have to look and they have to be honest with themselves whether they want labour policies whether they want to be government whether they want to transform people 's lives or not labour is in a very very deep hole and we absolutely have to have a leader who can reconnect and reconnect very quickly with and i think jess has buckets of charisma and will be able to connect to communities need to hear from us better famous for not mincing her words mr coyle said ms phillips ' straight talking honest voice was what people wanted to hear from the labour party vicky foxcroft mp for lewisham deptford said she would be supporting ms nandy in the campaign she 's been saying for a long time and continues to say we ca n't ignore the issues that towns are raising of course brexit was an issue but actually there 's lots of other issues an early survey puts sir keir ahead of beat ms long bailey in a run off 61 % to 39 % paul brand itv news political correspondent gives his analysis on jess phillips jess phillips strength is also her weakness perceived as an outspoken down to earth candidate her team think she has the common touch they recognise that she s an outsider but tell me that allows her to take some pretty big risks in this race do nt expect her to censor her typically fruity language but it is her ability to say it how she sees it that also hinders her in this contest her previously brutal assessments of jeremy corbyn and the labour leadership have made her a divisive figure among the membership many of whom are deeply loyal to their current leader and having also been a vocal critic of brexit the party will have to decide whether she can really appeal to leave voters in the midlands and north of england who have abandoned labour in their droves there s a reason why not many politicians speak their minds the way jess phillips does its too easy to offend people by telling them what you re really thinking labour mp jess phillips is poised to announce her candidacy in the race to succeed jeremy corbyn as party leader the backbencher is expected to announce her widely anticipated bid for leadership following labour 's worst performance at a general election since 1935 the birmingham yardley mp will join shadow foreign secretary emily thornberry and shadow treasury minister clive lewis as those to have formally declared their bids keir starmer favourite to succeed corbyn poll richard burgon enters race for labour deputy leader others who are also considering leadership bids include shadow brexit secretary sir keir starmer close corbyn ally rebecca long bailey and wigan mp lisa nandy yvette cooper is also thought to be considering her options too ms phillips has previously laid out her vision of leadership in the acting prime minister podcast with itv news political correspondent paul brand brand says her team plan to run a pretty bold campaign and are willing to take big risks to help push her position in the leadership race she appears to be a popular choice among labour members where she came third in a yougov survey of the membership behind both sir keir and shadow business secretary ms long bailey sir keir would beat ms long bailey who is the favoured candidate of key figures in the current leadership in a run off 61 % to 39 % according to the early survey but the other candidates will be hoping to boost their profiles with the race not expected to formally get under way until tuesday and a new leader not expected until the end of march labours election performance that helped boris johnsons tories win an 80-strong majority has been the subject of an intense post - mortem examination the partys brexit position mr corbyns unpopularity and his ambitious left wing programme have all been the subject of scrutiny president trumps decision to assassinate qassem soleimani accelerates perhaps the most important post - brexit decision faced by boris johnson whether to stand with the us or the eu at moments of potentially acute global crisis what happens next will largely be conditioned by how iran responds and retaliates but all western governments are examining their options in particular frances president macron will be working hard to forge a coordinated eu and european response not least because through the g7 over the summer he endeavoured to engineer a dialogue between president trump and iran those close to macron say he admires johnson who was iranian general qassem soleimani nazanin zaghari ratcliffes husband worried for his wife following air strike but there are members of the government who harbour the traditional british mistrust of a strong french president macron is hell bent on his ego one told me if the word macron were substituted with trump other members of the uk foreign policy establishment would not demur for what it is worth my strong sense is that the british government is giving trump the benefit of the doubt that ministers are framing the assassination as a proportionate response to a perceived iranian threat to us personnel and commercial interests but if macron merkel and the eu beg to differ johnson will be stuck in the middle faced with a conflict of loyalties that could have profound consequences for whether the uk is perceived to be even more detached from the continent of europe than is the inevitable consequence of brexit a liberal democrat mp has come out as pansexual and criticised parliament as a weird backwards place for lgbtq people layla moran said it was surprising for her when she started a relationship with a woman but said her sexuality was not about physical attributions of the person you fall in love with its about the person themselves it differs from bisexuality where people are attracted to more than one gender because pansexuals describe not recognising gender as part of their attraction in an interview with the pinknews website published on thursday the 37-year old said she had previously only had relationships with men but about six months ago she started a relationship with a woman she met through work lgbtq people share how they revealed their sexuality to others for international coming out day in pictures thousands join pride celebrations around the world it was really wonderful on the one hand but also quite surprising for me in how i had identified before the oxford west and abingdon mp said it was nt really something i had done before or considered before but sometimes when you meet the right person it just kind of happens were in a really committed loving supportive relationship and i feel now is the time to talk about it because as an mp i spend a lot of my time defending our community and talking about our community i want people to know i am part of our community as well she said coming out in the context of being an mp had been slightly more difficult than telling her friends and family when it became more widely known that we were together i was quite shocked actually she said there were a few people who said how serious is this and some people even overtly said do nt you think it would be better for your career if you were nt together they definitely would not have said anything like that had she been a man parliament is a weird backwards place i do nt know if there s any other mps who would identify as pansexual and not that many who identify as bisexual there are a few women who are brilliant role models who have come out in their lesbian relationships ms moran who did not rule out running to take over as lib dem leader was asked to describe pansexuality to someone who is not familiar with the term pansexuality to me means it does nt matter about the physical attributions of the person you fall in love with its about the person themselves she said it does nt matter if they re a man or a woman or gender non - conforming it does nt matter if they identify as gay or not in the end these are all things that do nt matter the thing that matters is the person and that you love the person boris johnsons key adviser dominic cummings has called for weirdos to apply for jobs in downing street as he seeks to overhaul decision making in government mr cummings posted an apparent job advert on thursday saying number 10 wants to hire an unusual set of people with different skills and backgrounds to work as special advisers and potentially officials the blog post exceeding 2,900 words came amid reports that the prime minister is planning seismic changes to the civil service mr cummings a former vote leave director said he hopes to be made largely redundant within a year by the recruitment drive he called for officials including weirdos and misfits with odd skills data scientists and policy experts to apply to a gmail account if they think they fit the bill mr cummings warned that there is some profound problems at the core of how the british state makes decisions and that he currently makes decisions well outside his circle of competence and he says the need for change comes with brexit requiring large policy and decision making structure changes and a government with an 80-strong majority having little need to worry about short term unpopularity under a subsection on hiring super - talented weirdos he writes that the government needs some true wild cards artists people who never went to university and fought their way out of an appalling hell hole mr cummings post came after rachel wolf who helped draw up the blueprint of tory election pledges said civil servants could be made to take regular exams to prove they are up to their whitehall jobs under seismic changes being planned by number 10 she also said that civil servants are woefully unprepared for sweeping reforms that mr johnson is keen to push through dave penman the general secretary of the fda which represents senior civil servants warned that the pms allies are exhibiting a fundamental misunderstanding of the modern civil service video report by itv news correspondent peter smith talks to restore powersharing to the devolved northern ireland government have resumed the latest round of talks begun after the general election but were put on hold during the christmas period secretary of state julian smith irish foreign affairs minister simon coveney and the local parties returned to stormont house on thursday morning to resume the effort the dup and sinn finn are holding separate talks with mr smith before holding talks with other parties and the irish government agreement to resurrect stormont must be sustainable dup from thursday morning a number of protesters stating their opposition to an irish language act being included in any potential deal set up camp outside the talks venue holding aloft union flags three years on from the collapse of the devolved government the stormont parties have until a january 13 deadline to strike a deal to revive the institutions on that date legislation to give civil servants additional powers to run northern ireland 's struggling public services expires and mr smith will assume a legal obligation to call a snap assembly election the latest push to restore powersharing broke up the week before christmas with uk and irish governments singling out the dup as the party standing in the way of a deal the party rejected the claims insisting it would not be bounced into a quick fix that falls apart when tested devolution can only be restored once the dup and sinn fein the region 's two largest parties agree terms to re - enter a mandatory coalition executive in belfast the other three main parties the sdlp ulster unionists and alliance are also involved in the talks process convened by the uk and irish governments while they could take positions in any new executive their sign off on a deal is not essential and a government could be formed in their absence with those parties having the option of going into opposition expectations of a breakthrough rose after the dup and sinn fein both suffered bruising results in the general election with many interpreting the outcome as a public judgment on the parties ' failure to do a deal stalled efforts to restore the institutions appeared to gain fresh momentum in december however proposals to reform a contentious cross - community voting mechanism in the assembly have emerged as a key sticking point in efforts to finalise an agreement with the dup unhappy about what is being countenanced the dup is also seeking changes to ensure the devolved institutions are more stable in future and can not be readily pulled down proposed legislative protections for irish language speakers are another crucial element of the negotiations the stormont parties are also seeking firm commitments from the uk government on a financial package to accompany the return of devolution money that would likely be targeted at the region 's crisis hit health service mr smith and mr coveney were in belfast on new year 's day for pre - talks discussions ahead of the resumption of formal exchanges with the political parties mr coveney urged the parties to show leadership and generosity he said the new year offered a chance for a new beginning and urged all sides not to disappoint the public again the leaders of the dup and sinn fein used their respective new year messages to restate a desire to return to government dup leader arlene foster said her party stood ready to restore devolution through a fair and balanced deal a northern ireland that is going to keeping moving forward must be one where everyone feels at home but must also be one where no one feels their culture is being marginalised she said stormont grounded to a halt three years ago this month when the late sinn fein deputy first minister martin mcguinness resigned in protest at the dup 's handling of a botched green energy scheme that dispute soon widened to encompass traditional rifts over issues such the irish language and the toxic legacy of the troubles a logjam over proposals to reform the petition of concern voting mechanism was one of the main reasons a deal failed to materialise before christmas it was designed to protect minority rights but politicians have accused each other of misusing it for their own ends discussions around change are focused on making it more difficult for one party to use the petition to block controversial legislation the parties are also considering amending assembly rules to make it harder to collapse the institutions shadow justice secretary richard burgon has said he is to run for labour deputy leader arguing the party must not abandon the policies of jeremy corbyn the left winger said it would be wrong to point the finger of blame at mr corbyn for labours devastating general election defeat instead he said that the party had lost out to the tories in a contest where the overriding issue of brexit had triumphed over traditional party loyalties his decision to stand could pitch him into a contest with shadow education secretary angela rayner who is reported to be considering a run for the deputy post vacated by tom watson ms rayner had been touted as a contender for the top job but was said to have decided to stand aside to give her close friend shadow business secretary rebecca long bailey a clear run as the favourite of the left shadow women and equalities secretary dawn butler another left wing ally of mr corbyn has already declared that she is a candidate for the deputy leadership in a recent article for the tribune magazine mr burgon rejected criticism of mr corbyn over the partys election performance saying that in the 2017 election he increased labours vote by 3.5 million how does a labour leadership election work peston why keir starmer is the labour leadership candidate to beat given that we had the same leader in jeremy corbyn and a similar manifesto to 2017 i think it is mistaken to focus blame there he said nobody campaigned with greater energy resilience and principle than jeremy and all of us in the shadow cabinet need to accept responsibility we ca nt allow blame for this election to fall on jeremys shoulders alone mr burgon also defended the partys election manifesto saying it would be wrong to abandon its promised green industrial revolution in favour of a return to market driven economics others may think that we need to triangulate instead the evidence does not support this he said will labour 's next leader be female a weakening of labours popular commitments to ending austerity returning rail mail and water to public ownership and a more interventionist role for the state would not win more votes change is going to be needed but we need to ensure we do nt throw the baby out with the bathwater mr burgon said more than 50 of the 60 seats lost by labour had been in leave supporting areas and called on whoever becomes the next leader to establish a special commission to look into how they could be won back when campaigning in many constituencies across the north and midlands as i did i heard people say they were lending their vote to the conservatives he said we certainly ca nt take it for granted that those voters or labour voters who stayed at home will back us next time scotland shows what can happen when people break with their pattern of voting for labour boris johnson has hailed the 2020s as a decade of prosperity and opportunity for post - brexit britain saying the uk can turn the page on the division of the previous three years in his new year message the prime minister said a new chapter in the history of our country will begin once he has achieved the first item in his priorities taking the uk out the eu by january 31 he said along with brexit and 2019 the country can also say goodbye to the rancour and uncertainty which has dominated public life and held us back for far too long mr johnson said that means the uk must come together and move forward united unleashing the enormous potential of the british people mr johnson who is spending new year with his girlfriend carrie symonds on the private island of mustique in the caribbean said he is determined to be a prime minister for everyone including the millions who backed remain or did not vote conservative in the general election corbyn were on the front line against johnsons government boris johnson given motorbike for christmas by girlfriend if you are one of them i want to reassure you that i will be a prime minister for everyone not just those who voted for me he said in an attempt to quell concerns about the future of the nhs the prime minister said leaving the eu would enable the government finally to focus on the people 's priorities the loudest message i heard during the election campaign is that people expect us expect me to protect and improve the nhs he said what will make the headlines in 2020 appalling reward new year honours marred by controversy the nhs is a wonderful british invention there for us and our families when we are ill whatever our background and regardless of ability to pay so the nhs will always be my top priority the prime minister said that he was also determined to make the uk the best place on earth for quality education and cutting edge science our vision is clear to unite and level up across the whole united kingdom spreading opportunity more fairly with better infrastructure superb education and high technology he said labour leader jeremy corbyn has used his new year message to say his party is the resistance against prime minister boris johnson and will be on the front line and on the streets opposing the government the outgoing leader made no reference to his partys defeat in the general election or his departure from the leadership despite announcing he will step down early next year in his address mr corbyn railed against billionaires and said labour will be on the front line both in parliament and on the streets mr corbyn conceded it had been quite a year for his party and called for the nhs and climate change to be top priorities for the next decade rebecca long bailey confirms she is considering labour leadership bid labour 's search for answers raises yet more questions about corbyn leadership ousted labour mps call for fundamental change in the partys leadership in the message mr corbyn said 2019 has been quite the year for our country and for our labour movement and now we are not just entering a new year but a new decade and the period ahead could not be more important it will be crucial if we are to stop irreversible damage being caused by the climate crisis and the particular effects that has on people in the global south if we are to stop the pain plaguing our country food banks poverty and people struggling to get by if we are to protect our precious nhs it wo nt be easy but we have built a movement we are the resistance to boris johnson we will be campaigning every day we will be on the front line both in parliament and on the streets mr corbyn said labour will be protecting our public services protecting healthcare free at the point of use protecting our communities in all their brilliant diversity and standing up for internationalism global solidarity and co - operation and working with movements and parties seeking social justice and change all over the world he added and make no mistake our movement is very strong we are half a million people and growing we are in every region and nation of our country were not backed by the press barons by the billionaires or by the millionaires who work for the billionaires were backed by you we are by the many for the many 2020 and the years ahead will be tough no one is saying otherwise but were up for the fight to protect what we hold dear and to build to win and to transform the fight continues there is no other choice so if you re with us already i ca nt wait to meet the challenges ahead together but if you re not join us join labour today together we can bring about real change for our country for the many and not just the few rebecca long bailey has said she is considering standing for labour leader becoming the latest mp to sound out an interest for the party 's top job in an article for the guardian in which she did not formally announce her candidacy ms long bailey said she would offer voters progressive patriotism the labour frontbencher avoided any criticism of jeremy corbyn 's leadership and said the party 's policies at the general election were popular among voters labour 's search for answers raises yet more questions about jeremy corbyn 's leadership former labour leader ed miliband to spearhead inquest into election defeat however she admitted her party 's stance on brexit satisfied too few she said we did nt lose because of our commitment to scrap universal credit invest in public services or abolish tuition fees ms long bailey also said the party needed to appeal to voters across the length and breadth of the country in order to return to power she said britain has a long history of patriotism rooted in working life built upon unity and pride in the common interests and shared life of everyone to win we must revive this progressive patriotism and solidarity in a form fit for modern britain emily thornberry and clive lewis have already formally entered the race to replace mr corbyn while several others have mooted interest including sir keir starmer lisa nandy jess phillips yvette cooper and david lammy it was a punishing general election defeat the fourth in a row and labour 's worst performance in terms of seats since 1935 it went deeper than that because the party saw its once loyal supporters switch to the tories yes the tories in areas that had elected labour mps for decades in some constituencies for nearly a century today 's letter to the observer signed by some of those former mps who lost their seats in former heartlands reads like a warning there 's a fear amongst those mps who are regarded as being either centrist or on the right of the party that the panel including former leader ed miliband set up to review why labour was defeated will produce a whitewash former labour leader ed miliband to spearhead inquest into election defeat read this line from today 's letter we need to be honest about why our outgoing leaderships reflexive anti - western worldview was so unpopular and address the reasons and the implication that can be drawn is that they worry the internal inquiry will not be honest about the reasons for the losses the blame lies with the corbyn leadership that 's the clear conclusion from this group of former mps who also claim that cronyism at the top of the party and repeated unwillingness to stand up to the stain of anti - semitism was another major factor in the defeat synagogue and shops daubed in anti - semitic graffiti on hanukkah with the key governing body labour 's national executive committee controlled by his allies and the membership largely seen as supportive jeremy corbyn and corbynism still dominate the internal mechanisms of the party the group of mps writing today are concerned that an unflinching inquiry into what went wrong will not be possible with the reins of the party still in the hands of the leader who oversaw such crushing losses an extra 35 million will be given to police and crime commissioners to tackle violent crime the home secretary has announced priti patel said the money would allow violence reduction units in the 18 areas worst affected by serious violence to continue their work set up earlier this year the units bring together organisations including the police local government health and community leaders to tackle violent crime by understanding its root causes police and crime commissioners pccs received 35 million to set up the centres in august and the announcement continues the funding for 2020/21 the metropolitan police area will receive the most money 7 million while greater manchester merseyside west midlands and west yorkshire will each get more 3.3 million south yorkshire

delivering on the peoples priorities by recruiting 20,000 new police officers and introducing tougher sentences to keep offenders behind bars for longer but agencies must also work together to tackle this issue head on these units are already playing a vital role in diverting young people away from crime and the funding i have announced today will allow them to continue this important work nottinghamshire pcc paddy tipping said we can embed and build on the projects already under way and support new initiatives designed to tackle serious violence this funding will provide security for our ambitions for the future a host of defeated labour mps and candidates have stressed that fundamental change is needed at the top of the party in the wake of its devastating election defeat in a letter penned to the observer the 11-strong group call for an unflinching review into exactly what led to the partys worst election defeat in 84 years the results saw the conservatives win an 80-seat majority while labour slumped to 202 its lowest number of seats since 1935 in the wake of the defeat labour leader jeremy corbyn said he would stand down in the new year with a new leader expected in march a panel including former labour leader ed miliband has been established to look at labour 's election failure the letter blamed the party 's leadership 's reflexive anti - western worldview and repeated unwillingness to stand up to the stain of anti - semitism appalling reward new year honours marred by controversy ben stokes olivia newton john and a d day veteran head new year honours list johnson and corbyn praise nhs staff and armed forces working over christmas we have been horrified by the damage that tory government austerity has wreaked in our communities crippling our nhs starving our struggling schools and transport networks normalising street sleeping and failing to keep our streets safe the letter said yet sadly when it came to polling day labour was led to its biggest defeat since 1935 we lost seats in every region and nation with a swing against us in every social class with the biggest swing against us from the poorest people the scale of this defeat means that we have to look unflinchingly at what went wrong way beyond a simple review welcome as that might be we need to be honest about why our outgoing leaderships reflexive anti - western worldview was so unpopular and address the reasons according to the group which includes former mps mary creagh emma reynolds and anna turley the partys defeat stemmed primarily from a focus on nationalisation and uncontrolled spending commitments as well as cronyism at the top of the party and repeated unwillingness to stand up to the stain of anti - semitism we are devastated that across the country we can no longer help our residents to whom we have devoted ourselves still struggling under a tory government they wrote it is our duty to speak up now so that our leadership candidates keep these people at the heart of their campaigns to lead our party the challenge for the eventual winner is immense we need to win 150 seats in every corner of the country gaining votes from a coalition of communities labour needs to be in government and for that fundamental change at the top of our party is required only this will help us recover from the catastrophic loss of 12 december senior labour figures should pay price for defeat not juniors says thornberry labour leadership hopeful emily thornberry launches attack on corbyn 's advisers how does a labour leadership election work video report by itv news correspondent rebecca barry the new years honours list has been met with controversy with awards for englands world cup winners and entertainers lauded while recognition for two prominent figures from politics and the legal profession has drawn condemnation cricketers including ben stokes have been honoured for clinching the world cup on home soil while singers sir elton john and olivia newton john have also received awards as has filmmaker sam mendes but the bestowing of a damehood on former director of public prosecutions dpp alison saunders and a knighthood for former conservative party leader iain duncan smith have sparked a backlash ms saunders was made a dame commander of the order of the bath for services to criminal justice despite quitting the post last year after several controversies stokes newton john and a d day veteran head new year honours list these included overseeing the infamous disclosure scandal in which dozens of rape trials collapsed due to the late disclosure of evidence leading to a review of every rape case in the country dame alison also attracted criticism for the handling of other sex crime allegations and investigations during her term including claims made against the late lord janner and broadcaster paul gambaccini who was paid a settlement over his wrongful arrest as part of operation yewtree despite usual practice dame alison did not receive an honour after quitting as head of the crown prosecution service cps in october last year her award was believed to have been withheld after then

pensions secretary under david cameron sir iain was the architect of the governments controversial universal credit welfare reforms opposition parties said it beggared belief that someone whose policies had caused so much distress should be honoured in this way labours lisa nandy lambasted the award tweeting it was a disgraceful decision by boris johnson to reward a legacy of cruelty and failure this regime deliberately removed the safety net it stripped people of their dignity there is no honour in that she added a labour party spokesman said it was unfortunate to see that one of boris johnsons first priorities was to grant a knighthood to sir iain the primary architect of the cruel universal credit system which has pushed thousands of people into poverty the european union and britain will struggle to seal an agreement on trade and other aspects of their future ties after brexit next year and should consider extending the negotiations beyond 2020 a top eu official said in an interview published friday the uk is scheduled to leave the eu on january 31 if it does it will be the first time a country leaves the world 's biggest trading bloc negotiations between the remaining members and the british government on future trade fisheries education and transport relations can only begin after that date and must conclude by the end of 2020 i am very concerned about how little time we have european commission president ursula von der leyen told the french business newspaper les echos it seems to me that on both sides we should seriously consider whether the negotiations are feasible in such a short time i think it would be reasonable to take stock in the middle of the year and if necessary agree on an extension to the transition period von der leyen said johnson sidesteps allegations he has put britain on course for a harder brexit as the leader of the executive commission von der leyen heads the eu institution responsible for brexit talks and negotiating trade deals on behalf of member countries such trade pacts routinely take years to complete and businesses fear that the uk could face a new no deal brexit scenario at the start of 2021 if questions about whether tariff free trade with the country 's biggest trading partner remain unanswered but prime minister boris johnson has insisted he would not agree to any delays johnson won a solid parliamentary majority in an election earlier this month which helped him push a brexit withdrawal deal through lower parliament the brexit bill contained amendments that bar the british government from extending the transition period beyond 2020 under article 50 of the eu 's lisbon treaty rule book which governs how countries leave the bloc any new extension to the departure process must be agreed by june 30 2020 who s who in the eu the four key players in the next stages of brexit boris johnson and jeremy corbyn have paid tribute to nhs staff and other public servants working through the holidays in their annual christmas messages while the two leaders both praised the efforts of those who were putting their celebrations on hold to look after others the tone of their messages could hardly be more different the prime minister still basking in his general election triumph began his video with a jaunty hi folks boris johnson here taking a moment to wish you all a merry little christmas after praising the armed forces for keeping our country safe and a huge part of the world in peace and security he urged people to enjoy the next few days adding try not to have too many arguments with the in laws or anyone else possible leadership contender nandy asks ex - labour voters why they backed tories labour leadership race heats up as party in fighting continues mr johnson also sent another tweet thanking nhs staff for working so hard to take care of us especially over the christmas period in contrast mr corbyn in what will almost certainly be his last christmas message as labour leader reflected ruefully on his catastrophic defeat while expressing his hope for a better world this has been a difficult year for many of us we did nt succeed in delivering the change that so many people so desperately need he said but christmas is a chance to listen reflect and remember all the things that bind us together our compassion our determination to tackle injustice and our hope for a better world mr corbyn said it was a time of year the when the scale of injustice and inequality is in very plain sight and he praised those working in food banks and emergency shelters helping the less fortunate while we celebrate being together we are reminded of the many who will be alone and sadly lonely at christmas he said but our communities are built on generosity and the solidarity that comes from that so we do not walk by on the other side in his message mr johnson who will be spending his first christmas as prime minister in downing street with his girlfriend carrie symonds thanked those in the nhs the police and other public services who would be working over the holiday as well as military personnel on deployment with the armed forces he also spoke of the christians around the world who were facing persecution for their beliefs for them christmas day will be marked in private in secret perhaps even in a prison cell he said as prime minister that s something i want to change we stand with christians everywhere in solidarity and will defend your right to practice your faith so as a country let us reflect on the year and celebrate the good that is to come in his christmas message acting liberal democrat leader sir ed davey spoke about his christian faith he said as a christian for me its all about hope and joy and love what could possibly represent hope joy and love better than a new born baby when i held my first child in the crook of my arm in kingston hospital just minutes after he d been born that was the first time i really understood how my own father and mother must have loved me so you do nt actually have to believe in jesus to recognise that for christians christmas has a deep profound meaning whoever is the next leader of the labour party will have to understand why they lost a seat like ashfield this is a former mining community that has nearly always voted labour and yet this time voted conservative the wigan mp lisa nandy is seriously considering a leadership bid and today itv news accompanied her around ashfield to hear what the voters had to say first door she knocked on the door of a man who tells her he s been labour all his life a working class voter a union member but then comes the but and this time the but is mr corbyn you must have heard it thousands of times wrong policies we do nt want to be back in the 70s the ashfield resident says he voted conservative former labour leader ed miliband to spearhead inquest into election defeat labour leadership race heats up as party in fighting continues thornberry enters labour leadership race as starmer seriously considers it clive lewis announces he plans to stand in the labour leadership contest in a coffee shop ms nandy meets ken taylor a former miner himself mr taylor is scathing about the tories i do nt like conservatives never have liked conservatives but i voted conservative brexit is part of the reason we voted to leave and they just disrespected that totally he says of labour but brexit is only one part of mr taylor 's issue with labour mr taylor also feels labour has become all about what londoners think and what students think not about what northern working class voters think talking to me in the pub afterwards lisa nandy says all this is heartbreaking she believes she can stitch labours traditional wings often described as the workers and the intellectuals back together but labours next leader whoever that might be not only has to win back seats they have recently lost they also have to reach out to places that labour has not won for a long time the race for the labour leadership has heated up after two remain backing candidates hinted they could put their names forward for the top two jobs long standing tottenham mp david lammy gave the clearest indication yet that he was mulling entering the contest to replace jeremy corbyn as leader who announced he would step down after labours disastrous showing at the polls and tooting mp rosena allin khan confirmed in an interview with the sunday times that she was considering entering the race for deputy leader in an article for the observer newspaper on sunday mr lammy said mr corbyns mind boggling decision to abdicate leadership and remain neutral on brexit was one of the main factors behind labours largest election defeat since 1935 mr lammy said he wanted to see an end to tribalism in british politics reform to the unfair voting system and a trial of universal basic income a scheme where everyone in society is paid a small salary by the state thornberry enters labour leadership race as starmer seriously considers it clive lewis announces he plans to stand in the labour leadership contest the arch remainer who was elected in 2000 and has more than 500,000 twitter followers said he would consider over christmas which labour figure i believe is best placed to lead this hopeful vision if elected by members to the top job he would become the first black or ethnic minority leader of the labour party only shadow foreign secretary emily thornberry and shadow treasury minister clive lewis have so far officially declared their candidacy but more are expected to follow early next year shadow brexit secretary sir keir starmer has said he is seriously considering running dr allin khan meanwhile could be in the frame to replace former deputy tom watson who stood down as an mp before the election she saw her profile rise during the election after boris johnson copied her idea of imitating a scene from christmas comedy love actually in a campaign video the practising gp and shadow sports minister told the sunday times is it something i would like to do yes because i think i could bring a fresh non - tribal approach but i will have to have lots of conversations with my family and friends and make a decision in january shadow equalities minister dawn butler declared her intention to run before the disastrous poll result was revealed on december 12 other expected rivals include shadow justice secretary richard burgon and shadow education secretary angela rayner who is rumoured to be weighing up running on a joint leadership ticket with friend and flatmate rebecca long bailey leading a parallel bid to be leader as possible leadership candidates tested the waters before declaring factional in fighting broke out between those on the left and the centre of labour on sunday laura pidcock the corbyn ally who lost her north west durham seat at the election tweeted that the legacy of new labour and tony blair still hangs around this party like a millstone her comments were made after mr blair still the last labour leader to win a general election intervened last week blasting the misguided ideology the party had pursued under mr corbyn those from the new labour era were quick to round on ms pidcocks comments telling her wing of the party they must own the loss of 59 labour held seats ex home secretary jacqui smith said i m sorry you lost your seat but it was down to the unelectability sic of the leader and the project you championed you need to own that rather than try to shift the blame to a leader and politics that actually managed to win and change britain for the better blair attacks corbyn for turning labour into glorified protest movement during mr blairs third and final election victory in 2005 labour held ms pidcocks seat with a 13,000 majority it was lost to the tories on december 12 with a 1,144 vote majority making it the first time the constituency has not been represented by a labour mp since 1914 the sunday times reported that a leak of labours secret list of target seats at the election a document allegedly shared with a trade union showed the party targeted a number of conservative constituencies in a bid to make gains target seats such as mansfield ended up with blue majorities of more than 15,000 while only putney out of a list of 60 targets was a labour gain on the night boris johnson has arrived in estonia and helped serve a christmas lunch to british troops stationed in the country the prime minister took an raf a330 plane for the one day trip to the baltic state on saturday morning he wished troops a merry christmas in estonian as he served them turkey and yorkshire puddings in the base 's canteen mr johnson donning a red apron asked soldiers who wants turkey and told them to form an orderly queue as he served food to dozens of troops eu braced for harder brexit as boris johnson rules out following brussels rules awkward how leaders at loggerheads posed together in nato photo many soldiers posed for selfies with him as he dished out yorkshire puddings he asked one troop are you enjoying it here before remarking in reference to the grey skies it 's quite sort of bleak is n't it mr johnson then toured the canteen greeting soldiers as they tucked into their christmas lunches the pm had a bite of chocolate cake as he sat down on one table where he chatted to troops about rugby russia and their alcohol restrictions while on base he told them last time i was here they let me drive a tank that did n't seem to be on the agenda today what is nato what will be discussed and how much does it cost addressing troops in a vehicle hanger on the base mr johnson thanked them for their work and wished them a merry christmas in the course of the next few days everybody in our country is going to be celebrating christmas with their families and you 're going to be here a long way away a pretty cold place what you 're doing is incredibly important because the reason everybody in our country can have christmas in peace and security is because of what you 're doing here what you 're doing is showing that nato works and that nato is an alliance to which we in this country are absolutely committed to mr johnson said the troops were the most vivid and powerful possible symbol and expression that britain is committed to the security and stability of the whole of europe it 's an incredible thing for me to come to estonia because when i was a kid when i was your age estonia was part of the soviet union and we 're now here helping to protect estonia 's security it 's a fantastic thing and it 's a deeply moving thing for someone from my generation the prime minister added thank you very much for what you 're doing i hope you have a very very peaceful happy time and have a happy christmas everybody boris johnsons chief aide in downing street dominic cummings is paid three times the average uk salary a

theresa may while the conservative leaders personal advisory team has expanded to 44 from 37 during mrs mays tenure boris johnson appeared to set himself on a collision course with the european union in trade talks after ruling out adhering to brussels rules after brexit a huge majority of 124 votes for the eu withdrawal agreement bill at its second reading in the commons on friday means the uk is on its way to finalising its divorce from brussels by the january 31 deadline but opposing views on both sides of the channel mean that the prime minister is set for a combative 11-months of trade talks when uk and eu teams sit down to negotiate from february irish prime minister leo varadkar warned that mr johnson looked to be embarked on a harder brexit than we anticipated and said he feared the uk wanted to undercut europe on food health and product safety after it exits conservative party leader mr johnson told mps on friday that the oven was on when it came to delivering brexit next year but said there would be no alignment to eu rules once the transition period ends in 2020 he said the bill ensures that the implementation period must end on december 31 next year with no possibility of an extension and it paves the way for a new agreement on our future relationship with our european neighbours based on an ambitious free trade agreement brexit a to z key terms relating to britains departure explained boris johnson to legislate to rule out extension of eu ' transition reveals robert peston this will be with no alignment on eu rules but instead with control of our own laws and close and friendly relations charles michel the successor to donald tusk as european council president welcomed the commons result but suggested in a tweet that a level playing field remains a must for any future relationship taoiseach mr varadkar warned a good trade deal for ireland was looking increasingly unlikely after the stance taken by number 10 since the tories thumping general election win it is going to be difficult to secure a good trade deal for ireland principally because boris johnson has fixed on a harder brexit than we anticipated under his predecessor or at the time of the referendum and that is one where he talks very much about divergence he told journalists in dublin the harder approach being taken by prime minister johnson is a risk to us and that is evident mr varadkar said he feared the uk under a hard brexit would look to undercut eu member states on food financial product and health standards in order to compete for world trade before those talks begin the pm will look to switch off from brexit over the christmas break an example number 10 is rumoured to have told all ministers to follow the pm will turn his attention to other issues when he

term investment in defence speaking to bbc radio 4s political thinking podcast the cabinet minister said the best thing i can do for the men and women of the armed forces is to make sure that we cut our cloth to match our ambition that manage expectations and say to the service chiefs that your appetite has to match your stomach by doing so we build our credibility with the treasury and number 10 to say look we have sorted out our house when you give us some more money we will deliver on what were trying to do and there will be no tricks he also confirmed reports that the pms chief adviser dominic cummings will be involved in a major shake up of defence procurement after the strategist wrote a number of scathing blogs about the ministry of defence before joining the government mr wallace added dom is full of amazing ideas where he has spotted loads of improvement in infrastructure and technology procurement and he has spotted how that as our technology horizon changes how we procure has to happen differently and i am incredibly supportive of what he is talking about the controversial appointment of zac goldsmith to the house of lords by boris johnson has been compounded by a tweet he sent in 2012 criticising the peerage system mr goldsmith has been accused of hypocrisy on social media over the tweet and is now able to retain his role as environment minister as a result of his new title downing street has dismissed allegations of cronyism over the appointment of mr goldsmith the ousted tory mp to the lords so he can keep his job in the government his appointment came after nicky morgan controversially kept her cabinet post as culture secretary despite standing down as an mp at last weeks election when she was made a life peer asked about the criticism mr johnson 's official spokesman said zac goldsmith was doing an excellent and committed job in cabinet dealing with really important issues and he will now be able to get on with that work and carry on delivering the spokesman repeated his praise when asked if it was reasonable to swiftly reward an mp who lost to the liberal democrats by 7,766 votes number 10 declined to directly comment on the environment ministers apparent previous criticism of the peerage system in the 2012 tweet labour has accused mr johnson of using the peerage system to appoint jobs for mates after voters in richmond park emphatically rejected mr goldsmith in the general election the spokesman was unable to say how mr johnson convinced the minister to stay on saying i do nt have details of any conversations mr johnson 's partner carrie symonds worked on the life peer 's failed bid to succeed mr johnson as london mayor shadow culture minister jon trickett said mr goldsmith whose failed london mayoral campaign against labours sadiq khan in 2016 was mired in allegations of racism accused the government of cronyism it says everything you need to know about boris johnsons respect for democracy that he has ignored the voters of richmond park and appointed goldsmith to government he said the public deserve better than a government appointed by jobs for mates at a time when the conservatives are investigating racism in their party they ve appointed the person who ran an overtly racist campaign against sadiq khan zac goldsmith is not fit to hold any government position lib dem sarah olney who took the remain supporting constituency from mr goldsmith who backed brexit echoed the allegations of cronyism it is the first days of parliament returning and already boris

labour era in terms of policy and personnel the party was never able to communicate this to voters in our heartlands said the mp of four years when trying to persuade them of our radicalism and sincerity we often had the legacy of the 2000s thrown back in our faces persuading voters that we understand the sources of their long held resentment and frustration of their disappointment in how labour has conducted itself since the 1990s will be the first step towards winning back their trust rachael maskell mp for york central has been quick out of the blocks to endorse mr lewis for leader the contest to succeed mr corbyn has yet to officially start but a number of other candidates are expected to declare in the coming weeks shadow business secretary rebecca long bailey is said to be considering running while shadow brexit secretary sir keir starmer wigan mp lisa nandy and arch remainer and tottenham mp david lammy have all expressed interest ms thornberry in a pitch for the leadership on thursday called out the way in which she said mr corbyn was badly advised and undermined she said mr corbyn was badly let down and while she declined to name anyone specifically she said people know who it is that i m talking about it was put to ms thornberry on bbc radio 4s today programme that she was kept off the airwaves for much of the election campaign as she was asked what it has been like dealing with the corbyn regime see i do nt recognise that caricature she said i was obviously available and it was a matter not for me but for those making decisions during the election as to whether or not i was used and it was obviously a matter for them and i m a team player so i went off and worked in marginal seats which i thought was an important thing to do i think that jeremy has been badly let down i think that jeremy has been badly advised and i think that there have been a number of mistakes made between 2017 and 2019 that undermined him so fundamentally as i say i think he was let down the independent group for change a political party formed of labour and tory defectors has announced it is to disband after failing to hold any seats in the general election the group posted a statement to twitter saying it was right to shine a spotlight on britain 's broken politics but having taken stock it admitted now was right time to begin the process of winding up the party its leader ex - tory mp anna soubry wrote a letter to its members telling them political change was still needed but now that we no longer have voices within parliament a longer term realignment will have to take place in a different way honesty and realism are at the core of our values and we therefore must recognise that the political uncertainty of recent months has now given way to a settled pattern in parliament for the next five years so this is the right time for us to take stock the remain mps who lost their seat after leaving parties tory turned change uk mp sarah wollaston joins lib dems in fight against brexit luciana berger becomes latest defector to join liberal democrats acting pm chuka umunna on his messy year and why change uk failed it was a difficult time in british politics for the new political party which originally had seven former labour mps as members they were soon joined by four more mps three joining from the tories and they registered themselves as an official political party named change uk the registration was made in time for the party to compete in the european elections but it faced a drubbing in the poll and won zero seats after a poor showing in the eu election six of its mps left to either join the lib dems or to stand as independents then things got even worse for the party as its name was challenged by petition website change uk the group was forced to change its name to what it is currently called three independent group for change mps stood in the 2019 general election but none of them retained their seats former conservative mp zac goldsmith who lost his seat in the 2019 general election has been made a life peer and will retain his role as boris johnson 's environment minister the appointment to the house of lords had been widely expected for mr goldsmith who was the mp for richmond park after resigned mp nicky morgan was also made a life peer in order to remain in the cabinet the prime minister had been criticised and accused of cronyism following the appointment of ms morgan to the lords and it is likely those attacks will intensify former london mayor contender mr goldsmith lost his seat to the liberal democrats ' sarah olney last week with his support for brexit likely playing a role in his defeat downing street said the rt hon zac goldsmith has been confirmed as a minister of state unpaid

year old had a tough job of keeping his seat in the general election having won a slight majority of just 45 votes in the 2017 snap poll pro - brexit mr goldsmith was always an awkward fit in a constituency that voted 72 % remain in the eu referendum at the december 2019 election ms olney polled 34,559 votes compared to mr goldsmith 's 26,793 on a turnout of 79 % of the electorate in the

and will be enshrined in law with foreign doctors and nurses be able to work in the uk though a fast tack visa process the government aims to work with other parties on long term social care reforms and stated the system will provide people with dignity and security without having to sell their homes to pay for care but there were no precise details on how this would be implemented those most in need will get free hospital car parking and the mental health act will be reformed to give patients greater say over their care how will immigration be handled many of the points in the queen 's speech were not new including the introduction of australian style points based immigration system for skilled workers is there sufficient support for families and education plans to raise the national insurance threshold and increasing the national living wage are among measures to support working families and there were promises to increase funding per pupil in every school what is the stance on housing the government is keen on home ownership and there will be discounts for local first time buyers and a lifetime deposit initiative set up so tenants do not have to save for a new deposit each time they move house new measures will protect tenants with no fault evictions abolished but landlords will have more rights to get their properties back improving building safety an issue which came to the forefront of the national agenda following the grenfell tower tragedy was also mentioned but in what was a short queens speech there was no explicit mention on meeting the social housing need and tackling the homelessness crisis what about law and order a royal commission will review the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice process but there was little detail on how much money will be injected into the justice system new sentencing laws will ensure the most serious violent offenders including terrorists will spend longer in prison and quicker action will be taken on knife crime offenders what about security the government confirmed plans for the deepest review of britain 's security defence and foreign policy since the end of the cold war it covers the armed forces the intelligence agencies counter - terrorism and the future development of foreign policy there could also be a review of the official secrets act following the salisbury poisonings is climate change important for the government the government still plans to meet the environmental targets of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and have legally binding air quality improvement targets exports of pollution plastic waste to non - oecd organisation for economic co - operation and development countries will be banned although there was no further detail on plans to improve flood defence systems after the derbyshire floods last month what other key point was mentioned the fixed term parliaments act that sets out when general elections are held will be abolished allowing the prime minister to call an election without parliament 's consent the department for exiting the european union dexeu will be wound up on the day the uk leaves the eu the government has announced on january 31 the government plans to shut the department fronted by brexit secretary steven barclay and several staff members are expected to be out of a job a government spokesperson thanked all outgoing staff for all their work and said they will receive help finding new jobs established in 2016 following the brexit referendum the department is responsible for overseeing negotiations to leave the eu and establish the future relationship between the bloc and britain but boris johnson has vowed to take britain out of the bloc at the end of next month and will begin driving the necessary legislation through parliament from friday ex tory mp goldsmith retains environment minister role as he 's made life peer boris johnson 's queen 's speech the most radical in a generation the government 's decision to shut the department indicates senior figures believe it will be redundant following the uk 's departure from the eu but critics have said there will be lots more work to do on brexit during the transition period which is scheduled to run until the end of 2020 winding down the department follows reports that the pm is planning a major shake up of whitehall with suggestions that the best dexeu staff may join the cabinet office to boost numbers in britain 's eu negotiating team sturgeon formally writes to pm requesting powers to hold indyref2 where is the missing house of commons speaker wig other ideas floated include splitting energy and climate change from the business department again and merging the department for international trade with the business department the foreign office and the department for international development could also be aligned to shift the aid budget 's focus and ensure it aligns with foreign policy goals police have detained several hundred protesters in some of indias biggest cities as they defied a ban on assembly imposed to stop demonstrations against a new citizenship law opponents of the law say it threatens the countrys secular democracy dozens of demonstrations were planned around the country as opposition widened to the law which excludes muslims police response to protesters ' black day in the history of india the legislation has sparked anger at what many see as the hindu nationalist led governments push to bring india closer to a hindu state historian ramchandra guha a biographer of independence leader mohandas gandhi was among those detained in bangalore the capital of southern karnataka state the state government issued a ban on groups of more than four people gathering in new delhi yogendra yadav the chief of the swaraj india party was among those detained as protesters demonstrated at new delhis iconic red fort and the surrounding historic district officials said more than 100 people were detained at the fort dozens arrested in india as protests against citizenship legislation grow the main roads leading to the fort were blocked off and police did not let pedestrians go to nearby temples or shopping areas internet and phone services were blocked around the fort and in some other parts of new delhi a tactic indian authorities use in other parts of the country such as disputed kashmir to try to stop people from organising protests the measure however is rarely used in the capital the new citizenship law applies to hindus christians and other religious minorities who are in india illegally but can demonstrate religious persecution in muslim majority bangladesh pakistan and afghanistan it does not apply to muslims critics say it is the latest effort by prime minister narendra modis hindu nationalist led government to marginalise indias 200 million muslims and a violation of the countrys secular constitution mr modi has defended it as a humanitarian gesture the laws enactment last week follows a contentious process in the north eastern assam state intended to weed out people who entered illegally nearly two million people in assam were excluded from an official list of citizens about half hindu and half muslim and have been asked to prove their citizenship or else be considered foreign india is also building a detention centre for some of the tens of thousands of people the courts are expected to ultimately determine have entered illegally mr modis interior minister amit shah has pledged to roll out the process nationwide some muslims fear it is a way for hindu nationalists to detain them or deport them from the country on wednesday authorities tightened restrictions on protesters expanding a blockade of the internet and a curfew in assam video report by itv news political editor robert peston her majesty has delivered on behalf of prime minister boris johnson what he says is the most radical queen 's speech in a generation setting out the government 's main priorities mr johnson said his ambition for the country is nothing short of a complete transformation and claimed there is no time to waste in achieving it addressing mps after the speech mr johnson vowed that his government would work flat out to deliver a new golden age for the uk as he insisted his vision is for the long term this is not a programme for one year or one parliament it is a blueprint for the future of britain he said where is the missing house of commons speaker wig labour leadership hopeful emily thornberry launches attack on corbyn 's advisers but outgoing labour leader jeremy corbyn criticised conservative plans for social care and brexit as well as the party 's record on the nhs which he said is on its knees due to this tory government as this queen 's speech shows what the government is actually proposing is woefully inadequate for the scale problems that this country faces he told the commons it is mr johnson 's second queen 's speech as prime minister with one being delivered following his controversial prorogation of parliament the difference now is that the pm has a huge majority in the commons meaning he 's able to set out his vision without any worry mps may reject it of the 25 bills detailed in mr johnson 's second queen 's speech and another 11 outlined in accompanying documents seven are devoted to britain 's departure from the eu so what is actually in this queen 's speech summary as one journalist in the house of commons press gallery quipped there 's nothing in this queen 's speech that we have n't heard before though that may not be strictly true in the 151-page document there are nuggets that appear to be new plans such as the section on espionage legislation but mr johnson has largely taken the speech as an opportunity to bang the brexit drum using the much repeated analogy that his deal is pre - cooked ready to pop in the microwave he says the new parliament which is no longer in deadlock must work hard to maximise the opportunities of brexit so the his government can move on and focus on the people 's priorities nicola sturgeon independence referendum mandate unarguable tories sorry after mp was incorrectly named as first elected openly gay muslim there 's a plan to implement legislation that will block a further extension to the brexit transition period which is set to end at the end of 2020 he wants to pass this law to avoid the trap of further dither and delay to make way for his plans on the nhs police infrastructure and the rest many of the main pledges have already been stated for example 40 new nhs hospitals 50,000 new nurses 20,000 new police officers and plans for an australian style points based immigration system the state opening of parliament which follows last week 's general election took place without some of the traditional ceremony with the queen arriving by car rather than carriage and wearing a mint green dress and hat rather than her robes and state crown the main points the first priority of the queen 's speech is to deliver brexit on january 31 and to negotiate an ambitious free trade agreement with the eu aside from brexit here are the other main points in the queen 's speech investing in the nhs and other public services this section of the queen 's speech includes plans to deliver an nhs long term plan in england which will ensure the service is fit for the future a medicines and medical devices bill which aims to give patients faster access to innovative medicines there is a plan to reform social care and provide extra financing so that nobody needs to sell their home to pay for it the prime minister also wants to modernise and reform the mental health act to give patients greater say over their care he also pledges to increase funding so that all children can access a high quality education thornberry enters labour leadership race as starmer seriously considers it how does a labour leadership election work measures to support workers and families this section includes plans to enhance workers rights by supporting flexible working and ensuring workers keep their hard earned tips there is a plan to reduce the cost of living by increases to the national insurance threshold and the national living wage no fault evictions will be abolished and lifetime deposits introduced under new legislation to improve renters ' security but landlords will also be given strengthened powers to regain possession of their property under the renters ' reform bill announced in the queen 's speech on thursday the expansion of the database of rogue landlords is also included in the legislation to be introduced in parliament aimed at improving the rental market in england strengthening the criminal justice system the prime minister 's legislative programme includes bills which will ensure the most serious violent offenders including terrorists serve longer prison terms a royal commission will be established to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice process and the government will enshrine in law a commitment on the health service 's funding with an extra 33.9 billion per year provided by 2023/24 supporting the armed forces security and defence the speech confirmed plans for the deepest review of britain 's security defence and foreign policy since the end of the cold war led by the prime minister it will cover the armed forces the intelligence agencies and counter - terrorism as well as the future development of foreign policy the government will look at whether the official secrets act needs overhauling in the wake of the salisbury chemical weapons attack as well as considering whether there is a case for updating the treason laws improving infrastructure this section includes mr johnson 's much touted plan to provide all new homes with reliable and fast broadband he also wants the uk to remain a main player in global aviation by modernising airspace making journey 's quicker quieter and cleaner there will also be a further development of a plan to ensure customers can get home quickly when an airline goes bust as happened with thomas cook town centres will be kept vibrant through a plan to reform business rates which will protect high streets and communities from excessive tax hikes safeguarding the environment and tackling climate change the government says it will continue to work to meet environmental targets to halt the climate crisis one of the main promises is to meet the world leading target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 blair attacks corbyn for turning labour into glorified protest movement the plan also includes tacking air pollution and banning exports of pollution plastic waste to non - oecd organisation for economic co - operation and development countries to protect and improve the environment for future generations a bill will enshrine in law environmental principles and legally binding targets including for air quality the queen said espionage legislation buried deep within the queen 's speech document is a section on foreign espionage following the attack in salisbury on an ex - russian spy the purpose of the legislation is to provide security agencies with the tools they need to disrupt hostile state activity in the uk and around the world this will in turn make it more difficult for foreign adversaries to operate in the uk and strengthen the response to any threats the government plans to do this by overhauling the official secrets act which is the only piece of uk legislation that specifically addresses hostile state activity ministers will also consider whether to adopt further powers in line with those in countries such as the united states and australia as well as whether there is a case for updating the historic treason laws in some cases the measures could apply to actions committed outside the uk in order to protect britains overseas assets and deal with hostile actors operating abroad the moves follow the poisoning last year of the former russian spy sergei skripal and his daughter yulia in an attack blamed by the government on the kremlin at the same time the prime minister is to lead what is described as the deepest review of britains security defence and foreign policy since the cold war it will cover the armed forces the intelligence agencies and counter - terrorism as well as the development of britains foreign policy outside the eu it will look at whitehalls thinking on all aspects of deterrence in a rapidly evolving security environment including ways in which technological surprise could threaten security video report by itv news correspondent ben chapman the scottish parliament has passed the referendums scotland bill effectively agreeing that indyref2 should be held if the prime minister allows it it came after nicola sturgeon formally wrote to boris johnson demanding a new referendum on scottish independence the bill which passed by 68 votes to 54 in holyrood thursday evening sets out what the rules for the referendum should be however it is accepted that msps would have to approve more legislation before a vote could be held scotlands first minister published scotlands right to choose a paper that puts forward the clear democratic case for a section 30 order from the uk government she claims democracy will prevail and due to her unarguable mandate but prime minister johnson as he has repeatedly said he would do is expected to reject ms sturgeon 's demand which would transfer the power to holyrood to hold an independence referendum she says her resounding general election win in scotland which brought her 47 of the 59 scottish seats in westminster put scotlands future in scotlands hands she said if mr johnson wants to reject her request he must set out why he does not believe people in scotland have the right to self determination the release of the paper comes as the prime minister is due to set out his agenda with the queens speech on thursday laying out his legislative agenda meanwhile the referendums scotland bill which will lay out parameters for future votes is expected to pass at holyrood on the same day sturgeon urges scottish parliament to unite for a new independence referendum nicola sturgeon warns pm he can not bludgeon scotland into accepting his view speaking at bute house her official residence in edinburgh ms sturgeon said the alternative is a future that we have rejected being imposed upon us scotland made it very clear last week it does not want a tory government led by boris johnson taking us out of the european union that is the future we face if we do not have the opportunity to consider the alternative of independence last weeks election victory was the third in succession for the snp after majorities in scotland in 2015 and 2017 she said the result of last weeks general election makes that mandate unarguable so with the publication of this document we lay out the detailed case for putting scotlands future into scotlands hands ms sturgeon said she would push for a legitimate vote boris johnson reiterates opposition to indyref2 in call with nicola sturgeon independence supporters said in 2014 that another vote should only be held if there is a material change in the relationship between scotland and the rest of the uk such as leaving the eu without a majority in favour in scotland ms sturgeon said there is no doubt whatsoever there has been a material change in circumstances since 2014 today i urge people in scotland to rally round the case for scotlands right to choose our right to self determination it is not the time for scotland to give up on reasoned and democratic argument but to pursue it ever more confidently in recent days leading figures in the scottish labour party have indicated their support for another referendum with the first minister calling for unity on the subject at holyrood on tuesday the queen is to outline the prime minister 's agenda for the upcoming year following the conservatives ' general election win during the state opening of parliament the queen will read out a speech prepared by the government which will have the nhs and brexit at its heart boris johnson said he wanted to use the set piece parliamentary occasion to push an agenda also centered on law and order infrastructure and education the government will enshrine in law a commitment on nhs funding with an extra 33.9 billion per year provided by 2023/24 mr johnson said the queens speech will also include proposed legislation to abolish hospital car parking charges for those in greatest need likely to include disabled people parents of sick children staying overnight and staff working night shifts the nhs funding bill is intended to be the first piece of domestic legislation put on the statute book after the proposed passing of the withdrawal agreement bill which the pm insists will see the uk quit the eu on january 31 restoration of bursaries for student nurses confirmed by boris johnson the pm said the government will also pledge to make it easier for hospitals to manufacture and trial innovative medicines and an independent body would improve patient safety by investigating concerns and incidents raised by patients and families speaking to nhs nurses at a downing street reception on wednesday mr johnson said the nhs is the single greatest institution in this country and its absolutely vital that we as political leaders all kinds and all levels understand what is going on in the nhs but the pressures and demands are enormous and we have to help you cope with that we have to invest and as you may have heard in the last few weeks we are we are upgrading hospitals and building new hospitals we are going to have 50,000 more nurses we retain 19,000 who would otherwise vanish and recruit another 31,000 we have 6,000 more gps and 50 million more gp appointments over the next five years we are now putting the biggest investment in the nhs in living memory we have to keep that investment going downing street said the queens speech will also confirm an additional 1 billion for social care every year of the new parliament the government will also urgently seek a cross - party consensus for long term reform so nobody has to sell their home to pay for care number 10 said the queens speech will commit to increasing levels of funding per pupil in schools and new legislation will see terrorists spend longer behind bars and make it easier for the police to stop and search known knife carriers downing street said pm tells the commons his deal will return on friday so he can get brexit done johnson to legislate to rule out extension of eu ' transition reveals peston brexit legislation will also be prominent with the speech including proposals to implement the uks future relationship with the eu which is due to be agreed by the end of december 2020 the legislative measures will also include proposals to stop vexatious claims against members of the armed forces this queens speech will be more low key than the last one in october with cars used instead of carriages and a hat worn instead of a crown shadow health secretary jonathan ashworth said the re - election of this government passes them the great responsibility of fixing the crisis in the nhs which 10 years of their underfunding has created we will study the legislation they are putting forward but the commitments from their election manifesto fall far short of what is needed to end record waiting times and staff shortages if the conservatives plans to put funding increases into law is to be anything other than an empty gimmick we would urge them to pledge the extra 6 billion a year which experts say is needed to start to make up the cuts they ve imposed for a decade and to put the necessary funding into public health and social care this government will be judged on its handling of the nhs and its ability to put right their disastrous handling of our countrys most important institution over the past decade it 's been almost three decades since the speaker wore a full bottom wig in the house of commons bernard weatherill was the last to follow this centuries old tradition but his successor betty boothroyd decided to go without has has every speak since but when lindsay hoyle was dragged to the post of speaker earlier this year he said he would be making some changes yesterday the clerk of the house was spotted wearing a wig again after they were banned by john bercow in 2017 and speaker hoyle has indicated he 'll also revert to traditional dress but if he was planning on going the full 18th century look with wig there is a slight hitch no one can actually find it it was last spotted 20 years ago when it was offered to michael martin who politely refused harold levy owner of model wigs told itv news suddenly i get a phone call that they might wear it and they ca n't find the last one from nearly 30 years ago which i can understand can we help them we have one in stock if someone wants it they can have it with pleasure three people have even offered to pay for it it 's all down to speaker hoyle the whig party may be long gone here but tomorrow we 'll see if the wigged speaker is back labour leadership hopeful emily thornberry said jeremy corbyn has been weakened by his advisers during his time as leader while she did not mention any of mr corbyn 's advisers by name ms thornberry said there were a number of issues which gave voters the impression that the labour leader was indecisive speaking on the peston show on wednesday the shadow foreign secretary officially confirmed she was in the running for labour 's top job emily thornberry enters labour leadership race as keir starmer seriously considers joining how does a labour leadership election work she said i think there were a number of issues obviously the one the tories have milked for all its worth is jeremy 's reaction to salisbury but most importantly it was the briefing after jeremy made his statement on salisbury which was not on all fours with what jeremy had said and so the briefing to the press thereafter gave a different impression ms thornberry refused to discuss who was behind the briefing after peston suggested media reports had claimed seamus milne mr corbyn 's chief adviser was responsible for the briefing she added but the point is what you need to have in a leadership is to make sure its the leaders who decide and its the advisers who advise and there should not be any mixing up of the two frankly you should have advisers who give advice but the politicians make the decisions and the politicians make those decisions and do not try and go back on it by doing that and it was done too often i think that it weakened jeremy it weakened the impression he gave people and it looked like he was n't certain the shadow foreign secretary was also critical of the labour leadership 's decision to agree to boris johnson 's call for an early general election without being clear with the country on its brexit stance ms thornberry who has advocated for the uk to remain as part of the eu said she tried to express her concerns about going into a general election with mr corbyn prior to the campaign she said it was difficult to get hold of jeremy so i put in black and white what i thought and also sent a letter to the leader 's office and i had a number of conversations with those in the leaders office but in order to make it clear that strategically it was going to be a catastrophic political mistake to go into a leadership election on a single issue when we were not sufficiently clear about that issue when all the other parties were really keen to have it on a single issue because they were hoping to eat the labour vote matt hancock was also on the show the first since the general election campaign and the nhs secretary refused to be drawn on waiting times in the public health service conservatives lgbt+ have apologised after a new mp was incorrectly named as the uk 's first openly gay elected muslim when imran ahmad khan was elected as the conservative mp for wakefield he made news worldwide for allegedly becoming the first openly gay muslim to be elected in the uk but on tuesday the conservative lgbt+ group posted a correction to its website which said we are incorrect to describe him as an out lgbt candidate the website explained that an application was made in his name to the lgbt+ conservatives candidates fund but mr khan informed the organisation that the application had been made in error thornberry enters leadership race as starmer seriously considers it blair corbyn has turned labour into glorified protest movement the statement went on to explain how mr khan fully endorses the group 's aims of protecting the lgbt community but is not an out lgbt mp it added we apologise unreservedly for the incorrect reference to him as such in a tweet mr khan wrote i have seen recent inaccurate press reports saying i am openly gay here 's a release from lgbt conservatives correcting the record he said he would not comment further on the matter when mr khan ousted mary creagh he became the first conservative in decades to take the seat of wakefield away from labour a constituency it had held since 1932 the general election was heralded as bringing in the uk 's most diverse parliament with reports claiming there were at least 45 openly gay mps in the commons following news that the description of mr khan was inaccurate several news outlets deleted their original articles words by itv news westminster producer lewis denison after a crushing defeat in the 2019 general election jeremy corbyn announced he would stand down as leader of the labour party meaning for the next few months candidates will be making their case to replace him the race officially began on tuesday january 7 and the winner will be announced on saturday april 4 it was agreed by the party 's ruling national executive committee nec but what happens in between those dates and how will the next leader be chosen step 1 nominations from colleagues for a labour leadership hopeful to become a candidate on the ballot paper they must first be an mp for the party and be nominated by 10 % of its mps and meps in the 2020 leadership contest hopefuls will have from january 7 till january 13 to get the required 22 signatures if a leadership hopeful is unable to win backing from 10 % of members then their application to be on the ballot will be rejected labour leadership hopefuls criticise manifestos scale in bid to succeed jeremy corbyn step 2 gaining backing from elsewhere once a leadership hopeful has gained support from enough colleagues they must also gain support from local labour parties known as consituency labour parties clps or from affiliates thanks to a rule introduced in 2018 candidates must gain backing from 5 % of clps the threshold would be around 33 clps or from three of its affiliates affiliates include 12 trade unions tied to the labour party and associated groups such as the jewish labour movement controversially however labour party rules state two of three affiliates must be trade unions giving them enormous clout in the selection process it means it would not be possible for a candidate to pass this stage without either the support of local labour parties or trade unions from january 15 until february 14 clps unions and affiliates will be able to nominate who they want to be the next leader step 3 gaining labour voters ' support members of the labour party affiliated supporters and registered supporters are able to vote in the leadership contest as of july 2019 the party had 485,000 members according to parliament.uk affiliated supporters are people who are members of labour 's socialist societies and 12 trade unions around 99,000 people from this category voted in 2016 a registered supporter is someone who pays a fee to be able to vote in the election in 2015 when mr corbyn was first elected the nec set the amount at 3 and more than 100,000 registered when mr corbyn 's leadership was challenged a year later the figure was raised to 25 and the registration was only open for 48 hours but a huge 180,000 still registered to vote the fee for registered supporters remains at 25 for the 2020 leadership election and again they will be given 48 hours to register registered supporters will be allowed to sign up to join the election process from january 14 - 16 on january 20 there will be a freeze on new members ' voting rights meaning anyone opting for full membership after this date wo n't be able to vote in the election the postal ballot will then run from february 21 to april 2 final stage selecting the winner the party uses the alternative vote system of preferential voting that means in the postal ballot voters rank candidates in order of preference and if more than half of voters have the same favoured candidate they are elected if there is no overall winner the candidate who came last is removed and votes are redistributed to voters next preferred candidate repeating the process until a winner is produced the winner of the 2020 leadership contest will be announced on saturday april 4 the system allows for one vote per person and an nec member told itv news political correspondent paul brand it was agreed that there will be extra checks to make sure people do n't register their dogs this time who are the likely contenders and who 's no longer in the race sir keir starmer is favourite in the race to replace mr corbyn he 's up against shadow business secretary rebecca long bailey and lisa nandy ms long bailey is the likely favourite of corbyn supporters due to her links to and support of the outgoing leader shadow foreign secretary emily thornberry jess phillips and clive lewis have all dropped out of the race after failing to secure enough support shadow foreign secretary emily thornberry has confirmed she is running to be the next leader of the labour party hours after shadow brexit secretary sir keir starmer revealed he is seriously considering the fight ms thornberry one of jeremy corbyn 's closest allies made the announcement in an article for the guardian telling readers she is already experienced in debating boris johnson from when he was foreign secretary she said the next leader should be elected for their political nous and strategic vision rather than their position on brexit or where they live in our country in her article she revealed she warned mr corbyn it would be an act of catastrophic political folly to back the doomed election by throwing her hat into the ring she has become the first labour mp to confirm she wants to lead the party but there is speculation surrounding several others blair corbyn has turned labour into glorified protest movement restoration of bursaries for student nurses confirmed by boris johnson she is likely to face fierce competition with shadow cabinet members rebecca long bailey and angela rayner also believed to be considering their chances but those labour big hitters could be surprised by several backbenchers including 2015 contender yvette cooper jess phillips and lisa nandy who may also stand the shadow cabinet members and the backbenchers represent two different directions of travel for the labour party with those close to mr corbyn likely to carry on his message and the others likely to steer the party away from his agenda sir keir contradicted the party 's most successful leader tony blair when he said labour should not oversteer away from mr corbyn 's radical left wing agenda lisa nandy seriously considering labour takeover amid long bailey reports corbyn apologises to remaining labour mps for election loss reports say he claimed mr corbyn was right to make labour an anti - austerity party and insisted the party should not lurch away from that in the wake of this election defeat his intervention came as ex - prime minister blair made a scathing assessment of mr corbyn 's leadership saying he turned it into a glorified protest movement with cult trimmings utterly incapable of being a credible government mr blair said labour had become marooned on fantasy island in the left of politics and she doubts any prospective leader can take it to the mainland in an attempt to distance himself from mr blair sir keir said the party must not go back to some bygone age some commentators have said sir keir is positioning himself to be closely aligned with the corbyn message in a bid to attract swathes of left wing labour members but sir keir who does not want to be thought of as a torchbearer of corbynism said i do n't need anybody else 's name tattooed to my head to make a decision on this sir keir said i fundamentally believe that the move in 2015 by the labour party to a position of anti - austerity anti - cuts to our public services was right what jeremy corbyn brought to the labour party in 2015 was a change in emphasis that was really important a radicalism that matters told the bbc radio 4 today programme we need to build on that rather than simply say let 's now oversteer and go back to some bygone age we need to build on that radicalism what we must n't do is say now because we have lost in 2019 that move to an anti - austerity party has got to be rejected and we go back to some other political place that we were in in the past tony blair has torn into jeremy corbyn 's leadership or lack of it and blamed him and his almost comic indecision over brexit for labour 's crushing defeat in the general election the former labour leader said mr corbyn took his mps into the election with a strategy for defeat and said the result had brought shame on the party he attacked the takeover of the labour party by the far left which he claimed turned it into a glorified protest movement with cult trimmings utterly incapable of being a credible government he warned labour is marooned on fantasy island in the left of politics and said he doubts any prospective leader can take it to the mainland mr blair whose old safe labour seat of sedgefield fell to the tories in the election said the performance by labour at such a crucial time in british politics was unforgivable he warned of 15 years more of tory government if labour could not transform itself into a serious progressive alternative to the conservatives if not he said the party was finished why keir starmer is the labour leadership candidate to beat jeremy corbyn faces criticism from labour mps amid warning from tony blair mr blair said the party was punished for changing from a leave stance following the brexit referendum but claimed the defeat was the result of a corbyn problem and secondarily a brexit problem he urged the party to learn from the election and warned against a whitewash of the devastating defeat he said mr corbyn 's planned process of reflection before standing down as leader will cause irreparable damage if it buries the reasons for the partys worst result since 1935 mr blair who is the only labour leader to have won a general election in the last 45 years criticised the sectarian ultra - left politics that have taken over the party blamed mr corbyn for driving away traditional supporters he added labour needs not just a different driver but a different bus mr blair told the audience in central london that the result marks a moment in history and was no ordinary defeat for labour as the party undergoes a battle to replace mr corbyn and diagnose the causes of the disaster the choice for labour is to renew itself as the serious progressive non - conservative competitor for power in british politics or retreat from such an ambition in which case over time it will be replaced he is expected to add so at one level sure lets have a period of reflection but any attempt to whitewash this defeat pretend it is something other than it is or the consequence of something other than the obvious will cause irreparable damage to our relationship with the electorate corbyn apologises to remaining labour mps for election loss reports say mcdonnell owns labours election disaster a report by mr blair 's foundation based on polling and focus group research identifies five pillars of northern discomfort including brexit that labour suffered in the election which saw dozens of seats in its heartlands including mr blairs former sedgefield seat snatched by the tories it concedes that mr corbyn did not cause labours crisis which has been brewing for some years but criticises his neutral brexit stance perceived associations with extremism and allegations of a lack of patriotism for creating a lethal mix to eject prime minister boris johnson from downing street the report says mr corbyn was tasked with reversing labours decline in the midlands and the north of england instead his leadership and his political strategy achieved precisely the opposite they drove even more traditional labour supporters away from the party the report by the tony blair institute for global change states mr corbyn has sought to defend his manifesto which included the renationalisation of key utilities as being extremely popular and blame brexit for having dominated the debate sturgeon urges scottish parliament to unite for a new independence referendum but the report for mr blairs organisation says the eu was not the main explanation and instead criticises the current leader and the politics he represents only 24 % of voters polled in the report believed mr corbyn is patriotic with focus group participants criticising his perceived associations with the ira and terror groups the fatal london bridge terror attack during the campaign had real cut through the report says with perceptions being that mr corbyns stance was weak his policies were individually popular polling suggested but voters felt they lacked credibility when taken together with 22 % thinking the ideas were both good in principle and that labour could be trusted to spend the money wisely a labour source defended mr corbyn and blamed mr blair for having overseen the start of labours decline in 2017 we saw the biggest swing to labour since 1945 and more people voted for labour under jeremy both in this election and in 2017 than ed miliband in 2015 gordon brown in 2010 or tony blair in 2005 the source said as with scotland the decline in labour support in the north discussed in this report started under tony blair while the party undergoes a period of reflection perhaps tony blair should reflect on his own role boris johnson has confirmed plans to restore bursaries for student nurses after they were scrapped as part of the conservatives austerity measures the return of the payments of up to 8,000-a year was one of the central measures of the tory general election manifesto unveiled last month health secretary matt hancock said the new financing was being offered to encourage new nurses to join the profession as the government aims to stick to its pledge of recruiting 50,000 more into the nhs in england he said if you want a rewarding career in nursing which is an incredibly rewarding profession then you can get going now knowing that that financial support will be there he added it 's about encouraging more people to go into nursing the number of nurses has risen by 5,000 in the last year that 's good but it 's not but its not fast enough and we need more nurses he said that the money was being offered now because the deadline for applications is january 15 however critics pointed that about 19,000 would come through the retention of existing staff rather than new recruits downing street said annual payments of 5,000 would be available to all student nurses as well as some allied health professionals from september next year with a further 3,000 for specialist disciplines such as mental health which are hard to recruit at the same time the government confirmed it was pressing on with its review of the nhs pensions issue which lead some senior doctors to turn down extra shifts because they were being hit by hefty tax bills nhs england has previously announced special arrangements for 2019/20 meaning no doctor in england will be worse off as a result of taking on extra shifts this winter mr johnson said i have heard loud and clear that the priority of the british people is to focus on the nhs and to make sure this treasured institution has everything it needs to deliver world class care there can be no doubting our commitment to the nhs and over the coming months we will bring forward further proposals to transform this great country johnson to enshrine 33bn nhs spending pledge in law manifesto promises on nhs not deliverable top doctor warns royal college of nursing general secretary dame donna kinnair welcomed the grant as a first victory for the campaign that our student nurses are running this announcement will hopefully encourage more people to apply to a nursing degree by the mid - january deadline she added in the run up to the budget we continue to call for our students to not pay tuition fees up front any barriers for people wanting to enter nursing must be removed labours shadow health secretary jonathan ashworth welcomed the tory reversal but called for further funding the conservatives policy of forcing would be nurses to pay tuition fees has demonstrably failed in the last two years he said while it is good to see that they have u turned on their terrible policy position nurses have called for additional funding to cover tuition fees too not just living costs as the tories promised in their manifesto video report by itv news political correspondent romilly weeks jeremy corbyn was heavily criticised by labour mps for his party 's worst general election result since 1935 as the first candidates to replace him as leader begin to emerge in the first meeting between the parliamentary labour party plp since last week 's defeat former mp mary creagh accused the outgoing leader of being a preening narcissist who was responsible for the devastating loss for labour meanwhile rachel reeves mp said there were a lot of excuses given by the leadership at the meeting in the house of commons the leeds west mp also called on the party to face up to the reality of the electoral defeat or face the possibility of never winning again shadow brexit secretary sir keir starmer appeared to throw his hat into the race to replace mr corbyn telling the guardian that he was seriously considering whether to run for labour 's top job boris johnson tells new cabinet you ai n't seen nothing yet who is the re - elected speaker of the house of commons lisa nandy seriously considering labour takeover in the newspaper he said the party needed to return to being a broad church and that labour should have challenged boris johnson 's mantra to get brexit done he added there 's no hiding from it it is a devastating result but it 's important not to oversteer the case for a bold and radical labour government is as strong now as it was last thursday we need to anchor ourselves in that i want trust to be restored in the labour party as a progressive force for good and that means we have to win but there 's no victory without values at a meeting with the parliamentary labour party on tuesday evening mr corbyn reportedly apologised and took responsibility for the defeat but it is understood the labour leader also piled blame onto brexit claiming it was a major reason labour lost voters ' trust as he told mps they must listen to those they have lost mr corbyn is understood to have said the election was ultimately about brexit despite his best efforts to take debate away from the issue and he said it was a major although not the only reason the voters did not back the party it is also reported he instructed the mps to reject mr johnson 's brexit bill because the prime minister has imposed an impossible timetable to get a trade deal with the eu he reportedly told mps he will stay on until a new leader is elected to ensure the smoothest possible transition for the sake of the party as a whole and for those labour mayors and councillors who are up for re - election in may whoever the next leader is he said they will need the party to come together for those elections and to oppose boris johnson 's conservatives mr corbyn claimed a reason he lost the election was because of the prime minister 's ability to persuade voters he could get brexit done that will soon be exposed for the falsehood it is he is understood to have told the meeting former labour mp mary creagh who lost her seat at the general election hit out at jeremy corbyn following the plp meeting she said what they were saying on the doorsteps in wakefield is simply not repeatable before the watershed ms creagh said no senior labour figures had been in touch since last week 's vote adding i 've had no phone calls or messages from anyone in jeremy or his team she described the labour leader as a preening narcissist who still thinks he 's still got something left to offer our labour movement leeds west mp rachel reeves also criticised corbyn following the plp meeting she said there were a lot of excuses from the leadership that people did n't vote that turnout was n't high enough that the tories campaigned too hard in seats that had always been labour that the mainstream media had n't given us a fair run but everyone who knocked on the door during the general election knows the biggest drag on our support was jeremy corbyn she added unless we face up to those realities we are never going to win again looking ahead to a vote on the pm 's brexit deal mr corbyn is understood to have said on friday we have the debate on the withdrawal agreement bill wab he is understood to have told the plp we will vote against it because by putting an impossible timetable for a good deal with the eu boris johnson has already shown that his priority is a toxic deal with donald trump that will sell out our nhs and risk the safety of our food and the wab significantly risks undermining the good friday agreement he added nicola sturgeon has urges a coming together of parties in the scottish parliament in order for them to secure a new independence referendum in her first speech to the scottish parliament since the snp won a huge majority in scotland in the general election ms sturgeon said there was now a democratic deficit between westminster and holyrood that could not be sustained the snp which now holds 80 % of seats in scotland claims it has a huge mandate for a indyref2 and leader sturgeon said she would publish the detailed democratic case this week for powers to be transferred to the scottish parliament in order for another vote to be held the first minister said there is a growing cross - party recognition that election mandates should be honoured that there has been a material change of circumstances and that the question of independence must be decided by the people and not by politicians given the nature of what we are facing in terms of uk governance this is now a matter of some urgency which is why this government wants people to have a choice next year boris johnson tells new cabinet you ai n't seen nothing yet peston why keir starmer is the labour leadership candidate to beat the first minister said there was a similar coming together in scotland before the establishment of the scottish parliament she said back in the early 1990s when scotland was also facing the prospect of a fourth tory government with no mandate here there was a coming together of political parties communities and civic scotland that resulted in the establishment of this parliament it has achieved much a new brexit focused tory government presents risks that few would have predicted at the dawn of devolution so i hope in the coming days and weeks we will see a similar coming together around the idea of scotland 's right to choose a better future who is the re - elected speaker of the house of commons lisa nandy seriously considering labour takeover scottish conservative leader jackson carlaw said what this election has confirmed beyond doubt or debate is that the whole of the united kingdom together will be leaving the european union at the end of next month the campaign to stop it happening has failed our departure is going ahead and the result of the 2016 uk referendum will be respected he added brexit is no longer a what if it is a political reality for us all the whole of the uk together will now enter the period of transition and leave on the basis of the future trading arrangements with our eu partners negotiated next year despite this being the brexit election the largest survey yet on last weeks general election has revealed the uk is as much divided along age and education lines as it is remain versus leave the yougov survey found men are more likely to vote conservative that labour voters are educated to a higher level while those who ticked tory on polling day are more loyal to the party brexit still played a huge role in december 's election of those surveyed 55 % of remainers voted labour while 65 % of leavers gave the conservatives their backing with the tories boosting their vote share among leavers and despite their get brexit done message the conservatives managed to hold onto two thirds of their remain backing voters labour meanwhile lost a chunk of the remain vote to the lib dems their share dropping to just under half 49 % with their stop brexit ' pledge the lib dems managed to increase their vote share among remainers to 21 % up from 12 % in 2017 but not enough to save them from a dismal night at the polls only half 52 % of those who voted to leave in the eu referendum and for labour in 2017 stuck with corbyn 's team in 2019 a third 33 % of these leave voters moved directly to the conservatives 6 % cast their ballot for the brexit party the yougov survey asked 40,000 british citizens across age gender class education and previous votes the research found traditional battle lines such as class were less of a key indicator in how people voted age was found to be more of a determining factor in how people vote with 67 % of over 70s backing the tories while 56 % of those in the 18 - 24 bracket putting their cross next to a labour candidate the research found that for every 10 years older a voter is their chance of voting conservative increases by around nine points while the likelihood of them voting labour decreases by eight points the political tipping point at which a voter leans from left to right has dropped from the age of 47 to 39 there was a fairly even gender split with 46 % of all men questioned voting tory compared to 44 % of women but the gap opens widely in the 18 - 24 age bracket where 65 % of women voted labour compared to 46 % of their male contemporaries class is no longer the voting indicator it once was with the conservatives outperforming labour across all social grades considering the party 's strong performance in former industrial towns along the red wall it should not come as too much of a surprise that the conservatives made gains among c2de working class voters the tories actually got a larger share among those voters 48 % than they did amongst abc1 middle class voters 43 % among the much larger group of voters who do not hold a degree conservatives gained 58 % labour were consistent across both social grade groups 33 % but outperformed conservatives among voters with a degree or higher with 43 % of the share in that group compared to the tories ' 29 % the lib dems also did well with those who had been to university gaining 17 % of the vote crucially the conservatives retained far more of their 2017 voters than labour did with some 85 % of those staying with the tories in the most recent election compared to 72 % of labour voters the snp kept hold of 87 % of their past voters according to the study if you believe betting odds rebecca long bailey is a shoo in to be labour leader after the shadow chancellor john mcdonnell on sunday anointed her as the candidate most likely to build on the corbyn / mcdonnell project but punters may be getting ahead of themselves for one thing i am told that a yougov poll of labour members carried out in the week of the general election delivered the same result as a yougov poll in july namely it showed that keir starmer is more popular among members than any other candidate back then 68 % of labour members said starmer would be a very or fairly good leader and only 12 % said he would be a poor leader i am told that last week 's poll showed that starmer 's popularity among labour members is still of a similar magnitude by contrast just 34 % of them in july said long bailey would be a good leader and 21 % thought her poor so starmer came top both gross and net in each case by a wide margin johnson to legislate to rule out extension of eu ' transition reveals peston the political earthquake in three cs writes robert peston what were the important campaign moments asks robert peston which is presumably why the long bailey campaign is so fast out of the traps and why her supporters are saying that the next leader must have three qualities that starmer lacks namely the leader must represent a northern seat he 's central london must n't be a passionate remainer and must be a woman all of which is to say that appearances to the contrary starmer is the candidate to beat and after the contest starts in january the first big hurdle for them all will be the endorsements of the big unions it is widely assumed that len mccluskey general secretary of the most powerful union unite will throw his union 's considerable weight behind long bailey even though mccluskey and mcdonnell have not seen eye to eye on everything in recent months and there is talk that the gmb will back her too my understanding is that mccluskey will call a unite executive meeting in mid to late january when all the candidates will be invited to pitch however the endorsement of any union is mainly useful in getting a candidate off the nominations list and into the final ballot of members in the end the choice of leader will be made by individuals namely members affiliated supporters and registered supporters so given that ultimately the decision in march about who leads labour will be taken mainly by members it is striking that back in july angela rayner long bailey 's flatmate and pal who looks set to run for deputy leader rather than leader polled better than long bailey as did emily thornberry of the likely candidates only jess phillips polled worse than long bailey because phillips had been a consistent critic of the members then darling jeremy corbyn phillips knows she has a mountain to climb as does the other likely candidate lisa nandy who was n't seen as a credible successor to corbyn till more recently sir lindsay hoyle has been reelected as speaker of the house of commons telling mps his office is open to all the chorley mp was returned to the post unopposed at the start of the new parliament he replaced john bercow as speaker in

is sir lindsay hoyle mps and fans of parliament tv will have a new voice to get used to after sir lindsay hoyle was reelected the new speaker of the house of commons with his lulling lancastrian tones the labour mps appointment will mean a more regional english accent being heard guiding proceedings rather than his predecessor john bercows southern bark his easy on the ear northern twang does not mean sir lindsay is a stranger to tackling the boisterousness of those on the green benches first elected mp for chorley in 1997 he has been mr bercows most senior deputy known by the formal title chairman of ways and means since 2010 when post - expenses scandal reforms saw the role elected by mps rather than appointed by the leader of the commons the bolton wanderers fc fan saw his public profile rise after his handling of a spiky budget speech in 2013 mps were particularly riled that year after the main policy announcements appeared in the london evening standard newspaper before the then chancellor george osborne stood up at the despatch box rebuking one unruly parliamentarian he bellowed the panto season is not for another nine months he also scolded the snp for singing ode to joy the european unions anthem during the vote to trigger article 50 sir lindsay 62 became favourite for the role of commons referee when mr bercow announced he was stepping down after 10 years in the

she is seriously considering a bid for the labour leadership amid reports a familiar face may be elected to carry on the jeremy corbyn project ms nandy one of the few labour red wall mps to be re - elected said the reason her party suffered so badly in the general election was not just because of mr corbyn but the party 's direction of travel in what may have been a veiled swipe at potential leadership hopefuls from the left of labour such as rebecca long bailey ms nandy said we ca n't just change the face and think that everything will be resolved she added in many parts of the country it was n't just about jeremy corbyn i do n't think that the idea that one individual alone is responsible for what has happened here is right the wigan mp who was once mr corbyn 's shadow energy and climate change secretary said she is seriously thinking about whether to throw her hat into the leadership ring but said she intends to do some research first boris johnson tells new cabinet you ai n't seen nothing yet nicky morgan retains cabinet role despite standing down as mp the new mps with eye catching cvs including an ex - dolphin trainer she said she wants to just do a bit of listening before she makes her final decision about what should come next and what role i can play in it another problem with labour she said was the fact much of the party is based in london if i do run to be leader of the labour party i am not going to spend all my time in london she said if i was the leader of the labour party i would be saying to those journalists and those people who make decisions who wield power you need to get on a train and come north we 're going to smash up this concentration of power in a small number of hands in a small part of central london because that is part of the problem her comments come amid reports that ms long bailey is considering running for leader with her flatmate angela rayner reportedly hoping to be her deputy according to multiple reports ashton under lyne mp ms rayner has not made a final decision but is exploring a deputy leadership bid ms long bailey who is the mp for salford is one of several candidates said to be a possible successor to mr corbyn having received the backing of senior figures in the partys current leadership many in the political left believe the best new leader for labour should be a female from the north and rebecca long bailey fits that description but former darlington mp jenny chapman who lost her seat in the election said it is crazy anyone should suggest prerequisites for a new leader she told itv news political correspondent daniel hewitt it wo n't be good enough if we pick someone who makes us feel good so we can say look we 've got a woman we 've got someone from the north ' the labour leadership battle descended into acrimony on sunday after another contender emily thornberry was accused by former mp caroline flint of labelling leave voters stupid following the european referendum result in 2016 shadow foreign secretary ms thornberry accused ms flint who lost her don valley seat in the election of spreading the most extraordinary lies and confirmed she had approached her solicitors over the remarks while ms flint is likely reeling from her election loss senior tory michael gove is happy to have seen her lose her place in parliament looking ahead to a labour leadership contest mr gove said she would be the mp he feared most emily thornberry accuses caroline flint of making up s about her and says she is taking legal action will labour 's next leader be female itv news political correspondent daniel hewitt who was interviewing mr gove jokingly reminded the minister that ms flint had lost her seat that 's the problem for the labour party in a way that many of the people who would be strong leaders of the labour party caroline flint ian austin john woodcock they 're not available that i think is the dilemma and difficulty that the labour party faces video report by itv

return on friday he told mps the new parliament would not waste the time of the nation in deadlock and division and delay as he and mps in unison repeated his favourite slogan we 're going to get brexit done labour leader jeremy corbyn as he spoke following mr johnson congratulating the pm on winning the election and being returned to office earlier on tuesday mr johnson held cabinet for the first time since winning the general election telling members they must work flat out to repay voters for lending their votes to the tories for brexit it comes after a plan was revealed to legislate to block mps from extending the brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020 ministers are understood to have re - worked the withdrawal agreement bill wab due to come before the commons this week to legally prohibit any further extension michael gove the cabinet minister in charge of no deal preparations told itv news the plan to block an extension was made to show the public they are

24 hours a day work flat out to deliver on this boris johnson to legislate to rule out extension of eu ' transition reveals political editor robert peston boris johnson welcomes new mps to westminster and tells them his brexit deal will return this week under current plans the government intends to end britains eu membership on january 31 with an implementation to run to the end of 2020 while it negotiates a free trade agreement with brussels however at present this post - brexit transition period can be extended by mutual agreement for up to two years if more time is needed to reach an agreement the prime minister repeatedly promised during the election campaign that he would not seek any extension to the transition period mr gove told itv news political correspondent daniel hewitt the plan to block further extensions proves to voters they have a government that will commit to taking the uk out of the eu it 's really important i think that after three and a half years when people have felt frustrated that their wishes on brexit had not been honoured when that mandate has not been respected that they have a government that will commit to making sure that the promises in its manifesto on brexit timing are kept after mr johnson was returned to power with an unexpectedly large majority there was speculation he could use his strengthened position to seek an extension if

preparations told itv news the plan to block an extension was made to show the public they are committed to taking the uk swiftly out of the eu he told daniel hewitt it 's really important i think that after three and a half years when people have felt frustrated that their wishes on brexit had not been honoured when that mandate has not been respected that they have a government that will commit to making sure that the promises in its manifesto on brexit timing are kept the move comes as mps gather at westminster for the first sitting of the new parliament on tuesday following last weeks general election ahead of a house of commons showdown between mr johnson jeremy corbyn the prime minister convened a meeting of his new cabinet he told members they must work flat out in order to repay voters for lending votes to the tories for brexit the conservatives return in buoyant mood after mr johnson was swept to an unexpected 80-seat majority as a swathe of labour strongholds fell

under current plans the government intends to end britains eu membership on january 31 with an implementation to run to the end of 2020 while it negotiates a free trade agreement with brussels however at present this post - brexit transition period can be extended by mutual agreement for up to two years if more time is needed to reach an agreement the prime minister repeatedly promised during the election campaign that he would not seek any extension to the transition period the commitment was instrumental in persuading nigel farage not to stand brexit party candidates in conservative held seats however key eu figures including chief negotiator michel barnier have expressed scepticism a deal can be agreed by the end of 2020 raising the fresh prospect of a no deal break unless there is an extension boris johnson welcomes new mps to westminster and tells them his brexit deal will return this week nicky morgan retains cabinet role despite standing down as mp as new wales secretary is appointed a number 10 source said last week the public voted for a government that would get brexit done and move this country forward and that s exactly what we intend to do starting this week our manifesto made clear that we will not extend the implementation period and the new withdrawal agreement bill will legally prohibit the government agreeing to any extension after mr johnson was returned to power with an unexpectedly large majority there was speculation he could use his strengthened position to seek an extension if more time was needed to get a trade deal the latest move would appear to have put paid to that the wab is due to be brought before the commons on friday and could receive its first reading and be voted on at second reading in one day if the speaker agrees the prime ministers official spokesperson said we plan to start the process before christmas and will do so in the proper constitutional way in discussion with the speaker meanwhile boris johnson has been accused of showing two fingers to democracy after announcing nicky morgan will carry on as culture secretary despite her quitting the commons at the general election number 10 said the former mp for loughborough would be made a life peer and would answer questions in the house of lords there were signs that her appointment may only be temporary pending a full scale cabinet reshuffle expected in february but it still drew a furious response from opposition mps with former shadow culture secretary chris bryant saying it stinks you abandon your constituents eschew the tough work of representing a constituency but remain in the cabinet that really is two fingers up to democracy he said the first business of the new house of commons will be the election of the speaker with the return of sir lindsay hoyle expected to be a formality the rest of tuesday and wednesday will be taken up with the swearing in of mps ahead of the state opening and queens speech setting out the governments legislative programme on thursday shadow education secretary angela rayner is to step aside and support her friend rebecca long bailey to succeed labour leader jeremy corbyn according to reports ms rayner is expected to run as deputy leader in a bid that would allow her flatmate shadow business secretary ms long bailey to take the partys top job it comes as mr corbyn indicated he would quit as labour leader in the early part of next year after the party suffered its worst general election defeat since 1935 emily thornberry accuses caroline flint of making up s about her and says she is taking legal action will labour 's next leader be female tom watson stepped down as deputy leader shortly before the election was called according to multiple reports ashton under lyne mp ms rayner has not made a final decision but is exploring a deputy leadership bid ms long bailey who is the mp for salford is one of several candidates said to be a possible successor to mr corbyn having received the backing of senior figures in the partys current leadership the labour leadership battle descended into acrimony on sunday after another contender emily thornberry was accused by former mp caroline flint of labelling leave voters stupid following the european referendum result in 2016 shadow foreign secretary ms thornberry accused ms flint who lost her don valley seat in the election of spreading the most extraordinary lies and confirmed she had approached her solicitors over the remarks ms flint accused ms thornberry of telling a colleague after the 2016 referendum i m glad my constituents are nt as stupid as yours and said the comments were not acceptable the islington south and finsbury mp speaking on sky news on monday said she had asked ms flint to rescind the comment before she started legal action one of my former colleagues came out and said the most extraordinary lies about me ms thornberry who is also considered a candidate in the labour leadership race said i ve contacted her and i ve said to her please withdraw i will give you until the end of the day and she has nt so i ve had to go to solicitors i mean people can slag me off so long as it is true ill take it on the chin labours general secretary jennie formby reportedly wrote to the partys ruling national executive committee recommending the contest starts on january 7 with the view of having a new leader by the end of march those who thought boris johnson would exploit his huge majority to be flexible on the end-2020 deadline for negotiating a trade agreement with the eu will be proved wrong at the end of the week because i understand that the revised withdrawal agreement bill will put into law that the transition arrangements with the eu during which the uk is in effect a non - voting member of the eu must end december 31 next year so the option of extending the transition by two years will be eliminated in uk law truthfully this is mainly symbolism in that a law can always be amended but it shows johnson is intent on honouring the tory manifesto commitment to terminate the transition in just over a year from now boris johnson welcomes new mps to westminster and tells them his brexit deal will return this week nigel farage says he wo n't be far from the action as he urges boris johnson to get brexit done this will be seen as increasing the risk there will be in affect a no deal trade relationship with the eu in 2021 with the uk having to incur painful eu tariff payments because eu negotiators and leaders have warned there may not be time to negotiate a comprehensive free trade agreement by the end of next year but johnson has repeatedly insisted he can pull off of a canada style free trade arrangement in that record breaking time the revised withdrawal agreement bill is expected to have its second reading in the commons on friday thanks to the 80-seat majority johnson won in the election the bill is expected to become law well before the 31 january deadline for the uk to leave the eu in a legal sense and enter the new transition arrangements words by itv news westminster producer lewis denison since taking office boris johnson has relied on cabinet ministers to take the lead on issues handled by their departments the prime minister seems quite happy to allow dominic raab to address the commons on foreign policy points matt hancock on health and priti patel on domestic issues but how many of his top team will be returning after mr johnson 's first major cabinet reshuffle of the year there are reports that up to a third could be on their way out when he makes changes expected next week here 's who currently has a job in government zac goldsmith culture secretary ex tory mp goldsmith retains environment minister role

polled 34,559 votes compared to mr goldsmith 's 26,793 on a turnout of 79 % of the electorate nicky morgan culture secretary nicky morgan also retained her role in cabinet following the election despite no longer being an mp the culture secretary announced she would be standing down at the general election but prime minister johnson made her a conservative life peer in order to keep her in his cabinet after being appointed ms morgan joked that leaving the cabinet is harder than leaving the eu and told her followers she was delighted to continue in her role responding to the re - appointment labour mp chris bryant a former shadow culture secretary tweeted it stinks you abandon your constituents eschew the tough work of representing a constituency but remain in the cabinet that

played a big role for mr johnson so far attending several events on behalf on the government including the world economic forum in davos he 's already set a march 11 date for his first post - brexit

fronts in his role as foreign secretary he 's led the way on foreign issues such as the case of harry dunn and the us woman who allegedly killed him in a car crash but he 's also been involved with other issues more recently including brexit mr raab was one of theresa may 's two resigning brexit secretaries stepping down in protest over her deal with the eu he ran to be tory party leader but was beaten in the race by mr johnson who appointed him as foreign secretary priti patel home secretary hard line conservative priti patel raised some eyebrows when she was appointed as boris johnson 's home secretary she was fired as international development secretary in 2017 by theresa may after holding secret meetings with israeli officials but she was surprisingly brought back into the fray by boris johnson possibly due to her support for brexit commentators claim ms patel could be one of the most senior ministers facing the chop michael gove chancellor of the duchy of lancaster despite a tumultuous relationship with boris johnson michael gove is now effectively his right hand man in government the senior tory is widely believed to have derailed mr johnson 's first attempt at the

account posted a slogan reading get berxit done in one moment they summed up the thrust of their digital campaign while labour on polling day opted for a well crafted and clever campaign focussing on memes that online users would understand the conservatives posted a deliberate spelling mistake and attracted thousands of interactions this mirrored the story of the online election in 2019 labour used similar principles that had put themselves so far ahead online in 2017 while the conservatives transformed their strategy and broke the rules of online campaigning labour created videos with actors warning about the future under a conservative government meanwhile the tories used their actual leader in a viral video mimicking that scene from love actually where andrew lincoln professes his love for his best mates partner keira knightley while labour tried complex methods of targeting people the tories spent thousands of pounds on youtube ads that were broadcast to every youtube user in the uk the campaigns had a lot in common both parties spent on snapchat facebook and google and targeted ads but the tories broke the rules while labour followed the script ex head of electoral commission resigns from firm linked to controversial ads 88 % of conservative ads on facebook ' misleading distracting with social media another key point of the tory campaign was using social media to distract from potentially negative stories labour achieved this through major reveals of policy or documentation in their ground campaign their reveal of the leaked us trade deal documents shifted the conversation to ground where they were more comfortable the tories took a less sophisticated approach when the itv debates were taking place the tory press twitter account changed its name to factcheckuk what issues are dominating the election campaign online social media streams were suddenly filled with shock about the move urging twitter to take action the platform gave the tories a slap on the wrist but the conservatives succeeded in limiting mentions of the actual debate online it was another sign of a campaign that took risks and was happy to take attacks from outraged users online foreign secretary dominic raab said after the incident that no one gives a toss about the social media cut and thrust and maybe he was right but the tories clearly gave a toss about their social media and used it to cover their backs and spread their message who spent the most in the last seven days of the campaign labour and the conservatives were neck and neck in their facebook spending labour spent nearly 434,000 while the tories spent just over 464,000 but throughout the campaign labour far exceeded the conservatives spend on facebook from the 13 november to the 12 december labour spent 861,806 while the tories spent 597,636 in fact the lib dems spent the most in those days with over 870,000 spent on facebook ads a sign that spend does not translate into success in 2017 the tories outspent labour on social media but labour had the more successful online campaign in 2019 labours increased spend was a sign that their organic content was having less pickup and the torys lower spend showed an emphasis on other parts of the online campaign a winning formula every election redefines the orthodoxies about what makes a good campaign and with a relatively new campaigning format like digital that is even more true after the cambridge analytica scandal and the political results of 2016 and 2017 targeted ad campaigns were seen to be the secret to success online but the tory campaign in 2019 has redefined that they won not through especially intelligent localised targeting but through mass broadcast and through creating watchable content that led the headlines and created waves throughout the online space fact checking website fullfact designated 88 % of the claims in conservative ads as being misleading but those online ads and posts helped the tories take their biggest victory since thatcher the question for parties now is who can most accurately predict what the next successful strategy online will be because it is clear from this election that following orthodoxies will not bring you success at the polls jacob rees mogg has refused to confirm whether boris johnson will allow him to continue as commons leader following his general

brexiteer was a big player on the prime minister 's frontbench before the general election but with the conservatives winning a huge majority the need for someone from the right of the party had been questioned ahead of a cabinet reshuffle his inclusion on the frontbench had been seen by many as a way for the prime minister to please the influential eurosceptic european research group of 21 tory mps of which mr rees mogg was previously chairman pm to address new tory mps ahead of vote on brexit deal emily thornberry accuses ex - mp of making up s about her but with mr johnson winning a majority of 80 in the election he no longer needs to win the approval of the erg in order to pass legislation if mr rees mogg was to lose his job in government it would signal a change of tack from

power on inequality and on the climate emergency we have won the arguments and rewritten the terms of political debate he said there is no doubt that our policies are popular from public ownership of

said mr corbyn was one of the most principled honest sincere committed anti - racist politicians but he had been demonised by a smear campaign against him mr mcdonnell who confirmed he will also be standing down when mr corbyn goes added i think we have to have a wider debate here about the role of social media and the media overall and sometimes the nature of our politics i do nt want to live in a society where those sorts of lies and smears and character assassination dominate our politics lets have an honest debate about the issues it is nt about individuals it is about policies and

consulting on whether people who do not pay the 154.50 licence fee for watching television or bbcs iplayer catch up service should be prosecuted it comes after downing street refused to appear on bbc radio 4s today programme due to what they believe is its pro - remain bias last financial year 25.8 million households had tv licences bringing in 3.6 billion to the bbc a review may recommend replacing the existing criminal sanctions for non - payment of the tv licence fee with a civil system of fines what can i watch without paying for a tv licence in the run up to last weeks general election mr johnson said he was looking at abolishing the bbc licence fee altogether he said that while the tories were currently not planning to get rid of all tv licence fees the current system bears reflection the current royal charter which sets out the governance of the bbc runs until december 2027 a bbc spokesman said the government has already commissioned a qc to take an in depth look at this matter and he found that the current system of criminal deterrence and prosecution should be maintained and that it is fair and value for money to licence fee payers the review also found that non - payment cases accounted for a minute fraction only 0.3 % of court time decriminalisation could also mean we have at least 200 million less to spend on programmes and services our audiences love

johnson used a highly symbolic visit on saturday to tony blairs old sedgefield constituency to promise to repay the trust of traditional labour voters who turned for the first time to the conservatives in the election the county durham seat was part of a previously solid red wall of safe labour seats across the north the midlands and north wales which turned blue on thursday night

chancellor who played a prominent role in labours election campaign said i ve done my bit and suggested a big reshuffle of labours front bench team will now take place mr mcdonnell added that while jeremy was the right leader it is time for the party to move on under new leadership jeremy corbyns sons pay tribute to their honest and humble father tony blair 's former constituency sedgefield now trusting conservatives with their future mr mcdonnell added we will all go now the new leader will come in place and appoint a shadow cabinet i wo nt be part of the shadow cabinet i ve done my bit we need to move on at that stage with that new leader he told reporters a senior source close to mr mcdonnell who has been shadow chancellor since 2015 said john will stay in place until a new leader and new frontbench team is in place it comes as mr corbyn has indicated he will quit as labour leader in the early part of next year despite facing calls to quit immediately after his partys poor election showing the election saw labour swept aside by the conservatives in its heartlands in the midlands north wales and north eastern england with jeremy corbyns party securing the fewest number of seats since 1935 some traditional labour constituencies such as darlington in the north of england now have a conservative mp for the first time in decades in the case of bishop auckland for the first time since the seat was created mr mcdonnell who retained the hayes and harlington seat he has held since 1997 in thursdays election added that mr corbyn had been demonised by a smear campaign against him by the media no i did nt back the wrong person because jeremy was the right leader we could have won in 2017 things moved on brexit dominated everything he said asked if mr corbyn was the reason for the partys defeat he added i think there is an issue to be discussed about how the use of the social media but also the overall media has turned someone who i think is one of the most principled honest sincere committed anti - racist politicians demonised by a smear campaign against him responding to a disastrous night for labour mr corbyn said he would not be leading the party into another general election speaking about the timetable for him to leave mr corbyn said the national executive will have to meet of course in the very near future and it is up to them it will be in the early

keir starmer jess phillips and emily thornberry mr mcdonnell named labours shadow business secretary rebecca long bailey shadow education secretary angela rayner and shadow justice secretary richard burgon as part of a new generation who could be expected to take leading positions he also added that brexit was not the only reason for labours significant defeat i think we will be in a position learning lessons listening to people constructing a broad coalition right across the country in those seats we have lost it is about listening to people i think it was nt just brexit i think a long history of maybe 40 years of neglect and them saying to politicians you never listen to us and you have allowed our community to run down in this way i am hoping that will enable us to construct a programme to address those issues but it has got to be from the grassroots and community upwards he said boris johnson can not bludgeon scotland into seeing the world in the same way that he does nicola sturgeon has said she spoke with the prime minister in a phone call on friday following the election in which the conservatives swept to a large commons majority while the snp won 48 of the 59 scottish seats downing street said that in the call mr johnson made clear how he remained opposed to a second independence referendum however speaking at the v&a museum in dundee on saturday as she joined her partys newly elected mps ms sturgeon insisted it is unsustainable for the tories to keep saying no to a fresh vote nicola sturgeon election result ' watershed moment for scotland we are not the masters we are servants ' promises boris johnson on visit to north of her phone call with the pm she added i was nt sure how much he d had a chance to catch up with the scottish results i pointed out to him politely of course after i congratulated him that the scottish tories having fought the election on the single issue of opposition to an independence referendum had lost lost vote share lost more than half of their seats it was a watershed election on thursday and its very clear that scotland wants a different future to the one chosen by much of the rest of the uk scotland showed its opposition to boris johnson and the tories said no again to brexit and made very clear that we want the future of scotland whatever that turns out to be to be decided by people who live here you ca nt bludgeon a nation into accepting your view of the world when it is made very clear that it does nt have that view of the world it could nt really be any clearer from the results of this election that scotland does nt want a boris johnson government it does nt want to leave the european union and it wants to be able to determine its own future whatever that future turns out to be ms sturgeon said the united kingdom will only continue to exist by consent this idea that the tories can just say no and sort of imprison scotland in a union against its will i just do nt think will hold said the first minister the union can only continue to exist by consent if the scottish people want it to and you have to be prepared to allow the scottish people to choose if you want to make the argument that it should be part of the union so if boris johnson has confidence in the case for the union and the uk and for scotland staying part of that he should have the guts to make that case and let people decide because he wo nt get away with just saying no and trying to bludgeon the nation of scotland into seeing the world as he does which most of us do nt ms sturgeon added there is no doubt that the prospect of a boris johnson government for the next five years is worrying for people its a grim reality and in my view it makes that case for scotland being able to choose something different all the more urgent and all the more important following a dismal night for the labour party in the election ms sturgeon added i think labour have got some deep soul searching to do before anybody knows the direction they re going to take that s certainly true in scotland but its been true in scotland for a long time i do nt know where labour in scotland goes from here but labour uk wide have got some big questions to answer about their own direction before i think people like me can begin to work out how we might potentially work with them or not in the future video report by

their cross down next to the conservatives he promised voters that his government would be servants not masters of the people who put them in power and i want the people of the north east to know that we in the conservative party and i will repay your trust and everything that we do everything that i do as your prime minister will be devoted to repaying that trust he said and first of all what are we going to do we 're going to get brexit done let the healing begin boris johnson says it 's time for country to find brexit closure boris johnson reiterates opposition to indyref2 in call with nicola sturgeon he said there was much more than just brexit including improving our fantastic national health service mr johnson saw a surge in support among the former labour heartlands much of it apparently driven by frustration with the delay to deliver on the brexit referendum the prime minister made reference on the steps of downing street to the fact he was conscious many people had loaned him their vote and on saturday he was again at pains to point out that he recognised he needed to repay that faith we not the masters we are the servants now and our job is to serve the people of this country and to deliver on our priorities and our priorities and their priorities are the same he said mr johnson said the government would be committed to spreading opportunity across the country we

pressures on him it will be tempting for him to pursue the easy option of a soft brexit the former ukip leader who did not stand at the general election added that he thought his work had been completed in june 2016 when 51.8 % of voters opted to leave he said having endured three elections in the last 30 months let us hope the country can look forward to a prolonged period of political stability and certainty whatever happens over the coming months i will make sure i am not too far away from the action the fact is that if brexit does not get done as johnson has promised repeatedly over the last six weeks pressure will have to be reapplied boris johnson will travel to the north of england on saturday after securing his party 's biggest election win since the 1987 the prime minister secured an 80-seat majority with many of his gains coming in traditional labour heartlands in the north and the midlands some areas such as bishop auckland in the north east had never elected a tory mp before thursday other seats like bolsover sedgefield and great grimsby had been held by labour for decades mr johnson will now meet with newly elected conservative mps as part of a celebratory victory lap let the healing begin boris johnson says it 's time for country to find brexit closure boris johnson reiterates opposition to indyref2 in call with nicola sturgeon what will the first weeks of a boris johnson majority government look like speaking outside number 10 he said he would work round the clock to repay the trust of those who voted for us for the first time including those whose pencils may have wavered over the ballot and who heard the voices of their parents and their grandparents whispering anxiously in their ears mr johnson will make the first move to show newly elected mps that the concerns of their constituents will be heard with a visit on saturday to some of those who overturned a labour majority he told members at an early morning rally in westminster that in order to retain their newfound support the party would have to change some of its priorities in a victory speech on friday the pm emphasised that he had an overwhelming mandate to take britain out of the eu by the end of january and deliver on his pledge to get brexit done mr johnson called for unity in the country urging everyone to find closure and to let the healing begin after more than three years of division but he also recognised that there were concerns away from brexit and in a possible nod towards labour voter concerns confirmed he would prioritise the nhs i believe in fact i know because i heard it loud and clear from every corner of the country that the overwhelming priority of the british people now is that we should focus above all on the nhs that beautiful idea that represents the best of our country he said setting out his first plans for government the pm is expected to reintroduce his brexit deal in the commons next week following the queens speech and state opening of parliament on thursday he has already started work on picking up relations with key european leaders speaking by phone with german chancellor angela merkel and irish taoiseach leo varadkar in an interview on sky news mr varadkar suggested mr johnson could be prepared to strike a trade deal with the european union that would keep the uk closely tied to brussels standards the taoiseach said he wanted to ensure there is a set of minimum standards so that nobody feels that there s unfair competition or anyones trying to undercut them on workers rights and environmental protections in my conversations with mr johnson i think he s probably in a similar space so its a case of now getting on with it he said with all 650 results declared the conservatives had 365 seats after the election a net gain of 67 compared to the state of the parties at the dissolution of parliament in november labour were on 203 a net loss of 42 the snp on 48 a gain of 13 and the liberal democrats on 11 a loss of 10 the result plunged labour into turmoil with leader jeremy corbyn announcing he would not take the party into the next general election after seeing a string of former strongholds fall to the tories but he faced furious demands to quit immediately after he said he intended to lead the party through a process of reflection as it considered the way forward positioning in the race to replace mr corbyn has already started with ardent remainer david lammy confirming he was considering putting his name forward others being touted to take over include lisa nandy who represents leave voting wigan rebecca long bailey angela rayner sir keir starmer jess phillips and emily thornberry the outcome also put mr johnson on a collision course with snp leader nicola sturgeon after she used the landslide result north of the border to demand the right to hold a fresh referendum on scottish independence the pm spoke to ms sturgeon on friday evening reiterating his unwavering commitment to strengthening the union according to a downing street spokesman not long ago tony blair told us a new dawn had broken in british politics over his former constituency this morning quite a different dawn was breaking again after 84 years of labour control sedgefield voted conservative it was one of the shock results of the night but in the old mining villages of durham it was no surprise at all trimdon labour club is now a carpet shop its manager has no doubt about why this area went blue corbyn said paula brown nobody believes in him this is a mining village everybody 's abandoned labour because of corbyn this used to be the place of predictable celebrations now in unpredictable times tony blair 's former agent john burton is saddened by the result he said tony will be the same i 'm very sad really i 'm sad for the people of the area because if they think they 're going to be better off under boris and the tories they 're going to be sadly mistaken with europe as well most of the people wanted to leave and of course we could cope with that but we could n't cope with that and jeremy corbyn who is absolutely toxic the collieries may have been shut for decades but their closure in sedgefield have cast a long shadow over the area 's politics they helped cement labour 's impenetrable red wall ten years ago if i 'd have told anyone living here that they would have a conservative mp today they would have laughed in my face but in old mining areas like this new political lines have now been drawn labour 's traditional supporters did n't believe that their party cared about them anymore at labour 's height tony blair brought george w bush for lunch here back at the pub today generations of labour voters mulled over their decision wherever you look there are reminders of the area 's industrious past voting conservative did n't come easy for some here but they 're now trusting the party with their future as jeremy corbyn signals he could quit as labour leader in the early part of next year after a bruising general election defeat here is a look at how any upcoming leadership contest could play out how is a leadership contest triggered mr corbyn has said it is for the partys ruling national executive committee nec to set the timetable for a leadership contest expected to be some time in early 2020 the labour party rule book states that if the party leader is no longer available the deputy leader automatically becomes leader on a temporary basis the nec would then decide whether to hold an immediate postal ballot for a new leader or to wait until the next party conference but as deputy leader tom watson stepped down shortly before the election was called and so both leader and deputy are unavailable the nec then conducts a postal ballot of labour membership to select a new leader in the interim period the nec may appoint a temporary leader will labour 's next leader be female how can someone be nominated a candidate needs the support of 10 % of mps and meps and in a rule introduced in 2018 candidates also need nominations from at least 5 % of labours constituency parties or from at least three affiliates which represent a minimum of 5 % of the affiliated membership two of the affiliates must be trade unions affiliate groups are organisations such as trade unions or socialist societies who can vote members of the labour party affiliated trade unions and registered supporters are able to vote in a leadership contest the party has used a one person one vote system since 2015 in the postal ballot voters rank candidates in order of preference and if more than half of voters have the same favoured candidate they are elected if there is no overall winner the candidate who came last is removed and votes are redistributed to the voters next preference repeating the process until a winner is produced who are the runners and riders shadow chancellor john mcdonnell played a prominent role throughout the general election campaign but appeared to rule himself out as future leader on thursday night emily thornberry shadow foreign secretary has deputised for mr corbyn at prime ministers questions and is perceived as one of the front runners should an election contest be called sir keir starmer is another member of the shadow cabinet tipped to replace mr corbyn alongside shadow education secretary angela rayner and shadow business secretary rebecca long bailey video report by itv news digital producer natalia jorquera think election season is over think again season two has n't even started after jeremy corbyn 's labour party suffered crushing losses at the ballot box the leader has said he will stand down although it wo n't be right away despite calls from some it could make way for the party 's first female leader so who are the candidates and what are there views jess phillips you might recognise jess from her fiery commons debates the mp for birmingham yardley is n't afraid to speak her mind whilst standing up for her constituents phillips has already hinted at throwing her hat into the leadership ring as soon as friday morning she said on camera she 'd be willing to do so whilst her media prominence social media following and support from labour centrists may be big ticks she lacks support from the very left of the party and that could pose a problem angela rayner shadow education secretary angela rayner has been a loyal supporter of jeremy corbyn after leaving school at 16 with no qualifications she was told she would never amount to anything but she defied that to become the first woman in 180-year history of her ashton under lyne constituency lisa nandy even from her victory speech at the general election the wigan mp appears to have her eyes on the leadership prize she has been labelled a soft left labour mp but could be a compromise for many emily thornberry passionate pro - remain candidate thornberry is best known as the party 's shadow foreign secretary it was previously reported that unite general secretary len mccluskey would back her in a leadership race rebecca long bailey the shadow business secretary and salford mp is a former post woman and a socialist but if corbynism is failed for labour 's failure then she may fail to get backing as someone who stood by him through his campaign yvette cooper a new labour veteran who served in gordon brown 's cabinet she came third in the leadership election which saw corbyn take control of the party she attempted to oust him in 2016 but failed could now be her time boris johnson returned the biggest conservative majority since 1987 at the general election the prime minister has already started the work of governing in the hours after confirming his thumping victory having secured an 80-seat majority he spoke with nicola sturgeon leader of the resurgent snp to reiterate his opposition to a second independence referendum in scotland afterwards he took calls from german chancellor angela merkel and irish prime minister leo varadkar to discuss the next steps on brexit here is what else could be planned for the early tenure of a majority government under mr johnsons leadership december 14 the pm is expected to travel to meet newly elected tory mps the tories dismantled labours so called red wall of seats in the north and midlands thanks to huge swings and the brexit party eating into labour majorities let the healing begin pm says it 's time for brexit closure areas that had not elected a tory mp for decades if ever the likes of bishop auckland in the north east bolsover in derbyshire and blackpool south in lancashire went blue as leave voting areas switched their allegiance away from labour december 16 the former london mayor is expected to announce a new look team next week and his re - shuffle could start as soon as monday there will be impressive election campaign performers who he will be looking to promote and others who bungled and may be demoted as a result commons leader jacob rees mogg who sparked controversy with his insensitive comments about the grenfell tower fire at the start of the campaign could be in the latter camp corbyn denies being to blame for defeat insisting brexit took over the likes of michael gove currently chancellor of the duchy of lancaster and chief secretary to the treasury rishi sunak are touted for bigger roles december 17 mps will return to westminster and begin the process of swearing in where they take an oath of allegiance the process usually lasts a few days but will be rushed through in two in order to allow for a queens speech before christmas december 19 the queen will formally open parliament on thursday but with reduced ceremonial elements

present for voters this could mean mps sitting on friday in order for the bill to be introduced at first reading january 2020 assuming parliament rises for its usual christmas recess mps would be back in westminster in early january to pass the brexit bill they would have just a few weeks to get the legislation through both houses before the january 31 deadline february and beyond mr johnson has made much of getting brexit done so the countrys priorities of health education and infrastructure can be given attention now he no longer has concerns over passing bills through parliament thanks to his 80-seat majority fresh legislation to pave the way for his domestic agenda is expected in a speech outside number 10 on friday he told voters i want to thank you for the trust you have placed in us and in me and we will work round the clock to repay your trust and deliver on your priorities a further reshuffle is also rumoured as he gears up for trade talks with the european union with the intention of signing off a free trade deal in only 11 months video report by itv news scotland correspondent peter smith boris johnson has reiterated his opposition to a second vote on scottish independence during a call with nicola sturgeon despite her saying it is now a democratic right the first minister confirmed she will formally request the powers for holyrood to hold a ballot after the snps victory in scotland in a watershed general election ms sturgeon said the scottish government would publish the detailed democratic case for a transfer of power to enable a referendum to be put beyond legal challenge however during the call on friday the prime minister continued to play down such a move and said the result of the original vote five years ago should be respected nicola sturgeon election result ' watershed moment for scotland a downing street spokesman said the prime minister spoke to first minister of scotland nicola sturgeon earlier this evening where he reiterated his unwavering commitment to strengthening the union on brexit the prime minister said that he is now in a position to get this done in a way that allows the whole of the uk to move forward together providing certainty for scottish businesses and improving the lives of people right across scotland the prime minister made clear how he remained opposed to a second independence referendum standing with the majority of people in scotland who do not want to return to division and uncertainty he added how the result of the 2014 referendum was decisive and should be respected in a prompt response on social media ms sturgeon tweeted and i made clear that @thesnp mandate to give people a choice must be respected just as he expects his mandate to be respected a spokeswoman for the fm added this was a constructive call in which the fm indicated she would be publishing a paper next week and the two leaders agreed to have a more detailed discussion in the near future over the issues raised by the election result the snp increased its tally of mps to 48 as the conservatives lost more than half the seats they had held north of the border earlier on friday ms sturgeon said scotland had chosen a different future than the rest of the uk adding the stunning result renews reinforces and strengthens the mandate for a fresh vote on independence mr johnson has previously stated he is not prepared to grant a section 30 order which would transfer the power to holyrood to hold a referendum speaking at a press conference in edinburgh the snp leader said this is not about asking boris johnson or any other westminster politician for permission it is an assertion of the democratic right of the people of scotland to determine their own future the conservatives were left with six mps in scotland after having won 13 seats two years previously in what ms sturgeon called a crushing defeat in scotland the first minister also said it is clear that the kind of future desired by the majority in scotland is different to that chosen by the rest of the uk scotland has rejected boris johnson and the tories and yet again we have said no to brexit ms sturgeons snp won 45 % of the vote in scotland a slightly higher amount than the 43.6 % of the vote mr johnsons tories secured across the uk pamela nash chief executive of the pro - uk campaign group scotland in union said this election result is

erupt video report and words by itv news correspondent ben chapman can i have my usual please its a question mehmet behind his caf counter hears a lot when it comes to their full english people know what they like and what they do nt for generations politics in ashfield was much the same story preferences were rituals this was a brick in labours red wall sitting at the heart of the old nottinghamshire coalfield it had never before returned a conservative at a general election last night voters broke the habit of a lifetime welcome to the conversation will keighley hold the key to determining election i could nt vote for labour this time because of jeremy corbyn dan tells me over his fry up i just ca nt relate to him at all sitting opposite him is his wife jode both come from what they call labour households both followed the family tradition in their first few elections but attitudes have altered and loyalties have loosened peoples feelings have changed over the years with how labour have handled things says jode the partys not what i remember from being a child and growing up with it as the pits closed warehouses opened jobs are less secure no longer for life and do nt carry a union banner young people are different now one older diner tells me they care more about themselves as individuals scottish left with more than brexit on their minds welcome to the conversation hastings and rye perhaps it explains the willingness to switch directly from labour to the conservatives but there is a b word that comes up even more than brexit boris i m told many people here did nt vote for the conservatives in this election they voted for boris that personal popularity now brings high expectations and a sense the tories owe their victory to places like this its only up north that s saved boriss skin says john who backed an independent candidate i hope that he remembers that when he starts to put all his things into practice welcome to the conversation the west cumbrian village forgotten by parties boris johnsons success in seats like ashfield did nt come as a surprise last night either to those living here or to me having spent the last five weeks talking to voters in places like whitehaven telford and peterborough but their support has been given reluctantly despite nine years of austerity they want to get brexit done and they did nt like the alternatives whether the prime minister can change peoples political tastes more permanently will depend on his ability to deliver the change they crave beyond brexit there were numerous political casualties when the general election results came in including all tories who had the whip withdrawn and remainer defectors some moved parties others stood as independent candidates and three stood under the banner of a new party whatever was written next to their name on the ballot sheet it did not earn them enough votes to return to parliament dominic grieve the former tory is a firm remainer and is most recognised for powerful speeches in the house of commons as mps debated over the future of brexit grieve who was instrumental in having brexit related bills voted down and previously worked at the attorney general under david cameron the lawyer had represented the constituency of beaconsfield since 1997 earning 36,559 votes in the 2017 general election after being stripped of the whip by boris johnson grieve decided to stand as an independent performing well with 16,765 votes but it was 20,000 short of the conservative who replaced him david gauke another who lost the whip and stood as an independent after losing the tory whip for his pro - european views gauke convinced 15,919 to vote for him in hertfordshire south west half of the winning conservative candidate chuka umunna since being touted as a future labour leader umunna has gone on to be a member of two other parties change uk and the lib dems representing the latter in cities of london and westminster seen as a strong remain constituency having moved from his previous streatham seat the change of scenery did not work for umunna who fell 4,000 short of victory as the tories claimed the seat the political earthquake in three cs according to peston nicola sturgeon election result ' watershed moment for scotland luciana berger hugh grant campaigned for the lib dem candidate who left labour to be one of the co - founders of the independent group but like umunna quickly moved on her celebrity endorsement was not enough to turn the tide in finchley and golders green where 17,600 was not enough to oust the conservatives markets bounce on johnson victory is the optimism justified corbyn denies being to blame for defeat insisting brexit took over anna soubry broxtowe did not decide to back their incumbent mp as soubry collected just over 4,500 votes to make matters worse she came 15,000 votes behind the labour candidate watch alan johnson 's fierce attack on corbyn and momentum the fall of farage what next for nigel sam gyimah the former conservative received plenty of vitriol in kensington where he was seen to split the vote allowing the tories to win the seat that is home to grenfell gyimah won 9,312 of the vote standing as a lib dem putting him third behind labour who lost out on the seat by a mere 150 votes gyimah who previously stood for the tory leadership had the whip removed by boris johnson for his remain views antoinette sandbach frank field gavin shuker chris leslie mike gapes angela smith sarah wollaston phillip lee also lost their seats jo swinson ' proud to lead party as she hints at future lib dem leader video report by itv news political correspondent rachel younger former lib dem leader jo swinson has said she is proud the liberal democrats were the unapologetic voice of remain in the election and does not regret trying everything to avoid brexit the now unseated mp said in a speech in central london that smashing the glass ceiling by becoming the party 's first female leader had meant a lot of broken glass comes down on your head she has been forced to quit her role at the head of the party after losing her place in the commons due to liberal democrat rules which dictate its leader must be an mp the party will now look for a new person to steer it a position at which ms swinson hinted there could be some already in stead to take the reigns we smashed the roadblock johnson hails tory victory the political earthquake in three cs according to peston she alluded to the experience of current lib dem spokeswomen including layla moran christine jardine wera hobhouse and sarah olney as women who could lead the party she added they will take the commons by storm jo swinson joined the liberal democrats as a teenager in scotland she went on to represent the constituency she grew up in east dunbartonshire in the house of commons she led the party into the general election with a pro - remain message but it was n't enough to secure a strong backing reflecting on her party 's performance ms swinson said though i wo n't be your leader i will be walking alongside you we will reflect regroup and refresh we must continue to grow our liberal movement both attracting lib dem members and by reaching out to work with those who share our values wherever they are corbyn denies being to blame for defeat insisting brexit took over jo swinson is n't the only party leader backed into a corner over dismal election results labour leader jeremy corbyn has announced he too will stand down over the party 's performance at the ballot box which saw it secure just 203 seats well under the tory majority of 364 in his first major interview since he saw a humbling night for his candidates mr corbyn said he was very sad about the result but warned many areas in the country would continue to suffer under the conservatives he may have thrown his support behind nigel farage and the brexit party who failed to win a single seat at the general election but wetherspoons boss tim martin was 44 million richer on friday with the stock market soaring following the result shares in wetherspoons jumped nearly 10 % by lunchtime on friday meaning mr martins 32 % stake is now worth 531 million on thursday night it was worth 487 million meaning on paper at least the outspoken brexiteer saw his fortune jump by 44 million a wetherspoons share is now worth 1,619p up from 1,482p markets bounce on johnson victory is the optimism justified mr martin has been one of the few business leaders to speak in support of brexit putting him at odds with the majority of other companies who continue to warn that the new government must provide clarity on the future relationship with the eu using his wetherspoons magazine to put forward his case for brexit the pub group also spent 94,856 on brexit beer mats and other publications the boss also vowed to remove eu drinks from menus although favourite tipples including guinness from ireland and prosecco from italy are expected to stay we smashed the roadblock johnson hails tory victory earlier this week wetherspoons also announced plans to invest more than 200 million in pubs and hotels over the next four years creating around 10,000 jobs new pubs and hotels will be opened and existing pubs across the uk and republic of ireland will be enlarged most of the investment will be channelled into developments in small and medium sized towns but will also include larger towns and cities who will be the next lib dem leader after jo swinson loses her seat this was an election as important and as divisive for the uk as margaret thatchers victory in 1979 vast numbers of british people will never be reconciled to boris johnson as prime minister or to brexit in fact a whole nation scotland is already asking permission to leave my assumption however is that johnson will go red tory rather than born again thatcherite because he will want to capitalise on the disaffection from labour of vast numbers of its traditional supporters in the midlands and north of england here are the key moments from the 2019 general election so labour will have its work cut out to look like a party of government any time soon even if it finds a more unifying leader than jeremy corbyn but there is too much to say about consequences of what has happened so for now i want to say a bit more about the why rather than the where next there are three things that stand out for me about the earthquake and they all begin with c the first is c for coalition the conservative party became the coalition of brexit supporters with nigel farage in a perverse way helping johnson by increasing the salience of getting brexit done in that slightly dishonest phrase every time farage opened his mouth but not really providing an alternative version of brexit that many people understood or wanted to back with their votes by contrast it is jaw dropping how utterly useless those who oppose brexit were in putting to one side their tribal loyalties to vote tactically and prevent johnson winning nicola sturgeon election result ' watershed moment for scotland the passionate opposition to johnsons brexit of labour the libdems the snp and plaid cymru was completely overshadowed by their visceral instincts to crush each other in our first past the post electoral system what we witnessed yesterday was collective irrationality by the parties of the centre and left on a breathtaking scale which brings me to the second c for cummings as in dominic cummings johnson chief aide from the moment boris johnson appointed him as consiglieri last july as johnsons first and most significant appointment as pm cummings knew he could get brexit done cursed phrase again by unifying the tory party of which he was not a member to deliver brexit while capitalising on the disunity of the remainers the purging of remainer tory mps and ministers was not accidental but ruthlessly calculated corbyn denies being to blame for defeat insisting brexit took over but what matters more about cummings is the way that he changed the government from well a government into a campaigning machine everything that he and johnson have done since july was explicitly about creating a narrative perhaps a powerful myth that mps and judges and other members of a london based establishment were frustrating the revealed will of the people to leave the eu everything became trumpian slogans the surrender act and ghastly get brexit done being the two most important politics has been simplified and some would say coarsened there was no space for nuanced debate this matters and will have consequences finally there is c for corbyn of course he is right that much of the media especially the press were unfair to him but they were even more vicious about him in 2017 when he led the greatest surge in labours share of the vote since 1945 the point is that back in 2017 his opponent theresa may turned out to be emotionally and psychologically incapable of doing the national campaigning thing this time he faced a much more accomplished opponent in johnson and many of labours traditional white supporters especially in the old mining areas could not suppress their fears that he did not believe in them or in britain we smashed the roadblock johnson hails tory victory these are not my words and views but those of countless numbers of his parliamentary candidates some of whom are today ex - mps traditional white labour voters in the old industrial heartlands rejected corbyn in the way that traditional white democrat supporters rejected hilary clinton in 2016 labour wo nt begin any kind of effective fight back unless it finds a leader those estranged supporters can trust or to put it another way brexit merely exposed the gap between corbyns labour and too many british people brexit was the symptom of labours malaise not the underlying cause video report by itv news political correspondent libby wiener jeremy corbyn has denied he was at the heart of labour 's crushing election defeat in his first major interview since he saw a humbling night for his candidates he said he was very sad about the result but warned many areas in the country would continue to suffer under the conservatives the labour leader said the election was taken over by brexit and that many had voted for brexit again through conservative candidates when asked whether he was part of the problem mr corbyn said he had done everything i could to lead this party but he had received more personal abuse by many areas of the media he said his radical and progressive manifesto was one to be proud of mr corbyn has already said he will not lead the party into another election and has indicated he will quit as labour leader in the early part of next year we smashed the roadblock boris johnson hails stunning election victory nicola sturgeon election result ' watershed moment for scotland when asked what went wrong mr corbyn said those in leave areas in some numbers voted for brexit or conservative candidates which means we lost a number of seats and we did n't make the gains i hoped we could have done particularly in the midlands and yorkshire and the north he added of course i take responsibility for putting the manifesto forward but i have to say the manifesto was universally supported throughout our party and throughout our movement he was asked whether the election spelled the end of corbynism and corbynomics it 's not corbynism there 's no such thing as corbynism there is socialism there is social justice there are radical manifestos he said the issue that dominated this election ultimately was brexit he said the prime minister said he was going to get brexit sorted it was a mirage of nonsense i did everything i possibly could to win this election and to bridge this divide between those who voted leave and those who voted remain he said on the influence of momentum the grassroots support network that was instrumental in seeing corbyn take over the leadership he said they were a group of activists who were committed to growing community action and were a healthy addition to the party some such as former labour minister alan johnson have called for momentum to be kicked out of the party but mr corbyn said a great number of candidates would be great for the support they received from momentum activists he again insisted he was subjected to the most abuse and personal attacks of any leader in the mainstream media if you analyse the coverage that 's made of the labour party if you analyse the coverage that 's made of me you 're looking at in the 80 % and above of negative hostile and frankly downright abuse of individuals and character assassination and constant attacks on me and my family and others i did everything i possibly could to win this election and to bridge this divide between those who voted leave and those who voted remain he said i hope the history books will say that he 's somebody who did campaign to remain he said when asked about his timetable to leave as leader mr corbyn said the national executive will have to meet of course in the very near future and it is up to them it will be in the early part of next year union heavyweight len mccluskey however said after a defeat of this scale there would be a period of reflection and no doubt recrimination mr mccluskey general secretary of unison said the nec would be meeting in the new year and a schedule to launch the hunt for the next leader would begin labour has been trounced the partys plans for nationalisation are dead the financial transaction tax is gone large companies will not have to gift shares to their workforce businesses and high earners will not have to pay higher taxes boris johnson has a resounding mandate to lead and a majority that enables him to be bold should he choose to be the pound rose three cents against the dollar within minutes of the exit poll being published the ftse 250 hit another record high on friday morning as investors bought up shares in house builders banks airlines and other companies whose fortunes are closely tied to the performance of the uk economy is the optimism justified much depends on the ability of johnson to deliver on the promises he has made brexit is not yet done and still wo nt be done when the uk leaves the european union in january joel hills explains the immediate market bounce we smashed the roadblock johnson hails tory victory watch alan johnson 's fierce attack on corbyn and momentum johnson has pledged to negotiate ratify and implement an ambitious and deep and comprehensive trade deal with the eu our largest trading partner he has made a manifesto commitment to do so before the end of 2020 when the transition period expires the negotiations will be tough the eu has indicated a willingness to offer tariff and quota free access but in return it will want the uk to make binding commitments on workers rights state aid and environmental standards it will demand access to uk coastal waters supporters of brexit may find these things hard to stomach they might feel that if johnson were to agree that he would be signing up to precisely the sorts of restrictions they are keen to throw off by agreeing to march in step with the eus rules and regulations johnson would also be potentially locking himself out of trade deals he wishes to strike elsewhere in the world watch itv news ' live election coverage the size of johnsons majority should mean he 'll find that parliament falls into line but attitudes across the channel are likely to harden with all hope of the uk remaining now extinguished the eu will no longer feel the need to tread carefully the timeline to secure a trade agreement is tight and remember every member state has a vote and therefore a veto in a years time the uk may be on the verge of signing a trade deal with the eu that looks anything but deep and comprehensive and we may face the prospect of no deal at all the former would hardly enhance our future prosperity the latter would greatly damage it the markets are unlikely to

us so badly under the european union it was very very hard for them to do business with us the president said on friday afternoon video report by itv news europe editor james mates without nigel farage you could argue we would n't have had this election his impact was felt in every constituency in the land and yet he 's been left perhaps the biggest loser on the night after all it was his brexit dream that was snatched from him he led a revolt against the mainstream for 25 years but ended up trampled by the masses choosing other parties at the polling stations it all begs the question where did nigel farage the political pied piper go wrong the first week of the brexit party campaign began with a stand off and ended with hundreds of candidates being stood down in the weeks before the election was called nigel farage had secretly offered to endorse the conservatives to back boris johnson publicly in exchange according to brexit party sources nigel farage wanted a free run at a handful of labour leave seats and an assurance from the prime minister of a hard brexit it was an offer immediately refused the conservatives have n't done formal election campaign deals with other parties since before the second world war and that was n't about to change that rejection was n't taken well and the bitterness it caused made nigel farage issue an ultimatum on the first day of the campaign it was a last ditch unite or we fight message delivered on stage at a church hall in westminster he urged boris johnson to drop the deal or he would unleash 600 candidates across the country to challenge the tories in every seat he compared the prime minister 's brexit deal to a faulty second hand motor and a polished up version of theresa may 's appalling surrender treaty setting off around the country he headed straight to the seats that the tories would need to win from labour if they had any chance of winning a majority bolsover was his first stop and he held that initial campaign rally in a boxing club the symbolism was blatant the gloves were off this was a labour stronghold but with a heavy leave vote there he told supporters that the brexit deal was a treaty that you would only sign if you had been defeated in war the tories could n't win there and only the brexit party could ensure a clean break from the eu it was fighting talk but by the end of a week of taking that message to hundreds of supporters in derbyshire nottinghamshire cumbria and south wales boris johnson was not budging behind the scenes senior conservatives had been calling farage warning him that he risked humiliation if he did n't stand down his plan to field hundreds of candidates they 're rattled one senior brexit party official told me the deadline for nominations was approaching but it was nigel farage that was being stared out and he would soon have to make a decision in newport on the friday of the first week of the campaign he held a rally and his language had noticeably changed now he was urging boris johnson to toughen up the deal he had caved in those same senior tories were also urging downing street to give nigel farage a ladder to climb down on as one put it to me on the sunday boris johnson released a social media video insisting brexit trade talks with the eu would not continue beyond the end of december 2020 a key demand from nigel farage had been met and that was enough for him to make a significant announcement the next morning his party would now not field candidates in the 317 seats won by the conservatives in 2017 it was the moment that the tories could now clearly see a majority in their sights without the risk of the brexit party splitting the leave vote it was arguably the turning point in the tory campaign the brexit party campaign itself continued with the leader on a nationwide tour but from then on it lacked momentum a number of candidates who 'd been stood down were now angry and disillusioned one called me to describe nigel farage as a megalomaniac leading some kind of cult meps defected warning that the leave vote was being split and that brexit itself was being threatened ironically by the brexit party the brexit party 's short eight month lifespan had seen extraordinary success winning the european elections in may thanks to leave voters liking the clear leave means leave message nigel farage re - elected again to the european parliament he 's been an mep since 1999 those shock results were a key factor in theresa may then standing down in his stump speeches farage often claimed credit for her departure those who know farage well praise his campaigning instincts his unfailing ability to judge the public mood for someone who tried and failed seven times to be an mp he has had more influence over the political direction of the entire country than most elected politicians but during this campaign it 's his tactics that have failed he overestimated his usefulness to boris johnson who snubbed him and clearly bargained that he could win a majority without farage 's help he let down many of the party faithful when he scaled back the ambitions the campaign was undermined by infighting and defections far right activists were exposed and in hartlepool where party chairman richard tice was standing a councillor and an official were dismissed for using racist language and islamophobic comments all captured by a channel four news undercover investigation after a cold damp winter election farage has been frozen out the ball had come out of the brexit scrum and was grabbed by boris johnson while nigel farage was forced to watch from the sidelines as the prime minister ran towards the line his legacy can not be underestimated the brexiter conservative andrew bridgen says farage was essential for getting us a referendum referring to his time as leader of ukip but that now when the dragon 's dead no one needs a dragon slayer brexit is now mainstream and the man who started off shouting in the wilderness all those years ago railing against the eu super - state has been drowned out by even louder more powerful voices during the campaign farage was asked what he would do if he lost if his brexit party failed to win a single seat you wo n't see me again he replied somehow i doubt that but if he carries on fighting for a proper brexit he risks being compared to one of the japanese soldiers who were still hiding out deep in the jungles of the south pacific in the 1960s refusing to accept that ww2 was over what now for nigel farage he says he 's registered a new party the reform party to change politics for good as the slogan goes that could be the next incarnation of the brexit party others who know him tell me he 'll move to the united states in the new year to work for fox news and on the 2020 campaign to re - elect the man he would coyly refer to in his speeches as his american friend donald trump that 's why he did n't stand for election himself this time around is the explanation they give to back up that claim there 's even talk of a knighthood arise sir nigel that might raise a few eyebrows but think back to that boxing ring in bolsover where he began the national campaign tour he 's the one who 's ended up being knocked out again but as we 've seen he 's never down for long by itv news content producer david williams whatever your politics it 's officially a blue christmas yes this rare festive election has been won emphatically by boris johnson 's conservatives on a night when the political map of britain was redrawn and re - coloured in

politically writes itv border political editor peter macmahon the scots in general appear not to have warmed to boris johnson and his brand of conservatism and again to generalise they seem to prefer the kind of politics which is put forward by ms sturgeon and the snp who are in power in holyrood we will have to wait for the final results and further research into them to determine whether the snp 's opposition to brexit or its support for a second independence referendum was the key factor or whether it might just be that this time around more independence supporters came out for the snp even if the tory vote was not wiped out or whether some electors labour or former labour voters lent the snp their vote to try to do what the first minister said were two of her objectives stopping brexit adn keeping boris johnson out of downing street whatever the reason and it could well be some mixture of all of them this result will massively strengthen the snp 's demand for a second independence

appeared to blame propaganda for the early election results she said unchecked targeted bespoke propaganda we need to start taking this seriously jo swinson began the liberal democrats election campaign with the claim she could be the next prime minister but in the end she could not even hold her own seat the mp for east dunbartonshire wanted to be known as leader of the self styled remain alliance of anti - brexit parties after taking the controversial policy stance that the lib dems would kill any attempt at eu withdrawal without the need for another referendum ms swinson 39 became her partys first female leader in a landslide victory over sir ed davey earlier this year after the lacklustre leaderships of tim farron and sir vince cable she had served as a minister in the coalition government and was among the partys mps who paid the price for the tie up with david camerons tories in the 2015 election bloodbath which saw the lib dems reduced to a rump of just eight in the commons ms swinson fought back when prime minister theresa may called another election in 2017 regaining her scottish seat from the snp ms swinson also made history when she became the first mp to take her baby into a commons debate when she took her second son gabriel into a discussion on proxy voting in september 2018 the former public relations specialist married ex - lib dem mp duncan hames who lost his seat at the 2015 general election in 2011 she was made a cbe for political and public service and has has also written abook equal power while the liberal democrats started the general election campaign strongly ms swinson soon attracted criticism from some quarters both for the policy of revoking brexit and for her previous record in coalition government some critics branded her as coming across as a bit preachy and ultimately her style failed to cut through with voters including in her own constituency where she has narrowly lost to the snp chuka umunna was once considered such a breath of fresh air that he was dubbed the british obama now like his stateside counterpart he is no longer on the front line of politics but unlike the former us president mr umunna failed to scale anywhere near the same heights on this side of the atlantic election 2019 labour seats held for decades turn blue as conservatives head for landslide victory he could n't lead the working class out of a paper bag alan johnson launches fierce attack on corbyn and momentum but it was not without trying there was a time long before jeremy corbyns name became known beyond the backbenches when he was considered the partys next great leader an accomplished politician in the mould of tony blair but he dramatically quit the race to succeed the lacklustre ed miliband in 2015 citing very real concerns and worry about this bids impact on those close to me despite being the front runner in a statement at the time mr umunna said one can imagine what running for leader can be like understand its demands and the attention but nothing compares to actually doing it and the impact on the rest of ones life consequently after further reflection i am withdrawing my candidacy sources close to mr umunna insisted that his withdrawal was not due to any negative story which he expected to appear in the media although he was uncomfortable with the increased level of scrutiny which had been directed at him and members of his family including his mother a polished media performer the former employment lawyers background as the son of a nigerian father and english irish mother gave him a different perspective on immigration he was popular in the streatham constituency he represented since 2010 a seat which voted nearly 80 % in favour of remaining in the eu but opted to stand for the cities of london and westminster in 2019 his centrist views often put him at loggerheads with mr corbyn as well as with the legion of new young labour members mr umunna left the party for good in february 2019 one of a glut of labour mps to defect to the newly formed the independent group tig saying the current party system was broken critics within labour said the defection was a result of him realising his dream of party leadership would be on ice while mr corbyn was in front bench politics and within months he defected again this time joining the lib dems despite previously posting on social media that he could nt forgive them for austerity during their time as coalition partners with the conservatives in the lead up to the 2019 general election mr umunna predicted his new party could get up to 100 seats in a forthcoming election the exit polls predicted otherwise and sadly for mr umunna the cities of london and westminster seat in which he stood was not among the partys successes
